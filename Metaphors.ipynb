      "Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: \"central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s\". Yet, we have seen how \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the \"normal mechanism\" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of \"austrian\" or \"hard-money\" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m reacceleration or does the link between Growth/\u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m outlook. #AskECB   \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly dis\u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0mary before the pandemic and \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0mary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0mary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m above 2% for the entire year. At which level \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the dis\u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0mary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: \u001b[1mINFLATION\u001b[0m has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Does the ECB take into account the asymmetries that are produced from its policies due to the fact that the EZ is not a proper monetary union? Do you think it should/shouldn't? Thank you   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further steps in European integration would clearly benefit our single monetary policy. Therefore we need to make further progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union. #AskECB    @ecb   Why would any Country give up their sovereign currency knowing that money can be printed instead of borrowed ? The US,UK,Can... have retained their sovereignty, they are in a better situation to react to \"shocks\" in the economy. natural or man made.   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro area countries have decided to give up their own currencies and join the euro. A currency union reduces transaction costs and facilitates trade by removing exchange rate risks. The euro enjoys wide support in all member countries. #AskECB   Also, how far can BVB go in the Champions League this season?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: All the way! #AskECB  Time to wrap up for today. Many thanks for your questions – I really enjoyed our chat! Take care, @Isabel_Schnabel #AskECB\n"

       "[\"Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by DAMPENing the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have SPARKed fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the FLARE-UP could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a FLARE-UP in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent SURGE in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.\",\n",
       " \"In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.\\xa0   Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.\\xa0  How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.\",\n",
       " 'Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!']"
