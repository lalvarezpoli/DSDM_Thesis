Example Input:
["China worries that such rapid growth could ignite inflation, and the countrys banking industry has been trying since last year to bring the rate down to 7 percent a year.",
"But the evidence from that earlier period is tainted by the fact that inflation was roaring at the time creating bracket creep, over-taxation of illusory capital gains and paper profits, and rising interest rates.",
"In addition, unemployment and inflation continued to plague the economy.",
"Analysts are concerned that rising gas prices may cut into consumer spending and trigger inflation.",
"However, progress is difficult when government spending is heavily dependent on foreign aid and 
investment must be curbed to keep inflation on its downward track.",
"Restrictive interest rates made sense in the first half of 2000, when GDP was growing at an annual rate of 
around 5%, fast enough to rekindle inflation.",
"Those reforms, engineered by former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, lifted state price controls in many 
economic spheres, spurring massive inflation that is still running between 20 and 30 percent monthly.",
"The bike was becoming something almost indispensable, a utilitarian piece of everyday middle-class 
weaponry meant to combat fuel-price inflation."]
