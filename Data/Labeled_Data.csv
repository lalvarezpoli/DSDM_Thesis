47,2009-09-12,"Interview with the ""Junge Zeitung“ of the Frankfurter Neue Presse",Jean-Claude Trichet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2009/html/sp090912.en.html,Information not found,,"Mr. President, as „Mr. Euro“: How many Euros do you have in your wallet?[end_answer] Not many. (Counts) I have 50 Euro in 20, 10 and 5 euro notes und 4.50 in euro coins. I think I don’t need more today.[end_answer] In your opinion: How important is the Euro for Europe?[end_answer] The Euro is extremely important for Europe. If you go back to the vision of the founding fathers of Europe, more than 50 years ago: They wanted to establish a common market, what we would call now a single market for our continent. An achieved single market also calls for a single currency. What would be the single market of the United States of America if they had different currencies in Florida, California, and Massachusetts? The Euro is also the powerful symbol of our European unity.[end_answer] What do you like about the Germans – and what not?[end_answer] I have known a number of German friends for a very long period of time. I had the privilege to work very closely with my friends Hans Tietmeyer, Karl-Otto Pöhl and Helmut Schlesinger. I had an extremely good relationship with President Köhler, when he and I were both Staatssekretär in our respective countries and were negotiating the Maastricht Treaty. And working with Otmar Issing and Jürgen Stark to the success of the euro has also been a great privilege. As you see, amongst many others, German friends with whom we have worked actively for the success of the European endeavour. And I have always appreciated the capacity of the German culture and the German public opinion to support sound and reasonable monetary and economic policies over the last 60 years. What I perhaps like a little less is the level of anxiety, of ‘Angst’, which exists. That is sometimes too high and doesn’t fit, in my opinion, to the kind of qualities that the German culture has.[end_answer] Do you still learn the German language?[end_answer] Yes. (wieder deutsch) Ich lerne Deutsch, aber es ist schwierig, und ich bin etwas aus der Übung. We speak English most of the time. Ich sprach Deutsch in Osnabrück (beim Sparkassen-Forum 2009 at the invitation of President Pöttering, at the time president of the European Parliament): It seems to me that I was well understood by the audience and I was very happy with that.[end_answer] Does a President of the ECB still have a private life? How often do you meet your children?[end_answer] I have two sons and four granddaughters. I meet my family as an average once every month, of course, more during vacation.[end_answer] You work in Frankfurt, a great city of culture. Have you ever visited a museum?[end_answer] True. I already knew Frankfurt. But when I came to live in Frankfurt I was very impressed by the number of museums and the quality of exhibitions, as also shown in international rankings. I was also quite amazed by the number of opera houses in the area: Frankfurt of course, but also Wiesbaden, Mainz and Darmstadt that you can reach by car within three quarters of an hour.[end_answer] Do you have enough time to visit a museum?[end_answer] My wife and I, we go regularly to the Städel and the Schirn, to name a few. We discovered a lot here. For example, we were very impressed by the exhibitions about Picasso’s theatre decorations or the impressionist ladies.[end_answer] And going to the opera?[end_answer] What I discovered in Germany was not only that you have a lot of opera houses in a small region but also that the production, the costumes, the “Bühne” were always very modern, which is impressive.[end_answer] Do you have a favourite opera?[end_answer] Yes, Don Juan.[end_answer] How many days of an average week do you usually spend in Frankfurt?[end_answer] My week often consists of seven working days, because we always have international meetings during the weekends, recently the G20 at the level of Ministers and Governors, for instance, in London and immediately after two very important meetings in Basel. My life is very intense, as is normal: As an average of the five normal working days I spend three working days in Frankfurt and two days elsewhere in Europe and the weekend, very often, in international meetings in the rest of the world.[end_answer] Do you have time for hobbies or sports?[end_answer] I walk. When I am on vacation I like sailing and other sea sports.[end_answer] Do you read any German literature?[end_answer] When I came to Frankfurt, whilst I had enormously appreciated Thomas Mann, I plunged into Goethe. I re-read “Werther”, this remarkable novel. I learned a lot about Goethe, Germany and also Frankfurt, in particular from “Dichtung und Wahrheit”. In a different cultural field Wim Wenders impressed me very much, especially the movie “Der Himmel über Berlin”, on the two angels over divided Berlin, their meditation and the “temptation of flesh”. The dialogues are from the German speaking writer Peter Handke.[end_answer] You already told us how busy you are. But do you have time to just stand in the kitchen and prepare your own meal?[end_answer] Often, when my wife is not here, I prepare my meal. It is not that I have the time, but that I must do it.[end_answer] So you don’t enjoy it?[end_answer] Not too much.[end_answer] But do you enjoy the wine from the Rheingau?[end_answer] Yes, I was already used to excellent German white wines. And I’m very impressed by the progress the winemakers made with red wines, which are more challenging to produce at this level of quality.[end_answer] What do you like in the German kitchen?[end_answer] I don’t know whether I should confess that in Frankfurt: I have a dedication to “Weißwurst”! I would prefer it very much to the regular “Frankfurter” sausages. But I’m not – not yet! - bold enough to take it for breakfast, with beer, like in Bavaria…[end_answer] Do you go to restaurants?[end_answer] From time to time, usually in the Westend, where there is an impressive number of Italian restaurants.[end_answer] How often do you travel to St. Malo?[end_answer] Not sufficiently, in my opinion. For vacation, and, apart from vacation, very rarely.[end_answer] Your plans after the end of your term in November, 2011?[end_answer] We’ll see. I have no plans till now. But I’m sure I will be very active.[end_answer] With employees from how many nations do you cooperate with?[end_answer] Here in this institution, we have the 27 nationalities that exist in the European Union. On top of that we have some other nationalities for limited periods of time.[end_answer] What do I need to study in order to get a job at the ECB?[end_answer] Of course there are a lot of possibilities. We need experts in finance, economics, management of human resources, legal issues, administration, accounting, etc. etc... We need a wide range of expertise.[end_answer] Where do I apply for a job?[end_answer] We have a website where you can apply. All procedures and rules are published there as well.[end_answer] How many young employees do you hire each year?[end_answer] The order of magnitude is around 130 as an average. In 2008 we recruited exactly 129 new members of staff.[end_answer] The blue “Euro” monument in front of this building - will it move to the Großmarkthalle too?[end_answer] It has not been decided yet. Perhaps Frankfurt would love to have this symbol of the Euro at the heart of the City of the Euro. Perhaps it would be better to have it with us. We will see.[end_answer] What’s the time schedule for the new skyscraper?[end_answer] The plan is that it will be achieved by the end of 2013 and that we will organise the move-in during the first semester of 2014.[end_answer] And the costs?[end_answer] As far as the construction costs are concerned of 500 million euro (based on constant prices of 2005). I would stick to that.[end_answer] Do you sometimes get annoyed with the preservationists/Denkmalschützern?[end_answer] We had some discussion, but now we have a good accord.[end_answer] What about the new Euro notes, due to come in some years: Which design do you imagine?[end_answer] You know that the first notes show bridges and gates in the various architectural styles of Europe. That has been appreciated very much by the people. Architecture is a remarkable symbol of Europe: Historically an architectural element might be born in a certain place, perhaps in Greece or in Rome or in other nations, but then it spreads all over Europe. This shows the capacity of the European to be very diverse, but to have a fundamental unity and their diversity. You won’t be surprised by the new series of notes because we will continue to have the same symbols.[end_answer] At the moment, there is no inflation. Can you say that you accomplished your mission? Or does the ECB fear deflation?[end_answer] We have a responsibility to deliver price stability for 330 million fellow citizens. This is our primary goal according to the Treaty and this is what the people are calling on us. Our definition of price stability is clear: inflation below, but close to two percent. Since the inception of the single currency we have preserved the Euro area well against inflation - and in the most recent period we also preserved well the Euro area from the materialisation of the risk of deflation. That being said we must remain alert.[end_answer] What was most impressive moment during your career?[end_answer] There have been a number of moments that I felt were important and impressive.[end_answer] I’ve been associated very closely to the construction of Europe, particularly to the strategy of my own country towards monetary and fiscal stability and structural reforms. When we decided to start this strategy - which I call the “competitive disinflation strategy” - in 1982 – 1983 it was a very moving moment.[end_answer] I experienced also very tense moments in the 80’s and the 90’s as president of the Paris Club for rescheduling the debts of the developing and emerging countries. I presided over the rescheduling of the debt of Brazil, of Poland, of Egypt, of Soviet Union.[end_answer] Finally I participated actively in the Maastricht Treaty negotiation. When it was decided by the heads of States and Governments that we will start the Euro no later than January, 1999, it was a moving historical moment.[end_answer] And more recently when on the 9th of August 2007 the Executive Board of the ECB had to take bold decisions to cope with the start of the turbulences on the money market that was also an important moment. (Anmerkung der Red.: Die EZB pumpte zu diesem Datum in bis dahin nicht gekanntem Umfang Liquidität in den Markt und war damit die weltweit erste Notenbank, die auf die Krise reagierte.)[end_answer] Do you personally still convert to Franc?[end_answer] No.[end_answer] Do you understand the Germans sometimes still regret the loss of their old D-Mark?[end_answer] The promise which was made to all nationalities, and in particular to the Germans before the euro started was the following: The new currency will be at least as confidence-inspiring and as a good store of value as the previous national one. And I can say today to you: The promise has been met. The Euro, which is now almost eleven years old, is as good a currency, as solid and stable as was the DM.","['fear deflation', 'inflation below', 'preserved the Euro area well against inflation', 'materialisation of the risk of deflation', 'competitive disinflation strategy']","['Or does the ECB fear deflation', 'Our definition of price stability is clear: inflation below, but close to two percent', 'Since the inception of the single currency we have preserved the Euro area well against inflation - and in the most recent period we also preserved well the Euro area from the materialisation of the risk of deflation', 'Since the inception of the single currency we have preserved the Euro area well against inflation - and in the most recent period we also preserved well the Euro area from the materialisation of the risk of deflation', 'When we decided to start this strategy - which I call the “competitive disinflation strategy” - in 1982 – 1983 it was a very moving moment']",1942,M,France,2003 - 2011,"['at the moment there be no inflation ', 'can you say that you accomplish your mission ?

65,2010-04-24,Interview with Expresso,Jean-Claude Trichet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2010/html/sp100424.en.html,Information not found,"Are we really leaving the crisis behind or are there still some risks ahead? Is there a risk of a double dip?[end_question] What are the main risks in your opinion? Still the financial system?[end_question] One of the problems of pro-cyclicality is that banks, despite the huge amount of liquidity, are not conceding enough credit do the economy.[end_question] Are they frightened about this financial crisis or still have lots of toxic assets on their balance sheets?[end_question] Do you expect new problems in the future in some of the euro area banks? I am thinking, for instance, in Irish banks where the government created recently a bad bank.[end_question] What is, in your opinion, the appropriate capital requirement for a bank?[end_question] You think that the exit strategies of the fiscal policy, namely in some countries higher deficits like Ireland, Portugal or Greece, are in themselves threats to the economic recovery?[end_question] But governments should be careful on the pace of fiscal tightening to avoid risks?[end_question] Do you think Portugal could experience in the future a situation similar to Greece if the government fails to accomplish Stability and Growth Program and bring the deficit to a level below 3% of GDP?[end_question] You know for some time our finance minister, Teixeira dos Santos. He was able to cut fiscal deficit between 2005 and 2008. Is he the right person to do it again right now?[end_question] Is it fair that some countries like Portugal or Ireland, with their own fiscal problems, could be called to participate in the solution for Greece financing its debt?[end_question] Should the euro area and European Union create an institutional framework, like a European Monetary Fund, to solve this kind of problem?[end_question] You think that this solution to Greece is enough to calm down the financial markets?[end_question] Was this financial crisis your most difficult task in the ECB?[end_question] Was the financial sector, and banks in particular, too optimistic about the possibility of this kind of crisis?[end_question] Are bankers already prepared to be careful in the future or should the regulators impose on them that kind of behaviour?[end_question] Was there a threat of a new Great Depression?[end_question] Is the euro area economy in worst shape than the US economy? Is the US recovering faster?[end_question] In terms of structural reforms, is this an urgent need for Portugal?[end_question] Next June you will have a new vice-president, Vítor Constâncio. Was he a good choice for the job?","As regards the conjuncture in the real economy, what it is clear is that on the global level we are in a recovery mode. That is particularly visible in the emerging countries, in emerging Asia especially but and also in Brazil and in Latin America. The emerging world is picking up now very clearly and that is excellent for global growth. As regards the financial sector and financial aspects of the global economy, I would say that there is still of course very hard work for drawing all the lessons from the crisis. We have to be sure that we have a global financial system which would be much more resilient than it was before the crisis. It is work in progress. It is the work we have started in the auspices of the G20, the work that we are doing with the Financial Stability Board, with the Basel Committee, with all the workshops that have been established at a global level. For the banks, we will have decisions by the end of the year on the capital requirements, new rules and regulations at a global level. We are bound to learn the appropriate lessons and to pave the way for a global financial system which should be much more solid. We cannot afford to have twice the same acute degree of instability. For several reasons, I think people would not tolerate that. Our democracies have accepted a level of taxpayer risk that has been extremely elevated to avoid the collapse of financial sector. I do not think they will accept that twice.[end_answer] We always have risks in a market economy. There was no risk in the Soviet economy, but this absence of risk led the economy to a total collapse. In a market economy, you have to permanently identify and analyse risks, you must have the best risk management possible to be sure that you prevent the materialization of risks both at the level of individual institutions and at the systemic level itself.[end_answer] In the present moment, we still have all the risks associated with the fact that we have not yet achieved the work that we started at the end of 2008 and have not yet drawn all the lessons from the crisis. We still have to make very significant progress to improve transparency and to combat short-termism. We have to counter pro-cyclicality, which is one of the features of global finance today, amplifying the booms and the busts of global economy. Promoting and improving transparency, countering short-termism and eliminating as much as possible pro-cyclicality are three of the most important avenues we have to take.[end_answer] I confirm that, of course. We did by means of so called ‘non-conventional measures’ all what we could to permit the commercial banks to continue to finance the real economy as well as possible despite the crisis. We did that in a manner which has been prompt and decisive in terms of quantity and quality of the measures taken. Now we are progressively unwinding these measures. This unwinding is fully in line with the fact that the markets are progressively functioning better. As regards the banks our message is: do not forget that what we are doing ourselves is to permit you to finance the real economy and do your job.[end_answer] After every recession – we avoided a depression but we had a sharp recession -, we observe that there was a period of decreasing outstanding credit to the private sector. As a rule, recovery of credit has always been more rapid for the households than for the corporate business.[end_answer] I would call all responsible authorities, private or public, to be very alert. The cleaning up of bank balance sheets is in line with what we recommend. We have a very simple message for all banks in euro area: to do their job financing the real economy; to do all they can to restructure their balance sheets to be able to finance the economy including taking advantage of the market possibilities to issue new capital, utilizing their retained earnings to reinforce their own funds and have moderate remuneration. In a small number of cases we are also telling them to utilize the options offered by governments to restructure their balance sheets.[end_answer] We will see. We have opened up the discussion with the private sector. The Basel Committee is gathering all the responses from the industry that were due by the end of April. We will work intensively, at the level of the international community, on the appropriate calibration of the new Basel rules.[end_answer] We in the ECB Governing Council have always defended fiercely the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). We have always drawn the attention of the governments to the fact that the SGP was essential and crucial for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). For all governments, the sound management of fiscal policies is essential, not only because they are part of the EMU, not only because it is both moral and common sense behaviour to protect the children and the grandchildren and not to impose on them an abnormal burden, but also because it is a crucial element in of the confidence of the households, entrepreneurs and market participants. That is the reason why we see no contradiction between the objective to permit the economic recovery to expand and be active as possible, and the sound management of fiscal policies.[end_answer] Governments should be aware of the fact that if they do not do what is necessary to be credible in having a sustainable fiscal position in the medium term, they will not create confidence. If they do not create confidence in their capacity to run sustainable fiscal policies they will not help the recovery today. Because the recovery today depends crucially on the confidence of households, of fellow citizens and of enterprises.[end_answer] The countries are all in very different situations. That being said all governments of the euro area, without exception, have the task to be credible in the sustainability of their fiscal policies. It is our permanent message.[end_answer] It is not the responsibility of the ECB to give good marks and bad marks to finance ministers! All what goes resolutely and courageously in the direction of sound fiscal policies and improvements in the cost competitiveness of the economy has to be accelerated. It is essential.[end_answer] All the countries, without any exception, have to behave properly to have good management of their fiscal policy, good monitoring of their relative competitiveness, of their unit labour costs, of their structural reforms and overall competitive indicators. They all have to collectively exercise strong surveillance on the individual governments of the euro area, impose strong conditionality where needed and fully recognize that they are sharing a destiny in common.[end_answer] Firstly, the SGP is there precisely to organize peer surveillance of the sixteen members. The close monitoring of the policies pursued by each of the sixteen and the good functioning of this peer surveillance is absolutely essential. If we have a reinforced surveillance on the members of the euro area themselves, we will not have problems in the future. Secondly, I think the task force presided over by Mr Van Rompuy, according to a decision taken by the heads of state and government, will concentrate on how we could improve surveillance and - when necessary - the conditionality that the euro area will impose on each of its members, in line with the Treaty.[end_answer] I already said what I have to say on that.[end_answer] We have no ‘most difficult task’. We have to be permanently alert. As you know, the ECB has been very alert. Before the crisis, we warned against the possibility of a market correction of great magnitude. We said that, I said that myself, in 2006 and at the beginning of 2007. We were the first central bank in the world, in August 2007, to assess that a period of financial turbulences was starting and to take appropriate decisions. That was, of course, a very difficult decision to take based upon this new turbulent market environment we had to cope with at that time. We had a lot of difficult decisions to take, like all other major central banks of the world, after the intensification of the crisis, which took place mid-September 2008, when we decided to embark on a series of non-conventional measures. We have to be alert, all of us, permanently, to stand ready to respond to events that are very difficult to predict and in their nature are unique.[end_answer] It is unfortunately clear that the financial sector had very mediocre risk-management in the years preceding this crisis. There was a sentiment that risks could be taken and the eventuality of their materialization was not perceived by market participants and institutions. Furthermore, a number of financial instruments emerging were abnormally complex, and did not allow the final investor to be transparently informed. We were in an environment which proved to be simultaneously intransparent, complex and extremely risky. We have to be sure we are correcting all that and improving every part and parcel of global finance in the future.[end_answer] We need both. We need, of the course, the private sector to be fully aware of the risks that might emerge. It is clear that, for the private sector as a whole the crisis was a tough lesson, so they have all changed their behaviour. They have all spontaneously, under the pressure of this intense crisis, improved their risk management. They learnt their lesson the hard way. The regulators themselves have to push them in the right direction and to impose on them what they do not do spontaneously. It is in a way a dramatic change of culture that we have to process with the efforts of the authorities and public sector, as well as the private sector, in global finance and, therefore, the global economy.[end_answer] What we had in 2008 and 2009 was a crisis which was graver than the worst crisis since World War II. If we had not been prompt and bold in the constituency of central banks and executive branches we would probably have had to cope with the worst crisis since World War I. We would probably have a depression, a very profound depression at global level. The threat was grave and immediate. That is one of the reasons why we have to be sure that we have much more solid and resilient global finance and global economy.[end_answer] Each economy has its own features, its own characteristics, its own structures. When you compare figures you have also to take into consideration a significant difference which is due to difference in demographics that are much more dynamic in the US. You have also to consider that we have, in Europe, a connection to the rest of the global economy which is not the same in the US. All that being said, I think Europe has a lot to do to improve macro-policies, in particular fiscal policy, but also to be very active in the field of structural reforms. It is extremely important that the new 2020 project, which succeeded the Lisbon Agenda, will be done at utmost level of responsibility and determination. Because the big difference between Europe and the US is the flexibility of the economy. As a consolidated economic entity, whether at the level of the euro area or of the European Union as a whole, we are macroeconomically close to balance with no significant current account imbalances. We are financing our own investment with our own savings. Which is not necessarily the case in the US. But on the other hand, we have an economy that is not sufficiently flexible. We have to embark on bold, structural reforms and be very much active on that if we want again growth and prosperity.[end_answer] I think that it is very urgent and very important for all European countries, and of course, amongst them, for Portugal.[end_answer] Vítor Constâncio has been a very active member of the team of the Eurosystem for a long period of time, a very active participant of the Governing Council and General Council of the ECB. The Governing Council was requested to give its own opinion which was positive.

73,2011-10-18,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,Jean-Claude Trichet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2011/html/sp111018.en.html,Information not found,"Mr Trichet, do you believe in destiny?[end_question] You have also talked about a common destiny in connection with the euro and the sovereign debt crisis. Is destiny not the opposite of a free political decision on whether or not to pursue a particular form of European integration?[end_question] And in that respect, we share a “common destiny”. Many politicians have described our currency union as a matter of war and peace. Is that an exaggeration?[end_question] What is wrong with remaining dwarves?[end_question] Is the success of our currency union a precondition for the success of the European project?[end_question] You like to point out that average inflation in the euro area has been lower than…[end_question] But inflation is not the only thing that the Germans fear. They are also scared that they will end up being responsible for the debts of other countries. Can you understand that?[end_question] Do you think Germany has changed over the years?[end_question] Do you have the impression that the Germans are too scared?[end_question] Over the last few months you have – as result, among other things, of the ECB’s buying of government bonds – been heavily criticised by people in Germany, including your friends. Do you feel misunderstood?[end_question] What do you say to your critics?[end_question] Some German central bankers say that the ECB’s actions have taken it to the limit of what is defensible, while others say that it has overstepped this limit.[end_question] But is that also true of the non-standard measures?[end_question] You must admit that you find that flattering.[end_question] In Germany there is a debate about whether the voting rights in the ECB’s Governing Council should be redistributed. Instead of the rule that each member has one vote, there would be a weighting according to capital share. Is that conceivable?[end_question] Will European integration, as currently foreseen, be possible without excessive transfer payments?[end_question] Why do you believe that the new Stability and Growth Pact will not fail just as the old one did?[end_question] This crisis has also changed the role of the ECB. Is there not a risk of the central bank taking on too much responsibility and overdoing things? You sent the Italians a letter in which you set out what the country needs to do in order to get the debt crisis under control. That is not the type of letter that central banks usually send to governments, is it?[end_question] What exactly caused the ECB to step in?[end_question] Will the ECB not stretch itself too far through the politicisation of its role?[end_question] But why is the ECB constantly seen at the centre of the action and on the political stage?[end_question] Will the euro still be around in ten years?","I have used that term on a few occasions – including the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the ECB, when I quoted Konrad Adenauer. He once said that Europe is a community with a common destiny. He also said that “it’s up to us to shape that destiny”, and I believe he was right.[end_answer] That is certainly not the way that I interpret the word “destiny”, and it’s definitely not Konrad Adenauer’s understanding, either. It’s certainly not a question of predetermination. It relates, instead, to the fundamental importance of the close unity, interdependence and friendship by which the people of Europe choose to bind themselves in today’s world.[end_answer] The process of integration has enabled Europe to enjoy more than half a century of peace, prosperity and stability. Were we to begin regressing, we would place this stability in jeopardy. From an economic perspective, the rationale for pursuing integration is far stronger today than it was in the immediate aftermath of the war. Back then, China, India and Latin America did not have the considerable economic importance that they have today. Demographic developments have also tended to increase the importance of European integration. We Europeans, if we act alone in our individual countries, will gradually look like dwarves relative to developments in the rest of the world.[end_answer] There are different ways of looking at this. But what was the original concept of Europe after the war? Our role model was the single US market. The view taken at the time was that, if we want to achieve prosperity and peace, we have to enjoy the same economies of scale and the same free market as the United States. That was the view of Europe’s founding fathers. If it was true then, it is even truer today.[end_answer] Our currency union is the most advanced element in the process of European integration. It is the most appropriate means of realising our founding fathers’ vision of a single market in Europe. After all, you could hardly imagine a single market in the United States with different currencies in Massachusetts, Florida and California.[end_answer] Average annual inflation has, at 2.0% over the first 13 years, been much lower than it was before the euro in a number of member countries, and also lower than it was under the Deutsche Mark over the previous 50 years. Our primary objective of price stability is the needle in our compass.[end_answer] First of all, I don’t like this talk of “the Germans”, “the Italians” or “the French”. We live in democracies. Our mandate is to ensure price stability. We have delivered price stability, and the markets clearly trust us to continue doing so for the next ten years. The question of debts and who should be responsible for them needs to be put to national governments. First, to the governments who behaved improperly in the past and accumulated excessive levels of debt. And second, to the governments who simply accepted that behaviour on the part of their neighbours. We, the Executive Board and Governing Council of the ECB, have spent years arguing publicly against infringements of the Stability and Growth Pact and warning of the dangers that this poses.[end_answer] I have, of course, had the opportunity to discover much of Germany for myself and have gained a lasting impression of this country. This is due, among other things, to the fact that I have many, many friends here – friends such as Jürgen Stark, Horst Köhler, Theo Waigel and Hans Tietmeyer and many more. So, I have close ties with Germany. I have observed changes in Germany which are highly significant from an economic perspective. A simple example is the fact that, when I moved to Frankfurt eight years ago, the shops were shut by late afternoon – and shut all afternoon on Saturdays! Now, some are still open at 10 p.m., which my wife particularly appreciates. This is a small thing, but it shows that the country is changing extremely quickly.[end_answer] As regards inflation, I understand the deep-seated fears of many German citizens, given their experience of hyperinflation in the 1920s. In fact, a lot of people feel much the same way in France. The French experienced hyperinflation at the time of the revolution. This experience of the “assignats” – paper money introduced during the French revolution that lost all but a fraction of its value in just a few years – continued to have an impact right up to the Second World War. But what matters is the fact that today we have price stability in the medium term and inflation expectations are firmly anchored. The thing about Germany is that, given its export-oriented economy, it is widely acknowledged by employees and workers that international competition means that there is limited room for manoeuvre. In other countries, the weight of the public sector is much greater and the percentage of the private sector which is engaged in the production of tradable goods is smaller. As a result, there tends to be less recognition of the importance of competitiveness than there is here. In this respect, Germany is particularly well equipped to meet the demands of international competition.[end_answer] This means that we have to tirelessly explain what we are doing. We have strictly separated (in accordance with the “separation principle”) our interest rates, which are designed to deliver price stability, and our “non-standard measures”, which are helping to improve the transmission of our interest rates in this period of market disruption. We cannot ignore the fact that we are experiencing the worst global financial crisis for 66 years![end_answer] What exactly is the criticism? Have we delivered price stability since the inception of the euro – both before and during the crisis? Are we credible in delivering price stability over the next ten years? The answer to these two questions is “yes”. We are conducting monetary policy for our 332 million fellow citizens in 17 countries. We design all our non‑standard measures – the full allotment of liquidity at fixed rates, the covered bond purchase programme and the Securities Markets Programme – to be commensurate to the market disruption, in order to improve the transmission of our monetary policy.[end_answer] We are entitled to use all of the instruments mentioned, since the transmission of monetary policy is at risk if interest rates for “risk-free” monetary and financial investment instruments in the individual euro area countries are hampering our monetary policy. At the same time, we have always made it clear that financial stability is the responsibility of governments. We had to intervene – for monetary reasons – only because for a long time governments did not take their responsibility for ensuring financial stability seriously. Have we perhaps gone too far as regards our monetary policy? To answer that, we should look at the policy rates of other currency areas, such as Japan or the United States, which are much lower than ours. Any comparison with other important advanced economies’ central banks shows that we are actually very prudent in our application of non-standard measures.[end_answer] Again, the comparison is simple. Look at the evolution of central banks’ balance sheets since the start of the crisis. Our balance sheet has increased by around 80%. On the other side of the Atlantic, the equivalent balance sheet has grown by 226%. None of us can ignore the crisis. Drawing on the ideas of the great German thinker Max Weber, I would say that we have to rely on both the ethic of conviction, which I associate with the interest rate measures, and the ethic of responsibility, which I associate with all the non-standard measures. And we have to do that in a highly responsible way. That being said, did you know that in my own country I was called the “ayatollah of the strong franc” and “Tietmeyer’s clone”?[end_answer] It was meant as very harsh and serious criticism by some in my home country. On the other hand, there are also those in Germany who are not critical. I was awarded the Karlspreis in Aachen and the Global Economy Prize in Kiel. This was a very great honour for me and both were very moving occasions.[end_answer] When Monetary Union was set up, the “one member, one vote” rule was an important requirement for Germany. A different approach would have been possible, but Germany was afraid that there would be a nationalisation of the behaviour of the Governing Council members. When the EU was enlarged, the voting rules of the Governing Council were reformed in the Treaty of Nice in order to safeguard the decision-making capacity of the Governing Council in the enlarged EU. The idea of taking into account the size of the respective countries has thus already been implemented.[end_answer] We should make a distinction between assistance, transfers and loans. The Treaties do not prohibit loans between member countries. It would not be conceivable on any continent for countries not to help each other out with loans bearing interest, for instance to complement IMF loans. The Treaties do prohibit subsidies and transfers. In addition, it should be possible in future to impose decisions on countries that persist in not complying with the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby putting at risk the stability of Monetary Union. In my view, the Treaties would need to be amended to this end.[end_answer] It is much stricter, although not as strict as we would have liked it to be. In addition, the euro area countries have been made painfully aware of the dangers of constant violation. They have learned the hard way that benign neglect is not acceptable.[end_answer] You know, much of what we have developed and put into practice in Europe has gradually gained acceptance throughout the world. That is true of the deficit limit of 3% of GDP, of the inflation target of just below 2%, and of the central bank’s press conference. And the same is also true of the tradition of the Bundesbank, the Banque de France and other European central banks to voice their opinion on fiscal policy. This has proved to be worthwhile. The reason that we are experiencing such great difficulties and that we have this government debt crisis is that for too long the governments of the advanced economies and of Europe in particular did not live up to their fiscal responsibilities.[end_answer] There was a decision to expand the rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, and to broaden its mandate so that it can purchase government bonds. All 17 Heads of State or Government signed up to this decision. There were then delays, and so the ECB once again found itself in a situation where it had to intervene in the bond market in order to safeguard the transmission of monetary policy. We had to act decisively vis-à-vis savers and investors throughout the world. We had to send a message to governments about what, in our opinion, could be done in order to retain the confidence of the markets. But we never act as a substitute for the governments’ responsibility and decisions.[end_answer] We are not politicising our role. We are executing our monetary policy responsibly in accordance with the Treaty, fully in line with the European tradition as regards our call for sound fiscal policies, at a time of the worst crisis since the Second World War. The Europeans are making history. There has never before been an attempt to bring together 17 countries, including the world’s third, fourth, sixth and eighth largest industrialised economies. This is, of course, ambitious. And the crisis is acting in advanced economies as an X-ray picture: it is revealing the weaknesses of all. In our case, it is the weaknesses of the governance of Economic Union.[end_answer] The ECB is the most developed institution of integrated Europe, and the institution that is fully able to take action. Something that also plays a role is the fact that Europe’s capitals – unlike us – may not have at all times a complete and immediate picture of the crisis situation. From this institution, we have the complete picture, worldwide and in Europe. It is simply our duty to pass on this picture to the leaders of our democracies. Sometimes they follow us, sometimes they don’t. The responsibility lies with the governments. The most important thing for the ECB is to ensure medium and long-term stability, and that is why it cannot use monetary policy to put right the failings of government policies.[end_answer] Not only will it be there in ten years’ time, the information that we obtain from investors and savers indicates that it will ensure price stability in line with our definition: less than 2%, but close to 2%.

79,2011-09-20,Interview with Expansión,Jean-Claude Trichet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2011/html/sp110920.en.html,Information not found,"1. At the last meeting you said that the risks to inflation are balanced and you noted downside risks to growth. However, the ECB raised interest rates in April and July. Does this new scenario leave room for possible rate cuts in the medium term? In 2008, following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, there was a major shift in your monetary policy.[end_question] 2. Investors are very concerned by the departure of Jürgen Stark, just a few months after Axel Weber stepped down. What are the consequences of his departure for the ECB and do you have any reassurance to offer in this regard?[end_question] 3. These two resignations were related to opposition to the purchase of sovereign bonds. What is the limit of the Securities Markets Programme?[end_question] 4. Has the current crisis exceeded all your expectations?[end_question] 5. But what is the real source of the problem?[end_question] 6. Angela Merkel sent us a very optimistic message about Greece this week. Do you think that, at present, there is a real risk that Greece will become insolvent?[end_question] 7. Nouriel Roubini, Bill Gross of PIMCO and George Soros, among other renowned economists, have been issuing catastrophic messages about the future of the euro since the start of the crisis. Don’t you think they should be more cautious, given that their views often have an impact on the market?[end_question] 8. Do you think that Spain is implementing sufficient reforms? What else can it do to restore investor confidence?[end_question] 9. Most European governments have completed the process of restructuring their financial sectors, but the Spanish government will still have to inject a large sum into several financial institutions at the end of September. What is your view of the situation of Spain’s financial sector?[end_question] 10. What are the challenges facing the new President, Mario Draghi?[end_question] 11. Could you give us your view of your eight years in office? Do you have any regrets or is there anything that you wish you had done differently?[end_question] 12. What is it that has gone wrong in this crisis? What recommendations would you give?[end_question] 13. The markets fear liquidity problems in the European banking sector. Do you think this is an understandable concern? The ECB has just announced a joint action with the Federal Reserve System to lend dollars to the European banks. What has brought us to this situation? Could the ECB embark upon other measures, for example more twelve-month tenders? In addition, the liquidity crisis is reducing the banks’ capital. In this context, will they be able to strengthen their positions themselves or will they require external support, perhaps through the European Financial Stability Facility or some other means?","At the last meeting of the Governing Council we delivered two main messages. In our assessment the outlook for the real economy has deteriorated and we think that there are downside risks to growth. This is a significant change compared with the assessment three months ago, when we thought that the risks were balanced. On the other hand, in July there were upside risks to inflation, but now they are balanced. We will continue to keep price expectations solidly anchored. This is a major asset for Europe: it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation.[end_answer] The Governing Council has been totally faithful to the primary mandate of the ECB which is price stability. The track record for the first 12 years is impressive: price stability is the best it has been for the last 50 years for 332 million fellow European citizens. We will continue to fulfil our mandate with dedication. Jürgen has been a marvellous partner and colleague for me for the past 18 years. He has always demonstrated a very strong commitment to the consolidation of European unity. We have worked together for five years at the ECB and I must stress his constant loyalty to our institution. I have a deep esteem for him.[end_answer] The Securities Markets Programme (SMP) is a non-standard measure that the Governing Council decided on in order to help restore a more correct monetary policy transmission mechanism at a time when we are observing major disruptions to markets or segments of markets. Since the start of the crisis in 2007 we have applied a strict “separation of principles” between the two categories of measures. On one side are the standard measures – the interest rates – that are designed to deliver price stability, and on the other are the non-standard measures designed to be commensurate with the degree of disruption to markets. This is the case for all our non-standard measures: the supply of liquidity with a full allotment at fixed rate, the purchase of covered bonds and the SMP. In the case of the SMP, we consider that governments have the responsibility to ensure, individually and collectively, financial stability, which will re-establish a more correct functioning of markets. It is their responsibility and it is the commitment they took on 21 July.[end_answer] I said myself, on behalf of the central bankers participating in the Global Economy meeting in 2006 and at the beginning of 2007, that a significant market correction was likely because risks were underestimated, insurance premia too low and volatility abnormally low. Since August 2007 we have experienced several episodes of a global crisis that is extremely demanding and calls for all authorities and entities, public and private, to live up to their responsibilities.[end_answer] The current episode of the crisis is a crisis of the sovereign signatures, due to fiscal imbalances. The Governing Council of the ECB constantly advised governments that they should strictly respect the Stability and Growth Pact, individually and collectively. I was on record, on behalf of the Governing Council, in stating, many many times, that we have a single currency and no federal budget, meaning that the Stability and Growth Pact was fundamental for the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). We fiercely defended the Stability and Growth Pact against the major countries of Europe when they wanted to dismantle it in 2004 and 2005. Let me also stress that it is a global crisis, hitting all major advanced economies, with its epicentre in Europe.[end_answer] Greece has to strictly implement its adjustment programme and reach all its targets. This is absolutely fundamental. All governments have to fully implement their decisions which were adopted on 21 July in Brussels.[end_answer] One should not confuse the issue of financial stability in the euro area and the necessity to adjust fiscal policies, which are an important and pressing problem, with the euro as a currency. Since its inception, the euro has kept its value remarkably. Price stability has been ensured in a better fashion than with the previous national currencies. It is the currency for the euro area as a whole. And the euro area as a whole has a balanced current account and a public finance deficit much lower than many big advanced economies. Such a currency, with such strong underlying fundamentals, is solid and credible.[end_answer] Spain should resolutely continue to place particular emphasis on further structural reforms in order to have the highest possible level of growth potential, to improve its productivity and to restore investor confidence.[end_answer] The situation has improved considerably, but one should remain permanently alert. Every month the Governing Council of the ECB calls upon all the banks in Europe to do all that is necessary to reinforce their balance sheets, to retain earnings, to be cautious and moderate as regards remuneration and to have recourse to a public backstop, where necessary.[end_answer] Every central banker faces the challenge of being the guardian of the currency, and therefore an anchor of stability and confidence in a very demanding period. Mario Draghi needs no particular advice from me. He is a long-standing member of the ECB’s Governing Council and has been closely involved in all the decisions we have taken over the years.[end_answer] I have not gone yet and I have a very demanding task ahead of me in the remaining month and a half. In any case, I can assure you that it has been very inspiring to be President of a monetary institution that is responsible for issuing the common currency for 332 million people in 17 countries, including Spain. This is a great responsibility. As you know, in the Governing Council of 23 members, we are a team, together with Miguel Ángel Fernández Ordóñez and José Manuel González Páramo. We are all very close and this is something that is very inspiring. The team’s spirit means so much to me.[end_answer] Emerging economies have shown remarkable overall behaviour in the face of this crisis, unlike the advanced economies. I think the main lesson to be learnt is that we have to make a difference as regards the resilience of the advanced economies. And this requires the implementation of a very robust fiscal policy, a very strong monitoring of competitive indicators in all economies and in particular in the euro area, and bold structural reforms.[end_answer] As I already said, the European banking sector has to reinforce its balance sheet and improve its resilience. As regards its access to liquidity, I think it is important for observers and market participants to know that the ECB is supplying liquidity in euro on an unlimited basis at fixed rates for durations of one week, one month and three months. And the eligible collateral in the hands of the banking sector is a multiple of the amount of liquidity we are presently supplying (around €530 billion). As regards the liquidity in dollars, we just announced last Thursday the agreement between five central banks, which has been well understood by the observers and illustrates the very close cooperation which exists, in particular between the Federal Reserve System and the ECB.","['upside risks to inflation', 'materialisation of the risk of inflation', 'materialisation of the risk of deflation']","['On the other hand, in July there were upside risks to inflation, but now they are balanced', 'This is a major asset for Europe: it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation', 'This is a major asset for Europe: it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation']",1942,M,France,2003 - 2011,"['on the other hand in July there be upside risk to inflation but now they be balanced ', 'this be a major asset for Europe it protect we from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation ']","['on the other hand in July there be upside risk to inflation but now they be balanced ', 'this be a major asset for Europe it protect we from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation ']",2,2,7295,[],0,"['On the other hand in July there were upside risks to inflation but now they are balanced.', 'This is a major asset for Europe it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation.']",3,2,"['on the other hand in july there were upside risks to inflation but now they are balanced', 'this is a major asset for europe it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation']","['orientation', 'warfare']","[True, True]",[],[],0,"['disease', 'disease', 'disease']",3,3,"['on the other hand in july there were upside risks to inflation but now they are balanced', 'this is a major asset for europe it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation']","['orientation', 'disease']","['on the other hand in july there were upside risks to inflation but now they are balanced', 'this is a major asset for europe it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation']","['orientation', 'disease']","['on the other hand in july there were upside risks to inflation but now they are balanced', 'this is a major asset for europe it protects us from the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as the materialisation of the risk of deflation']","['orientation', 'disease']","['orientation', 'disease']","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, True]"
85,2011-06-16,Interview with The Times,Jean-Claude Trichet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2011/html/sp110616_2.en.html,Information not found,"The Times: There are two camps: one that emphases the benefits of the euro and another group that says look at what happened in Greece, Portugal and Ireland - this shows that the project is fundamentally flawed. Why are you in the first camp?[end_question] But if you are in Greece, Portugal, Ireland or even to an extent in Spain you will look and say it is a success if you are in Germany or in Northern Europe but if you are dealing with the changed public services, or the unemployment levels, the euro doesn’t feel like a success.[end_question] A lot of central banks are emphasising the fragility of the recovery, yet at the same time the ECB is tightening policy. Why is there this different position between, for example, the Fed and Bank of England on one side and the ECB on the other?[end_question] We had some words from Barack Obama last week about the importance that this crisis is well-handled, saying if it is not well handled it could have serious consequences for the US economy. Would you share that view?[end_question] The projections now suggest that Greek obligations to the official sector could in a couple outweigh Greek obligations to the private sector. That underlies why those in Germany say we should have private sector involvement. Do you not accept their logic?[end_question] Do you think a compromise is possible on this?[end_question] There was a story a few weeks ago that some in Greece were considering a withdrawal from the euro. Has anyone in an official position ever raised with you that possibility?[end_question] And likewise Ireland and Portugal?[end_question] What would you say would be the consequences of such a thing?[end_question] You have bailout fatigue in Germany and austerity fatigue in Greece. Do you worry about the strain this situation is putting on the compact between democratic leaders and their populations?[end_question] The Aachen speech talked of a common European finance ministry: it seemed this would be an EU27 idea. Do you worry that the likes of Britain would see this as a threat to their sovereignty?[end_question] Perhaps this is a day after tomorrow question also; do you see it as Britain’s destiny to join the euro one day even if it seems unlikely today?[end_question] Does the Latin American debt crisis offer any lessons for this one?[end_question] You were the author of the 3pc limit in the Maastricht Criteria and, when you were confirmed by the European Parliament, even then you were emphasising over and over again the importance of getting the fiscal side right. No one listened. Why will they listen this time?[end_question] The other big lesson that emerges from reading about your earlier experiences before joining the ECB was your role in the franc fort. How important was the benefit that France evidently received from that policy in influencing the way you have approached your job in the ECB?[end_question] I have heard it said that what Europe faces as a whole now is a crisis of competitiveness, vis-à-vis China for instance. What Germany succeeded in doing much of the West hasn’t, and China provides a huge wake-up call for the West.[end_question] One of the impacts of the rise of emerging economies is the strain it puts on resources. This is also going to put a lot of strain on central bankers: how should central bankers respond via monetary policy to what could be a secular long-term increase in the price of raw materials?[end_question] What are your plans after you retire after the ECB?","Jean-Claude Trichet: All advanced economies are still going through the aftermath of the worst crisis in 60 years. It could even have been the worst crisis since World War I, if central bank and governments had not taken tough and bold decisions. Had public authorities not acted, we would not have avoided a major depression. I am absolutely convinced of that.[end_answer] What we are reflecting upon in Europe is not that different from the important discussions and reflections that are taking place in the US or Japan. Were we on a sustainable long term path on the previous business model? It seems to me that no big advanced economy – including the UK – can avoid to embark on a strategic reflection after this global crisis. It is not at all surprising that we in the euro area, as one of the big advanced economies, are reflecting on our business model, on our governance and measures to reinforce our resilience.[end_answer] What is very important is that a bird’s eye view of the euro area gives elements that are rather encouraging and which are often not perceived: the euro area as a whole is less indebted and far less in deficit on a yearly basis than the US and Japan. Our current account is balanced, and our growth has been rather encouraging since the recovery started in the third quarter of 2009. As regards growth and job creation, compared with the US we have more or less the same growth per capita and we created more jobs since 1999.[end_answer] But this is no time for complacency in any respect. The big issue to be addressed is to strengthen our surveillance of economic policies by member states. These economic policies are very important in a single currency area – fiscal policy on one hand and macroeconomic policies, including indicators of imbalances and competitiveness, on the other hand. “Economic Union” has to be improved considerably. That being said, as regards “Monetary Union”, twelve years after the launch of the single currency, I can say that the euro is there, it is credible and it maintained price stability even better than was expected by almost all observers. Annual average inflation over the past 12 years has been less than 2%, close to 2%. This is better than in the euro area countries over the last 50 years. As a stable currency the euro is undoubtedly a success.[end_answer] You have to judge the euro area as a whole. I fully agree we have to improve the interaction between national economic policies in a number of domains and the surveillance by the centre; that is clear. It’s absolutely clear that a country like Greece, for example, had a long period of growth that was largely artificial, boosted by unsustainable fiscal expansion. In such a case, the correction after such a period is necessary to bring the economy back on a sustainable path. It is clear that in any large economy, and also in a single currency area, it is extremely important to prevent divergences of this dimension driven by distortions. We have to be aware such issues are inherent for virtually all vast continental economies.[end_answer] It is not for me to comment on other monetary policies. What I would say is that in our case it is very important that we continue to anchor very solidly inflation expectations. We consider that such anchoring has been a very important element in the way we went through the crisis; we avoided not only the materialisation of inflation risks in normal times but, in these exceptionally difficult times since the intensification of the crisis in 2008, also the materialisation of deflationary risks.[end_answer] I have no particular comment on what the President of the United States said. What I would say is that it was very important to take the appropriate and bold decisions to cope with the private sector crisis, to draw all the lessons from this financial crisis as far as financial regulation is concerned, and to be fully aware of the challenges that the addressing of the financial crisis had for public signatures. We were not at ease with the idea that in the heat of the crisis, all countries were called to spend as much as possible, embark on deficits as much as possible. I believe that the tensions we are observing in Europe today are part of a much more global phenomenon, namely the pressure on the sovereign signatures in the advanced economies. The current tensions on some euro area sovereigns are therefore not only a euro area issue, but also have a European aspect and a global aspect. In comparison with most emerging economies, most advanced economies have to cope with a real challenge as regards their fiscal policies.[end_answer] The position of the Governing Council, which is public, is that we are not taking any decision in this domain. It is first of all for the executive branches to see what they want to do. We are telling them that to embark in a compulsory way of dealing with this issue is not advisable. We are telling them that doing anything that would create a credit event or selective default or default is not advisable. In any case it is their decision, and then we will take all the appropriate decisions ourselves as far as the Eurosystem is concerned, in line with our statutory obligations. But again, we are saying very clearly that they should avoid compulsion, credit event, or selective default or default. Our position is clear.[end_answer] No other comment.[end_answer] No.[end_answer] Correct.[end_answer] It is not a working assumption that anybody considers.[end_answer] We are living in democracies and we have to fully respect their functioning. It calls more than ever to communicate as clearly as possible to our people all the elements on the situation and the economic and financial diagnosis. It is true for all countries, including those in an adjustment programme and those contributing to the financing of these programmes.[end_answer] I mentioned explicitly it would be in a long-term perspective, which calls for changes of the Treaty and which is based on the assumption that, at a certain moment in history, Europeans would decide to create a new kind of confederation of sovereign nations. I said very clearly this is not for today. We know today what we have to do. It would be for the day after tomorrow. For that, we will depend entirely on the people of Europe and on its will.[end_answer] I always said the UK was much welcome in the euro area and that it depended entirely on the will of the UK government and people. It is as simple as that. That being said, even without the UK we are 331m people, the same order of magnitude as the US. Again, the UK is welcome and it depends entirely on the UK to decide. In any case, I am sure that the UK is a European country at the heart of Europe, by all means.[end_answer] What is striking to see is that virtually all countries and economies that had large problems in the past decades drew the lessons from their problems and became much more resilient than the advanced economies in the occasion of the last crisis of 2007-08.[end_answer] For advanced economies now, financial sector reform is so important not only to make this sector much more resilient, but we also have to take into account that it is extremely unlikely that our democracies would put for a second time 27% of GDP of taxpayers risk on the table. It is very likely that the decision-making processes in our democracies would not allow us to avoid another great depression if we had exactly the same kind of challenge.[end_answer] They are paying a high price after a practice of benign neglect. We were preaching in the desert for a long period of time. If I have a message today, it would be to all governments, not only in the euro area, but particularly in the euro area, that they have to take fiscal policy very, very seriously. Not only fiscal policy but also the monitoring of competitive indicators, the monitoring of unit labour costs.[end_answer] I was in France the fervent advocate of what I called with a number of colleagues ‘competitive disinflation’: it was to say that with inflation and successive depreciation of the currency or devaluation countries don’t have a winning strategy but a losing strategy. That was the main message of ‘competitive disinflation’.[end_answer] You have a formidable challenge which is coming from all emerging markets. The crisis reveals a lot of weaknesses in the advanced economies and we all have to accept that and reflect on that. All advanced economies, the US, the euro area, the UK, or the single market of the EU-27, clearly we have a major new challenge, which is to adjust to an important role of China, India, Latin America and all the emerging countries in our global economy.[end_answer] The fact we have to review our business model is obvious. A lot of further attention is warranted to the appropriate flexibility of our economies. Structural reforms are absolutely necessary. Education, science and research & development are key success factors. The progressive diminishing of PhDs in science and technology in the many advanced economies is not a good sign.[end_answer] The growth and catching-up of the emerging world is exactly what we wanted after World War Two. It calls for us to adapt permanently, perhaps more rapidly than we would like.[end_answer] Globalisation is a Janus with a double face. You have on the one hand this formidable challenge of volatile oil and commodities prices. On the other hand you have the formidable disinflationary trend of manufacturing goods, which are produced at lower prices. We have to deal with these simultaneous trends that are very complex and are accelerating changes of relative prices. It is a formidable challenge for all central banks of the world, not only in the advanced economies of course. That is something that I trust central banks can do in the medium term if they are vigilant, if they are attentive. In the very long run, I tend to be optimistic. I was trained as a scientist at the beginning. I trust that we will find technological ways to get rid of this incredible dependency on fossil energy or on the large number of minerals and commodities. It is an absolute must for our world, our environment and our civilisation. I therefore trust that we will deliver.[end_answer] I have no plan. I will see after the end of my mandate. At the present moment I still have close to five months ahead of me and quite a lot of challenges obviously.","['anchor very solidly inflation', 'materialisation of inflation risks', 'materialisation

116,2014-12-17,Interview with Wall Street Journal,Benoît Cœuré,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2014/html/sp141217.en.html,Information not found,,"WSJ: What are the prospects for quantitative easing after the results of the four-year ECB loans to banks and purchases of covered bonds and asset backed securities so far?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: For me the question is not so much whether what we are now implementing works, as the measures that you mentioned were meant to address the environment that we had in the summer. The key issue now is whether the environment is changing to a point where we need to do more. What has changed is the confirmation of low growth and low inflation, and the oil shock which is obviously new.[end_answer] I see a broad consensus around the table in the Governing Council that we need to do more. If we had been in a position to cut rates at the last meeting, we would probably have done so. It’s not that much of a question on whether we should do something, but more a discussion on the best way to do it.[end_answer] WSJ: What other assets should you buy? Government bonds?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: If we want to do more we obviously have to reach out to market segments where there is more liquidity and that is why the government bond market is the baseline option, which doesn't necessarily mean we would only buy government bonds. That’s a discussion we will have in the Governing Council.[end_answer] WSJ: Will you have the information you need by your next policy meeting on Jan. 22?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: I don’t know what the flow of data will show between now and then. Ideally you would need enough time to assess what exactly is the pass-through from lower oil prices to core inflation and to know more about the second-round effects. On the other hand we don’t want to be behind the curve and act too late. I would expect the discussion at the Governing Council to be a balancing act between those considerations.[end_answer] WSJ: How important is a very strong majority on the Council for QE?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: It’s certainly desirable to have as much support as possible when it is about introducing a new instrument. No instrument is perfect. We have to weigh the pros and cons, and understand the unintended consequences. The more Governors standing by this new instrument, the safer you feel that the pros and cons have been weighed in the right way.[end_answer] We need to design a solution in a way that mitigates the concerns of as many people around the table as possible. We have a good precedent with Outright Monetary Transactions. This was a new instrument that raised concerns around the table. We were able to design it the right way because we took concerns on board, and we are now going through exactly the same process.[end_answer] WSJ: What about arguments that QE wouldn’t be effective in the eurozone?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: That’s exactly why we want to discuss the way we design it. We are starting from a different place than the U.S. We need a European solution to a European problem. Moreover, our economy is more bank based which implies that any new instrument would have to complement what we’ve already done. Even if we buy government bonds, that does not suppress the need to buy ABS or covered bonds. It does not suppress the need to do our liquidity operations. It has to be a combination of instruments.[end_answer] WSJ: What is your message to the QE skeptics in Germany and the financial markets?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: The starting point is simple: the ECB has a narrow mandate which is medium-term inflation (of close to but below 2%) and today we are far from this number. We have both a moral and legal responsibility to deliver on our mandate.[end_answer] I absolutely agree that very low sovereign yields weaken the incentives to run sound fiscal policies. The answer is not to ask the ECB to be an agent of the fiscal authorities. That’s not the way the European people have drafted and approved the EU Treaty. The answer is to be as strict as possible in enforcing fiscal rules, and that’s the role of institutions that are not the ECB.[end_answer] WSJ: Inflation was 0.3% in November and is expected to weaken more. Are you behind the curve?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: Our mandate is to bring inflation back closer to 2% over the medium term. Monthly headline inflation can be low provided it does not contaminate longer term inflation expectations. That is what we want to understand today. Headline inflation will be very low, maybe even negative in early 2015. That is mechanical. Is it bad or not? It all depends on the impact on longer term inflation expectations. It has the potential to be net positive only if you can reap the benefits on purchasing power and consumption without de-anchoring longer term inflation expectations.[end_answer] WSJ: Is an inflation rate of 2% even achievable in the eurozone?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: I may be old fashioned, but I still believe that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon, and so the question is more how fast do we go back to 2% and what is the kind of shock that keeps us from 2%. It is also true that in the eurozone we have an environment where markets are more rigid than in the U.S. and U.K. So it is likely that given any particular shock, inflation will take more time to go back to our objective.[end_answer] WSJ: Economic output is still below its 2008 peak in the eurozone. Is there a risk that a Lost Decade turns into a Lost Generation?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: Reforms are working in the periphery. You can see growth in Ireland. You can see unemployment going down in Spain. You can see the economy improving even in Cyprus. All eurozone countries are reforming their economies, but at different paces. It’s all moving in the right direction but it’s frustrating because it’s not fast enough in our view.[end_answer] WSJ: Is it time for the eurozone to be more of a contributor to the global economy, rather than just depending on growth elsewhere through exports?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: I think that there’s certainly a strong case to support domestic demand. As long as eurozone growth generally remains driven by external demand, it’s vulnerable to external shocks. We are living in a risky world. There are geopolitical risks. You cannot count on consumers in other regions to support your well-being. That’s why the discussion on investment and structural reforms is so important.[end_answer] WSJ: Given the divergence in monetary policies among major central banks, will the euro be weaker?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: We don’t have an exchange rate target. The likely course of events over the foreseeable future is interest rates remaining at an extremely low level in Europe and a normalization in other places, including the U.S. The logical market outcome would be for the exchange rate to adjust. I don’t want to pass a judgment on how much it can adjust or how much it should adjust.[end_answer] WSJ: What will the ECB’s meeting minutes look like next year?[end_answer] A: The Governing Council still has to make the final decision. It is likely that the minutes will be substantial. I expect the arguments not to be attributed, but they will give you a sense of the balance of views in the Governing Council. We will decide this week whether we disclose the names for the votes. In terms of substance and granularity they will compare favorably with Fed minutes.[end_answer] WSJ: How long between meetings and the publication of minutes?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: Four weeks. We want to publish the minutes after the second non-monetary policy meeting in case we would need to discuss them, which I don’t expect should usually happen.[end_answer] WSJ: Europe has been heavily criticized in recent years. What are some reasons to be optimistic?[end_answer] Mr. Cœuré: We are a group of highly advanced, rich economies with extremely good human capital and an extremely good capacity to innovate. The question is more how to move on and get rid of the legacy of the crisis, which we haven’t been able to do fast enough, partly because we had to rebuild the house while it was still on fire. We need further discussion on how to complete monetary union to make it more robust, which will in my view require some degree of fiscal union, with appropriate democratic underpinnings. It will be a long discussion, so we’d better start it early.","['low inflation', 'core inflation', 'bring inflation back', 'inflation can be low', 'inflation will be very low', 'de-anchoring longer term inflation', 'inflation is always a monetary phenomenon', 'inflation will take more time to go back']","['What has changed is the confirmation of low growth and low inflation, and the oil shock which is obviously new', 'Ideally you would need enough time to assess what exactly is the pass-through from lower oil prices to core inflation and to know more about the second-round effects', 'Cœuré: Our mandate is to bring inflation back closer to 2% over the medium term', 'Monthly headline inflation can be low provided it does not contaminate longer term inflation expectations', 'Headline inflation will be very low, maybe even negative in early 2015', 'It has the potential to be net positive only if you can reap the benefits on purchasing power and consumption without de-anchoring longer term inflation expectations', 'Cœuré: I may be old fashioned, but I still believe that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon, and so the question is more how fast do we go back to 2% and what is the kind of shock that keeps us from 2%', 'So it is likely that given any particular shock, inflation will take more time to go back to our objective']",1969,M,France,2012 - 2019,"['what have change be the confirmation of low growth and low inflation and the oil shock which be obviously new ', 'ideally you would need enough time to assess what exactly be the passthrough from low oil price to core inflation and to know more about the secondround effect ', 'Cœuré the starting point be simple the ECB have a narrow mandate which be mediumterm inflation of close to but below and today we be far from this number ', 'WSJ inflation be ', 'Cœuré our mandate be to bring inflation back close to over the medium term ', 'monthly headline inflation can be low provide it do not contaminate long term inflation expectation ', 'headline inflation will be very low maybe even negative in early ', 'be it bad or not ? it all depend on the impact on long term inflation expectation ', 'it have the potential to be net positive only if you can reap the benefit on purchase power and consumption without deanchore long term inflation expectation ', 'WSJ be an inflation rate of even achievable in the eurozone ?

129,2014-07-15,Interview with Les Echos,Peter Praet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2014/html/sp140715.en.html,Information not found,"What would be your diagnosis of the health of the euro area?[end_question] Do you think that the economies have stopped diverging?[end_question] SMEs are complaining that they can't get the financing that they need…[end_question] What are the brakes on growth?[end_question] What mechanisms do we need to act on?[end_question] So do you think that the stability pact doesn't actually offer increased flexibility?[end_question] Unlike growth, the inflation figures are not in line with your scenarios.

Are they mistaken?[end_question] So we shouldn't be expecting a genuine QE package?[end_question] When you talk about large-scale asset purchases, which assets do you mean, exactly?[end_question] The new longer-term loans to banks are conditional on them granting credit.

Is this a concern for you?[end_question] A Portuguese bank has triggered turmoil on the European markets. Are the euro area and its banks still a cause for concern despite all the firewalls that have been put in place?","Growth is taking off again, but it's a modest, fragile recovery and the risks are still very present. The latest figures are in line with our official scenario overall. I had hoped that the recovery would be picking up pace, but for the moment, it's not happening. Business is driven more by domestic demand than by exports, which are less robust than before the crisis.[end_answer] It is noticeable that confidence indicators have recovered sharply in the countries most affected by the crisis. This is the case in Spain, particularly, where growth forecasts are going to be revised upwards. In other countries, it is harder to make a diagnosis, particularly in France, where the pace of the recovery is deceptive. France has, however, benefited from very favourable financing conditions throughout the crisis, unlike Italy, for example.[end_answer] It's true that financing conditions have mainly been good for large businesses, which have access to the financial markets (through bond issues). SMEs find it harder to obtain financing during a recession. This is the case in France, as it is elsewhere. The central bank has reacted by cutting rates several times, bringing them to very low levels. The figures show, however, that whereas the lending trend is, on average, negative in the euro area as a whole, it is positive in France.[end_answer] Monetary policy cannot do it all. France has been affected by the slowing growth of its neighbours. But basically, it's investment that is causing a particularly serious problem. Another factor is the relative weakness of its export capacity. In the German press, we read news every day about the success of SMEs in the export markets. In France, the industrial landscape centres around a small number of very large export companies. I think the country has too much of a tendency to wait for the recovery of its commercial partners. Although recent signals have been encouraging, urgent action is required. We are still in a period of balance sheet adjustment, which drags on growth and creates a climate of uncertainty. We need to restore confidence to bring about a recovery in investment, particularly through clear announcements. The finance minister was talking recently about ""good finance"". I would add that good finance can't do anything if the fundamentals are not good.[end_answer] I think that certain reforms should be made a priority in some countries to boost the potential for growth. In Italy, for example, emphasis is placed on the judicial framework to ensure that relationships between creditors and debtors are safeguarded, and on the reform of the Italian Senate, which must improve its decision-making. Equally, measures could be taken in the labour market – as happened two and a half years ago in Spain, where the results can now be seen. The important thing is to honour our commitments. Promised reform is all too often delayed or, sometimes not even implemented at all.[end_answer] The stability pact offers enough flexibility to take the short-term cost of structural reform into consideration. However, we should not go off course to such an extent that we lose credibility.[end_answer] We have had to significantly revise our inflation forecasts for 2014, trimming them from 1.1% to 0.7% since December 2013. Low inflation is no longer caused purely by adjustments in certain euro area countries, and by lower energy and food prices. Normally, a fall in prices would be able to support purchasing power and, therefore, domestic demand. But demand has remained weak, including in the biggest euro area economies.[end_answer] With rates of inflation that are too low month after month, our comfort zone for reaching the target of price inflation close to 2% over the medium term has shrunk. Faced with this risk, we were obliged to act as we did in June.[end_answer] Medium-term expectations remain well anchored. And if you were to ask me about the probability of a deflationary scenario becoming a reality, my response would be that there is very little risk of this happening in the euro area. Nonetheless, the risks of a prolonged period of low inflation have been identified by the ECB. This has led us to adapt our communication, which is based on the intention to keep rates low for a prolonged period.[end_answer] Our new long-term liquidity lending (TLTRO) programme, which will be launched in September, will in particular enable banks to address their major bond refinancing needs. As a result, the banks will not only be encouraged to lend more and at more favourable conditions, but they will raise less funding on the markets. This liquidity will be returned to investors, which they can use to buy other assets.[end_answer] Last month we launched a package of measures that will be activated in September and December before being renewed on a quarterly basis. Barring any new circumstances, we need to take time to measure the effects.[end_answer] To be really effective, bearing in mind the limited size of the private capital market in Europe, this type of programme is likely to include mainly government bonds.[end_answer] They could do it to invest their liquidity on a temporary basis before finding a permanent home for it. The banks are aware that it is not wise to be over-exposed to sovereign debt. The link between banks and governments, which is what prompted the sovereign debt crisis, is now monitored very closely.[end_answer] We have noticed that following the new measures, a persistent rising trend has been halted. We are confident that when the new measures are implemented, they will underpin an accommodative monetary policy. The euro area needs such a policy – unlike other major currency areas, which are at a completely different phase of the economic cycle. And this rebalancing is likely to be reflected, over time, in the external value of the euro.[end_answer] The banking union that the European Central Bank is actively preparing for will boost confidence in the euro area’s banks.","['low inflation', 'inflation that are too low', 'target of price inflation', 'low inflation']","['Low inflation is no longer caused purely by adjustments in

133,2014-06-21,Interview with Telegraaf,Mario Draghi,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2014/html/sp140621.en.html,Information not found,"Minister Dijsselbloem said recently that the crisis was over. What is your view?[end_question] You would thus define a recovery as any growth above zero?[end_question] The troubles in Iraq are causing oil prices to surge. How much of a risk is that?[end_question] At least if the winter is not too mild, since that cost the Netherlands quite a bit in terms of gas sales at the beginning of the year.[end_question] Compared with the United Kingdom and the United States, economic activity in Europe is still rather weak.[end_question] And all three occurred at one and the same time?[end_question] Does the fact play a role that debt weighs more heavily when inflation is low?[end_question] Private and public sector debt?[end_question] Low interest rates are detrimental for savers, and for people’s pensions. How would you answer such concern?[end_question] How long will interest rates continue to remain low?[end_question] If the United States were already to raise interest rates in spring 2015, would Europe have to wait until spring 2017?[end_question] In view of the impairment of pension entitlements, people are spending less because they have to set more aside.[end_question] Do you have any understanding for the fact that people in the north feel that they are having to pay for the mistakes made by the south?[end_question] Because the United States is a political union.[end_question] Will Greece ever be able to repay its debt?[end_question] The ECB has taken many measures, but has not undertaken any quantitative easing, i.e. has not purchased bonds. What needs to happen before you would start doing so?[end_question] Is it legally possible to buy up government bonds? There is still a court case pending on this issue.[end_question] You were very happy about the unanimity of the decision taken on 5 June. Would a unanimous decision also be possible on quantitative easing?[end_question] Your statement ‘whatever it takes’, to save the euro at any cost, made at the time of the announcement of a new government bond purchasing programme, marks a turning point in the euro crisis. Do you feel that you no longer need to follow through on it?[end_question] Did you ever fear that that might happen?[end_question] Are the OMTs some kind of nuclear bomb, a threat that will never be carried out?[end_question] Were you surprised by this effect?[end_question] Or were you relieved that you had merely had to promise action without following through with it?[end_question] The other side to the coin is that you bought so much time for politicians that they no longer needed to implement reforms so rapidly. Do you also see this other side?[end_question] You have said repeatedly that the euro is an irreversible project. It is understandable that you say that, but is this not something for politicians to decide?[end_question] You saved the euro. In doing so, did you not take a political decision?[end_question] Much has been undertaken to close the gaps in Economic and Monetary Union, stricter budget rules and a banking union. Is everything now in place?[end_question] Current economic policy coordination in the euro area is merely a first step?[end_question] What will the second step look like?[end_question] The contention of some politicians that EMU is complete is thus not correct?[end_question] Is a budgetary authority necessary at the euro area level, a fund for the compensation of weak countries?[end_question] Returning to your example of the State of Oklahoma, would that not be a form of financial solidarity that is needed in the euro area?[end_question] Do you understand the concerns about such a transfer of powers? The outcome of the European elections can also be viewed against that background. Do you have a solution to this issue?[end_question] Do you understand that people see the euro as the cause of the crisis, and of unemployment?[end_question] That sounds terrific, but the many EU Summits on growth and job creation have all led to nothing. What needs to be done?","When Mario Draghi took over as President of the European Central Bank in November 2011, he stepped into the eye of the hurricane. The euro area was confronted with serious problems. After the financial misery in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, larger countries like Spain and Italy were also threatening to collapse. Panic was widespread, both among politicians and among investors.[end_answer] As of his very first day in office as the President of the central bank, the Italian had to take crisis measures. The most serious concerns are a thing of the past, but Europe is still experiencing economic woes. Draghi remains outwardly calm despite the turbulence he has had to deal with. Did he ever have doubts about taking on the job? “No, no, I never hesitated. Things happen.”[end_answer] Mario Draghi is 66 years old and has a further five and a half years ahead of him in Frankfurt. He met the reporters of De Telegraaf for an exclusive interview on the 35th floor of the ECB tower. In the near future, he will be moving to gleaming new premises, but at the moment he is still surrounded by what his predecessors Jean-Claude Trichet and Wim Duisenberg have left him. “Only the books are different – they are mine.”[end_answer] He is happy to take up the Dutch debate on the euro. He doesn’t think much of politicians who promise the earth outside the single European currency. “Some people think we should move back in time, thirty or forty years back. I prefer to go forward.” And that also means to continue to build up Monetary Union because it has by no means been completed.[end_answer] “The recovery has now been ongoing for around nine months. It is still weak and unevenly distributed across the euro area. And it is vulnerable. Accidents could happen in the global economy that can quickly change the situation. That might be a disruption on the financial markets, or geopolitical risks. In addition, unemployment has now been stabilising for some six months. Very slowly it has been going down. Also in crisis countries such as Portugal. But the level of unemployment is still very high. That alone poses a risk to the recovery because it leads to lower consumer demand.”[end_answer] “No, but economic activity is gradually, though slowly, picking up. Both manufacturers’ and consumers’ confidence has been quite good in recent times. However, in the first quarter of this year we saw slower growth.”[end_answer] “Our mandate is to ensure price stability. If inflation in the medium term is higher than the target of close to, but below, 2%, we are concerned. But we are also concerned if it is far lower. We are constantly asking ourselves why inflation is so low in the euro area. Initially, this was due to lower energy and food prices. Later, US dollar prices of these products stabilised, but the euro appreciated, causing inflation to fall still further. Higher oil prices are sure to have an impact on inflation, at least if we do not experience a further appreciation of the euro. But it is also good news for the countries that produce energy, as in the case of the Netherlands with its gas.”[end_answer] “Yes, indeed. Is it not remarkable that the significant fall in economic activity in the Netherlands in the first quarter was due primarily to this fact? Many people simply don’t realise just how large the energy sector is. Incidentally, one has to acknowledge that too low inflation, while being generally negative for growth and especially so in the euro area, does support real disposable incomes. That is one of the reasons why consumption in the euro area is rising.[end_answer] “Our recovery is in an earlier stage that that in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. That is why the ECB adopted a number of policy measures on 5 June: a lower interest rate (and for banks a negative deposit rate), the introduction of support for banks that is linked to the provision of credit, the so-called TLTROs and preparations for a programme for purchases of packaged corporate loans, asset-backed securities. In April, I already said in Amsterdam that there are three situations that could induce the ECB to take action. One was an unwarranted tightening of the monetary policy stance that is reflected in an increase in short-term interest rates. That could lead to higher medium-term interest rates, and thus also impact economic growth and price stability. The second was an ongoing deterioration of lending. That was also a matter for our attention because lending has now been weak for a very long time. The third development was a deterioration of the prospects for price stability over the medium term.”[end_answer] “No, we responded primarily to the first two. We have not seen any deflation in the sense of prices declining across the whole spectrum in the euro area, with households and firms postponing consumption and investment because they are waiting for lower prices. What we do see is that low inflation persists for a long time. If it lasts too long, adjustment in the crisis countries is made more difficult. In a situation of low inflation, wages in these countries need to really decline in absolute terms in order to improve their competitiveness.”[end_answer] “Certainly, that is yet another consequence of low inflation. The reduction of debt levels, which is of great importance in large parts of the euro area, becomes more difficult in the event of low inflation.”[end_answer] “Yes, both private and public debt.”[end_answer] “It is a very understandable concern. Many life insurance policies and pension plans promised far higher value at the time they were agreed.”[end_answer] “We have prolonged banks’ access to unlimited liquidity up to the end of 2016. That is a signal. Our programme in support of bank lending to businesses will continue for four years. That shows that interest rates will remain low over a longer period. But thereafter they will increase when the recovery will firm up.”[end_answer] “We will have to wait and see what happens, but the extension to the end of 2016 is a signal. Incidentally, the United States has reduced the growth figure for the first quarter.”[end_answer] “We do not see this. There is no lack of spending in the countries that are affected most by the low interest rates. I understand the concerns about the low interest rates, but on the other hand, they are what leads to more investment and higher growth. And we need to take into account precisely which interest rate we are talking about. These pension products invest in government bonds with long maturities. Many of the reasons why interest rates on government bonds are low have nothing to do with the ECB. They are low because countries such as the Netherlands and Germany have become safe havens. Prior to the crisis, life insurers invested in bonds issued by all countries, both “core” countries and ‘non-core’ countries. The interest earned on their investment was thus higher because weaker countries had also been included. The crisis created financial fragmentation in that insurers all used government bonds issued by their own countries to fulfil obligations. That caused insurers in the north to be confronted with low yields. Returns in the south were particularly good. Once there is renewed confidence in the euro area, the northern countries will no longer be the only safe havens. Money will then again flow freely and the recovery of confidence will lead to higher yields in the northern countries. Besides that, we have to conduct monetary policy for the whole euro area. We cannot consider only one single point of interest.”[end_answer] “I am well aware of this conflict. Some months ago, I held a lecture on Monetary Union in the United States. I said then that there were major imbalances between various euro area countries, large debtor and large creditor countries. I said that it was never a goal of Monetary Union to create permanent creditors and permanent debtors. That would have to change in order to have a balanced Union. An American in the audience responded to this by saying ‘what you are saying does not hold water because here in the United States, the State of Oklahoma has always been a debtor, while New York has always been a creditor, and that is no cause for us to worry. So why should you be worried about it?’ I think that this touches on the heart of the matter. The debts of US citizens are all treated equally, irrespective of where they come from.”[end_answer] “Indeed. The Dutch have a problem with paying for the Greeks, but not with paying for other Dutch. But let’s look at that ‘paying’. It is not at all clear what some countries have really paid for other countries. In Greece, there was a write-off on debts held by the financial sector, but there was no further default. It has cost the euro area countries far more to save their own banks.”[end_answer] “If Greece continues with its structural reforms, restores order to its public finances and improves its competitiveness, growth there will increase. If that happens, Greece will be able to do so. Greece has less debt to service over the next five years than Belgium. Much of Greek debt has a very low interest rate and very long maturities.”[end_answer] “That would be the answer to the third situation that I mentioned in Amsterdam, a deterioration of inflation expectations over the medium term. At the moment, however, we are focusing on the measures announced on 5 June.”[end_answer] “This is indeed possible within our mandate, namely if the purchases are aimed at ensuring price stability. We are not permitted to provide Member States with monetary financing.”[end_answer] “Any guess would be premature. Quantitative easing can include not only government bonds, but also private sector loans. We will discuss that when the time comes.”[end_answer] (Smiles) “In contrast to both the initial purchases of government bonds and possible quantitative easing, the programme of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) is aimed at a very specific risk, namely the so-called tail risk of the euro area falling apart.”[end_answer] “In July 2012, there were more than enough reasons for concern. In my short statement in London, I said that one of the mistakes many people make is to underestimate how much political capital has already been invested in the euro. I was very much aware of that fact. Just before I made that statement, the political leaders had fully committed themselves to the euro at the European Summit, within the scope of which the Banking Union was created.”[end_answer] “The markets reacted in a way that made it unnecessary to use the programme. The spreads between the interest rates [on bonds] of southern euro area countries and Germany narrowed sharply. That was something that could not have been achieved by any other monetary policy measure.”[end_answer] “By the magnitude of the effect? Yes, certainly. We were all surprised.”[end_answer] “In order to be credible, we also had to be sure that we could actually use the instrument. We were not bluffing, most certainly not.”[end_answer] “Yes and no. We have a mandate to safeguard price stability. We are not responsible for how politicians make use of the time they have. I do not want to mix the responsibilities of the central bank with those of governments. But look at the extent of the reforms undertaken by governments since 2012. You will then need to admit that considerable progress has been made. Take Spain, for example, which has restructured its banking sector and reformed the labour market. Portugal is another example and Ireland yet another. And even in Greece progress has been remarkable.”[end_answer] “Our mandate is to ensure price stability. There was more than enough evidence that a collapse of the euro would endanger price stability, and therefore our action was squarely within our mandate.[end_answer] “No, certainly not. The issue is by no means political. My statement in July 2012 was aimed at price stability. There was unjustified uncertainty about the future of the euro, not political uncertainty but a financial one. Unjustified speculative expectations about a break-up of the euro had been selffulfilling in a vicious spiral for several months. They had produced a very high level of interest rates. These rates were harming the real economy and the banking sector. The consequence might have been a new credit crisis and the impairment of our monetary policy, and therefore of our ability to maintain price stability. There has far too often been criticism that it was a political decision, but that is simply not true.”[end_answer] “The banking union is a major step forward in the direction of a more complete monetary union. The crisis has shown that the economic policies of one country have a clear impact on other countries. Economic policy cannot be a purely national matter. Where fiscal policy is concerned, a certain degree of Union-wide discipline is already given. But the marked imbalances between euro area countries are due to a lack of structural reforms in some countries. The next step to be taken is to subject structural reforms, too, to Union-wide discipline.”[end_answer] “Yes, indeed, it is merely a first step.”[end_answer] “That is a matter for the political domain to decide. In the case of the budget agreements, sovereignty has been shared among Member States. That should also be done with respect to the labour market, competitiveness, bureaucracy, agreements on the internal market. Sovereignty needs to be shared at a level other than the national sphere. That is where I stop. Because now there are several options for politicians to choose from. You could grant greater powers to the European Commission, or to the Member States within the European Council, or you could create new European institutions. That is not for me to decide.”[end_answer] “No, far more is necessary for a perfect monetary union.”[end_answer] “That is a highly political issue. Compliance with existing rules would be enough. But it is clear that my predecessor in office, Trichet, made a strong case for a budgetary authority.”[end_answer] “There is at least one difference. The United States is a single country, the euro area is not. Given the more complex structure, we must seek a design that best ensures that economic policy is regarded as being of common interest.”[end_answer] “Are we really so sure that it would have been better if we all still had our own currency? Would we have been better off over the past ten, fifteen years? In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, we experienced a whole number of currency devaluations with often high inflation as a result. We currently have a formidable degree of price stability, a low rate of inflation. That offers enormous opportunities for growth and job creation. It is not the fault of the euro that economic policy went wrong in some countries. But let us please conduct that debate. It is important as such. Some people feel that we should turn time back thirty or forty years, but I prefer to move forward.”[end_answer] “The crisis and the unemployment are the result of a very severe financial crisis and partly also of wrong economic policies. The euro may have masked it but it has not caused it. We must end the crisis in Monetary Union and enable it to create prosperity and jobs again.”[end_answer] “That is a complicated issue. We cannot accept the present because we currently have low growth and insufficient job creation. On the other hand, we should not dream of a past that cannot be brought back and that cannot by any means be clearly taken to be better. We must work for the future in order to achieve not only stability, but also growth and employment.”","['inflation in the medium term is higher', 'inflation is so low', 'inflation to fall', 'impact on

136,2014-04-22,Interview with Le Monde,Benoît Cœuré,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2014/html/sp140422.en.html,Information not found,"Is the level of government debt in the euro area sustainable?[end_question] The measures required of countries subject to a financial assistance programme under the Troika have had a recessionary impact stronger than that forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), particularly in Greece. Have we gone too far with austerity?[end_question] Is the current level of the euro too high?[end_question] The low inflation observed in the euro area is affecting all advanced economies. What is behind this?[end_question] What could the ECB do to influence the level of the euro?[end_question] Would such quantitative easing affect purchases of government or private debt?[end_question] Would it be advantageous for the euro area to develop market financing of the economy, like in the United States?[end_question] With this in mind, the ECB and the Bank of England are suggesting to revise the European rules on ABS. How?[end_question] Might the normalisation of US monetary policy push European interest rates up?[end_question] Spanish, Greek and Italian sovereign rates have declined strongly in recent weeks although these Member States still have high public debt. Are the markets too optimistic?[end_question] France has just announced 50 billion euro worth of savings and is slow to implement reforms. Is France lagging behind?[end_question] The ECB has begun assessing banks’ balance sheets before the start of Banking Union. Could the discovery of weaknesses in large institutions trigger another crisis?[end_question] With the banking union, the ECB will be responsible for banking supervision in addition to monetary policy. Is that not too many powers in the hands of one sole institution?[end_question] How will the ECB stand up to any political pressure in this regard?","The euro area countries have already greatly reduced their deficits. Now that growth is returning, continued efforts in this regard will allow debt-to-GDP ratios to be reduced.[end_answer] The financial assistance provided by the European Union and the IMF gave these countries time to change the course of economic and financial trends that were no longer sustainable. Remember that had no financial assistance been provided, the adjustment would have been much more abrupt. The need for restraint is now lessening in the euro area, but not because debt is back in fashion! It is down to the fact that most countries have already taken the toughest measures and are now starting to reap the benefits.[end_answer] There is a particular fascination with the exchange rate in France that is not shared by other euro area countries. No doubt this has something to do with the fact that France is one of the only countries in the euro area whose external accounts are in the red. However, the euro area as a whole is running a current account surplus: the solution for France, therefore, is to improve its competitiveness, which is indeed what the government plans to do. This is not to say that the ECB is not concerned about the exchange rate; it is rather that the ECB does not have an exchange rate objective. The exchange rate is one of the factors that we take into account in deciding on our monetary policy stance. The important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below, but close to, 2%, which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate.[end_answer] There is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation. All other things being equal, the stronger the euro, the more an accommodative monetary policy is justified.[end_answer] There is no simple answer to this question. Several factors are at play. Let’s start with the difficult situation observed on the labour markets in most industrialised countries. The unemployment rate remains very high in the euro area. If this figure is lower for the United States, it is because many Americans have withdrawn from the labour market.[end_answer] To this must be added the deleveraging by households and businesses, which is weighing on consumption and investment, and other factors, such as the slowing of China’s economy, which is having a dampening effect on energy commodity and food prices, as well as the decline in energy prices, which is linked in part to the exploitation of shale gas in the United States. We need to know whether these developments are sustainable. All the major central banks, and not just the ECB, are asking themselves this question.[end_answer] We have several instruments at our disposal in the event that it becomes necessary to loosen our monetary policy stance. We still have some margin to reduce key interest rates, including by pushing the deposit rate into negative territory (which remunerates the banks for funds held in the ECB’s overnight deposit facility). Finally, at its last meeting, the Governing Council declared itself unanimously ready to look into non-standard measures, including the possibility of quantitative easing (QE) if circumstances dictated.[end_answer] If implemented, this instrument is expected to have an impact on a range of assets that is broad enough to inject sufficient liquidity into the economy. The ECB’s choice as to whether it should then repurchase public or private assets would depend on three factors. First, it is a question of effectiveness, in order to ensure the smooth transmission of the measures taken to the real economy, and in particular loans to businesses. Second, it is an issue of feasibility. The financial markets in Europe are very different to those in the United States: a QE for the euro area would thus be very unlike the US version of QE. Lastly, purchases of assets should be carried out in line with the Treaty, which prohibits the ECB from directly financing governments. Discussions are underway on all of these aspects.[end_answer] I should add that any monetary measure will only be effective if banks in the euro area are able to start loaning to businesses again, and notably to small and medium-sized enterprises. The assessment of banks’ balance sheets that the ECB is undertaking this year is key in this regard: if it is perceived as being sufficiently strict and objective, it will foster renewed confidence in the banking sector.[end_answer] Yes, even if the idea is not to copy the United States. European growth is based almost exclusively on financing of households and firms by banks. For a long time that worked well, European banks did their job. But the 2007 global crisis and then the euro area crisis revealed that depending so exclusively on one sole method of financing constitutes a weakness.[end_answer] Developing market financing via ABS, i.e. asset-backed securities (secured corporate debt) or, for example, bond issuance by medium-sized enterprises would make the financial system more balanced and more resistant to shocks. This is essential as, by definition, we do not know where the next crisis will hit.[end_answer] The European regulators are discussing this because the euro area needs these instruments. It’s a medium-term project whose purpose must not in any circumstances be to recreate the securities market as it existed before the crisis. The “new ABS” must be different from the previous ones. If they are more transparent and simpler then they will be less risky – the rules could take this lower degree of risk into account, in particular for the capital requirements applying to banks and insurance companies. It’s not a question of going back over the need to raise the moral standards of finance, which has been advocated since 2008, but to promote instruments that finance the economy.[end_answer] It should be remembered, first, that if the US Federal Reserve System has decided to gradually taper its asset purchases in the markets, it is because it considers that the US economy is improving and that the recovery is sound. That’s good news for the global economy.[end_answer] Recovery in the euro area is behind compared with the United States. We are therefore working to ensure that this differentiated recovery does not harm monetary conditions in the euro area. The ECB’s adoption of “forward guidance” on its monetary policy has enabled European short-term interest rates to be disconnected efficiently from US short-term interest rates. We will ensure that this continues.[end_answer] No, on condition that the reforms continue. International investors have confidence in the reform dynamic in euro area Member States, including in Greece. The level of the rates is only justified if the reforms are carried out as planned. This is true in small Member States just as in the big ones.[end_answer] France has not been under the same pressures or financial stress as the peripheral countries of the euro area. France has enjoyed investor goodwill and has been fortunate to be able to decide for itself on the rhythm of its reforms. But that does not mean that the reforms are any less necessary.[end_answer] At this stage it is too early to say what we will find. But one thing is certain: for confidence in the banking system to be restored, each time a bank has insufficient capital reserves, the gap will need to be filled quickly. And this following a well-defined procedure: first, having recourse to the bank’s internal resources, then markets and finally – and only in the event that this is not enough – to public authorities at national or European level in compliance with State aid rules. Governments in the euro area have for that matter undertaken to follow this procedure if the situation requires it.[end_answer] It is true that the ECB will have more powers. But, as in any democratic system, it will have strong counterparts. In banking supervision just as in monetary policy, the ECB will be accountable for its decisions in accordance with the procedures which have been agreed with the European Parliament.[end_answer] The ECB has already demonstrated its ability to withstand pressure. Indeed, it is not only a question of being independent of governments but also of financial lobbies.","['inflation rates to below', 'low level of inflation']","['The important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below, but close to, 2%, which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate', 'There is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation']",1969,M,France,2012 - 2019,"['the important thing for we be to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook be likely to hinder the return of inflation rate to below but close to which be our definition of price stability and which lie at the heart of our mandate ', 'there be no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of have contribute to the current low level of inflation ']","['the important thing for we be to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook be likely to hinder the return of inflation rate to below but close to which be our definition of price stability and which lie at the heart of our mandate ', 'there be no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of have contribute to the current low level of inflation ']",2,2,8435,[],0,"['The important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below but close to 2 which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate.', 'There is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation.']",2,2,"['the important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below but close to 2 which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate', 'there is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation']","['orientation', 'orientation']","[True, True]",[],[],0,"['orientation', 'orientation']",2,2,"['the important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below but close to 2 which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate', 'there is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation']","['orientation', 'orientation']","['the important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below but close to 2 which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate', 'there is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation']","['orientation', 'orientation']","['the important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below but close to 2 which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate', 'there is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation']","['orientation', 'orientation']","['orientation', 'orientation']","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]"
138,2014-03-11,Interview with the Wall Street Journal,Sabine Lautenschläger,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2014/html/sp140311.en.html,Information not found,"WSJ: The financial markets interpreted Thursday's ECB decision to keep policy unchanged as suggesting the bar is high to additional stimulus. Is that an accurate assessment?[end_question] WSJ: But inflation is way below the ECB's target.[end_question] WSJ: The U.S. central bank has reacted more aggressively to disinflation risks. Is the ECB being complacent? Even by your own forecasts inflation will only be 1.7% by the end of 2016.[end_question] WSJ: Mario Draghi mentioned Thursday a catalogue of options including facilitating the ABS market, funding for lending and quantitative easing.[end_question] WSJ: What can the ECB do?[end_question] WSJ: What about using collateral rules from the ECB or going out and buying ABS to get that market going?[end_question] WSJ: Analysts say the ABS market can’t get the start it needs in Europe unless the ECB buys them.[end_question] WSJ: Is there more room on interest rates? The refinancing rate is 0.25% and deposit rate is zero.[end_question] WSJ: What about quantitative easing? Is that a legitimate tool?[end_question] WSJ: Your predecessor, Joerg Asmussen, favored the OMT. The institution you worked for until a couple months ago, the Bundesbank, vigorously opposed it. What's your position?[end_question] WSJ: How important is it that monetary policy decisions are not influenced by the state of the banking system?[end_question] WSJ: Does there need to be a response from the European Union to the Federal Reserve’s new rules for international banks?[end_question] WSJ: Isn’t the asset quality review process for euro-zone banks too late? The U.S. addressed problems with its banks several years ago.[end_question] WSJ: Do you think a lot of banks will fail as a result of the AQR and the stress test?[end_question] WSJ: There is a perception that the Bundesbank and the ECB are constantly in conflict. You have been at the Bundesbank. You are now at the ECB. What’s your experience?[end_question] WSJ: You are the only woman on the ECB Governing Council. Why haven’t women been more represented on the ECB board and do you see that changing?","The correct interpretation is: We'll act if it is necessary. But there was no strong reason to act: Last week we, the Governing Council, found our baseline scenario broadly confirmed. We're receiving some positive signals from incoming data, for example economically with a modest recovery trend and financially with improving funding conditions for banks. Moreover, inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term.[end_answer] When assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons. There are some global factors to take into account. The drop in energy prices has a very strong impact, for example. Structural reforms that are being implemented in member states of the euro area influence prices too. The output gap we acknowledge by our forward guidance: Interest rates will remain at the present level, or even lower, over a longer period of time and well into the recovery.[end_answer] I reject it if someone says we are complacent. We will act should we observe rising concerns about medium-term price stability. And we were not complacent in the past. We used standard and non-standard measures to implement a very accommodative monetary policy stance. We not only cut rates and moved to a fix rate full allotment mode but also introduced LTROs and changed the collateral requirements, so that a wider range of assets became acceptable in our portfolio.[end_answer] Beyond that, I don't think you should compare the situation in the euro area with the U.S. or Japan because the underlying factors are different.[end_answer] We really need to work on the ABS case. Going back to 2010, the decision taken by the Basel Committee to strengthen capital requirements for asset backed securities was the correct one. But I would like to go back and see if the decision had unintended consequences with respect to the market of transparent, simple, so called plain vanilla ABS. We could check whether the capital requirements are justified or too high.[end_answer] We can talk to the people in different international regulatory committees such as the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board and ask them to revisit the issue. I plan to do that.[end_answer] One can only address problems with well-defined, targeted measures. Which measure is appropriate very much depends on the concrete circumstances. Acting just for the sake of acting makes no sense. In any case, it would be necessary to ensure that, with respect to our risk management framework, we do have the necessary protection.[end_answer] I don’t think so. It all depends on the costs: the capital costs connected to simple, plain vanilla ABS. Should the banks’ costs for these instruments decrease after a fair and strict review of the capital requirements by the international standard setter, the ABS market could be revived and lending supported. When the regulatory cost goes down, they will be bought.[end_answer] Yes, we have room left to act. The deposit rate could be negative, for example. That's at least a possibility depending on whether the underlying factors we observe would call for this sort of measure. Different instrument are available to us. They include, for example, the suspension of the sterilization of the Securities Market Program or an LTRO with a more targeted approach. You could think about the collateral framework, too.[end_answer] It depends on the conditions around it. For example: guarantees, etc.[end_answer] Without knowing the future concrete circumstances underlying a decision on the potential activation of the OMT, it is difficult to answer this question. Overall I am a little bit critical about the incentives structure offered by the OMT. I do see some legal questions coming up. But to get the concrete answers on those questions you need concrete circumstances: the economic conditions; what you buy; how much you buy, mitigating factors like the conditionality etc.[end_answer] What is important is that you have to make sure that the decisions in the banking supervisory arm are not influenced by your monetary policy task and vice versa, and that you can do. But you cannot have a Chinese wall in your head. As a central banker, you should be very well familiar with what is happening to banks within in the euro area, after all they constitute one of the biggest monetary policy transmission channels. But rest assured we will implement strict rules and practices to ensure separation between both tasks. Currently, we are examining best practices of other central banks around the world, which are also tasked with banking supervision. The decision making procedure for supervisory decision is a very special one: The Supervisory Board of the SSM will draft the decision and the Governing Council, the ultimate decision making body, adopts it through a non-objection procedure.[end_answer] We have an agreement between the U.S. and Europe that there is a certain kind of reciprocity in accepting the regulatory regime as equal. The next half year should be a period where we ask our colleagues from the Fed, how they want to implement the new foreign bank rules. And then we need to talk in the European arena how we want to react in particular when we are talking about reciprocity.[end_answer] No, it is not too late. The AQR and the stress test will be tough. They will be credible, stringent and consistent. It’s the last chance to clean up. We are a little bit late, but then again, the situation in the U.S. was a different one. The U.S. banks had many problems in the beginning, in 2008, because of the huge amount of toxic assets on their balance sheets. The problems some European banks had to face, the perceptions we are fighting against, are stemming from 2008 and from the sovereign crisis of 2012.[end_answer] Shall we define fail? Fail means for me not to meet the targets of 5.5% capital in the adverse scenario or the 8% on the baseline scenario of the stress test. Well, I think there will be some banks, which will need to improve their capital situation. I won’t tell you a number because I do not know a number. But what is the objective of the exercise? It is to boost confidence. If we do this correctly and confidence in the system improves, then I am pretty sure that these banks will not have many problems to improve their capital situation.[end_answer] There are sometimes different opinions, quite normal when important topics with a lot of consequences are discussed. And journalists do not like to write about decision taken in agreement. And I do remember many instances where Bundesbank was supportive of measures taken by the Eurosystem.[end_answer] Well, there were 24 men and now there are 23 men and one woman, so it has changed. I think central banking in Europe is an area where women have been underrepresented, that was certainly the case in the 1970s. And even though today there are more women, it will take several years to get them to the top.","['inflation expectations are still firmly anchored', 'inflation comes']","['Moreover, inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term', 'When assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons']",1964,F,Germany,2014 - 2019,"['moreover inflation expectation be still firmly anchor in the medium term ', 'when assess the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reason ']","['moreover inflation expectation be still firmly anchor in the medium term ', 'when assess the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reason ']",2,2,6989,[],0,"['Moreover inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term.', 'When assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons.']",2,2,"['moreover inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term', 'when assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons']","['other', 'other']","[True, True]",[],[],0,"['machine', 'orientation']",2,2,"['moreover inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term', 'when assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons']","['orientation', 'other']","['moreover inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term', 'when assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons']","['orientation', 'other']","['moreover inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term', 'when assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons']","['orientation', 'other']","['orientation', 'other']","[True, True]","[True, False]","[True, True]","[True, False]","[True, True]","[True, False]","[True, True]","[True, False]","[True, True]","[True, False]","[True, True]","[True, False]","[True, True]","[True, False]","[True, True]","[True, False]"
149,2015-11-15,Interview with Les Echos,Yves Mersch,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2015/html/sp151115.en.html,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Philippe Lacour, published on 15 November 2015","Les Echos – What is your reaction to the terror attacks?[end_question] Before being able to measure the consequences of these events, what is your diagnostic of the euro area economy?[end_question] The Autumn 2015 European Economic Forecast also points to a divergence between the two large economies, France and Germany. Is it worrying to see that economic integration is not progressing in the euro area?[end_question] Rather than cooperation, Europe is showing divisions and tensions. With respect to Greece, where the situation with creditors is becoming more strained, should we be worried that the crisis experienced in the middle of the year will flare up again? How would the ECB react?[end_question] Portugal, for its part, has plunged into a political crisis following the ousting of the pro-austerity government. Could it become a new Greece?[end_question] Is France going far enough when it comes to reforms?[end_question] Is the situation in the euro area fragile enough to justify new measures by the ECB?[end_question] That work is currently being done by several committees made up of representatives of the national central banks and of the ECB.[end_question] Several central bank governors have spoken in favour of the adoption of new measures.[end_question] It is conceivable that one of the recommendations for supporting growth and inflation would be to expand the asset purchase programme launched in March, in other words, QE – a measure which can by nature be extended. However, it seems that the Governing Council is divided on the subject...[end_question] And what do you recommend?[end_question] The other option referred to in Malta concerns a lowering of the Eurosystem deposit facility rate. The negative rate of -0.20%, in place since 2014, was supposed to be a floor. Why should the ECB change its mind?[end_question] It is highly likely that the US Federal Reserve System will increase its rates in December. That possibility has already affected the euro-dollar exchange rate. Could that exempt the ECB from taking action?[end_question] European banking supervision, under the authority of the ECB, has got off to a good start. All that remains to be put in place to complete banking union is a European deposit guarantee scheme. Does Germany's opposition to the plan worry you","Yves Mersch – We are deeply shocked by what happened in Paris. Those atrocious attacks have killed and wounded hundreds of people. We express our solidarity, our compassion, and our sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims.[end_answer] Recovery in the euro area is ongoing, growth is showing a definite resilience. Domestic demand is supported by consumption thanks to the low price of oil, which increases purchasing power. But the other facet of demand, investment, is not at its best level. This is the case for public investment, especially in countries with room for manoeuvre, while private investment is being held back by the restructuring of balance sheets. The emerging economies are also having an impact on external demand. Inflation is expected to rise again at the beginning of next year owing to base effects on energy prices. However, analysts shouldn't focus so much on short-term data or on certain inflation expectations indices. Our approach is more holistic. We also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures, such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for price-setting, etc.[end_answer] Yes, because in a monetary union, differences between countries shouldn't be such as to render monetary policy less effective. Economic structures may differ, but it would be better if economic cycles would converge. That is why we hope that economic cooperation in Europe will be strengthened.[end_answer] We have asked Greece to adopt a large number of measures in a very short time. It appears that the Greek government is still finding it hard to implement the agreed programme. The Ministers of Finance of the euro area are confident that the commitments made will be honoured; they are convinced that the necessary measures will be taken in order to release the pledged funds. The ECB does not take a political stance on the matter. It follows rules which are transparent and public.[end_answer] Those two countries can't be compared. Each has its own experiences. At the ECB, we respect all existing governments, as long as they implement the commitments they have made on behalf of their countries. That applies to Portugal and to all the other euro area countries.[end_answer] France is committed to implementing reforms, although I must say that the laws which have passed through parliament are often somewhat removed from what was originally announced. The Macron reforms, for example, concern a much lower number of professions than initially envisaged. It's noteworthy that other European countries which are also on the path to economic reform, such as Italy, are implementing institutional reforms in parallel with structural reform.[end_answer] We are waiting to see the outlook for 2017 in the updated Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. At the last meeting in October, the Governing Council of the ECB agreed on the need to re-examine, in December, the degree of monetary policy accommodation. We will examine the effects of measures taken so far and decide if there is a need for further action or not. The discussion will be very detailed, and it is important that proper preparations are made.[end_answer] Those experts are studying all the options. It is possible that their work could lead to recommendations being made. However, the Governing Council is independent and has sole authority.[end_answer] Of course, but nothing has been decided on! The discussion will take place within the Governing Council, not in the public arena.[end_answer] The debate is ongoing. Nothing has been decided yet.[end_answer] We have not exhausted our options. QE is expected to continue until September 2016, at least. Our monetary policy is medium-term oriented. We are already taking stock of what has been done so far and what remains to be done. And we are making decisions for the future based on the marginal effectiveness of the options we have available to us. Given that a high number of securities have been purchased, if we stopped the programme overnight it would cause a ""cliff, effect"", that is, a sharp drop in liquidity. We must manage the programme in such a way as to avoid that situation occurring in the markets, independent of pure monetary policy considerations.[end_answer] Negative rates, with which we have limited experience, have multiple consequences. Some are positive, others less so. They have, for instance, an influence on the exchange rate, which, as you know, is not a monetary policy objective. However, it is a very important transmission channel for prices and growth. Other countries have made use of that instrument, although they are generally smaller, open economies in which the exchange rate plays an important role.[end_answer] Our discussion does not hinge upon the decisions of the Federal Reserve System. And I would remind you that the exchange rate is not a monetary policy objective. Our decision will be based on the development of the situation in Europe, which can of course be influenced by a change of direction by the Fed. However, like the changing price of oil, this is something we don't have control over.[end_answer] When you have a single system of banking supervision, it is logical to have, in the long term, a deposit guarantee system that makes the consequences of supervisory failure a shared concern.","['underlying inflation', 'accelerate inflationary pressures']","['We also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures, such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for price-setting, etc', 'We also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures, such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for price-setting, etc']",1949,M,Luxembourg,2012 - 2019,"['inflation be expect to rise again at the beginning of next year owe to base effect on energy price ', 'however analyst should not focus so much on shortterm datum or on certain inflation expectation index ', 'we also look at underlie inflation and factor which accelerate inflationary pressure such as phenomenon that have an impact on the capacity for pricesette etc ']","['inflation be expect to rise again at the beginning of next year owe to base effect on energy price ', 'however analyst should not focus so much on shortterm datum or on certain inflation expectation index ', 'we also look at underlie inflation and factor which accelerate inflationary pressure such as phenomenon that have an impact on the capacity for pricesette etc ']",3,3,5368,[],0,"[""However analysts shouldn't focus so much on shortterm data or on certain inflation expectations indices."", 'We also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for pricesetting etc.']",5,2,['we also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for pricesetting etc'],['machine'],[True],"[('underlie', 'inflation'), ('inflationary', 'pressure')]",[],2,"['disease', 'machine']",2,2,['we also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for pricesetting etc'],['fire'],['we also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for pricesetting etc'],['machine'],['we also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for pricesetting etc'],['fire'],['fire'],[True],[False],[True],[True],[True],[False],[True],[False],[True],[False],[True],[True],[True],[False],[True],[False]
153,2015-10-29,Interview with Handelsblatt,Sabine Lautenschläger,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2015/html/sp151029_1.en.html,"Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism,29 October 2015","Ms Lautenschläger, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) came into effect just under a year ago. How would you summarise the progress made so far?[end_question] Are you now seeing some things less from a national point of view than you were when you were purely a German supervisor?[end_question] Now that you’re able to make a direct comparison, would you say that German banks are stronger or weaker than those in other countries?[end_question] ...and who does best?[end_question] So national differences do come into play, even within the SSM.[end_question] So, are you disappointed that there hasn’t been even more harmonisation?[end_question] The German government has recently been criticised for the way it has handled European supervision. Is Germany particularly idiosyncratic or are other countries behaving in a similar way?[end_question] Is it just Germany, or are other countries also behaving badly?[end_question] As a German banking supervisor, you always spoke out in favour of separating monetary policy from banking supervision. As the ECB’s Executive Board member responsible for supervision, are you still convinced?[end_question] Apart from when it comes to the separation of supervision and monetary policy.[end_question] That wasn’t the impression that was given when the focus was on Greek banks.[end_question] Well, the supervisor found Greek banks to be solvent – and now they are being extensively recapitalised.[end_question] How far advanced is the internal harmony in ECB supervision after a year, then? We keep hearing that there’s major cultural friction in the supervisory teams.[end_question] What conclusions have you drawn so far?[end_question] Where will the main focus of the ECB’s Supervisory Board lie in its second year?[end_question] Haven’t you already done that this year?[end_question] Has this overview led to any large capital surcharges so far?[end_question] Does that mean by less than 1%?[end_question] Could the low interest rates become a systemic risk for the banks?[end_question] In cases of doubt, would you impose capital surcharges on individual banks in order to take this into account?[end_question] Will the ECB also intervene in commercial decisions in such cases?[end_question] This year you have also looked at the area of cybercrime and IT risks.[end_question] What did you find out from the cyber survey?[end_question] Besides those, is there another burning issue?[end_question] Rules that have to be respected – that brings us close to the oft-cited cultural shift. How far have the banks got with that?[end_question] When is a cultural shift credible?[end_question] Are the current requirements already sufficient, or is there still a need to tighten up the bonus rules?[end_question] What period do you have in mind?[end_question] In any case, there seems to be more than enough supervisory work – you're recruiting another 200 supervisors.[end_question] Will the Eurotower as the headquarters of the banking supervision work have enough space for so many new supervisors?[end_question] Which areas do you want to strengthen?[end_question] Why is that?[end_question] You're not the only ones who have a lot to do – the banks have as well. The ECB is setting up a central credit register by the name of AnaCredit. Do banking supervisors have an insatiable appetite for data?[end_question] But the mania for collecting data is disconcerting.[end_question] But starting with the next steps the banking supervisors are playing a part.[end_question] In bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision?[end_question] What remains is the justified concern of the smaller banks that too much is being asked of them.[end_question] Are there small banks like ours elsewhere?[end_question] You complain that there’s so much incorrect information about AnaCredit. Why don’t you clarify things with the help of a public hearing?","It’s been a successful but demanding year. We’re well on the way to improving our supervision of European banks and making them more secure – for example in terms of risk analysis and capital.[end_answer] I’m obviously now seeing things much more “sharply” from a European point of view than when I was a German banking supervisor. I’m now looking at banks from 19 different countries, and they of course have different business models and risks. German banks, for example, are hardly active at all in South America, whereas Spanish banks are. So I have to take a completely different economic environment and national traditions into account, depending on the bank we are supervising. This diversity sharpens your view.[end_answer] I am wary of lumping the 1,800 or so banks in Germany together. German institutions are too different; some are profitable and crisis-proof, while others have to contend with a weak business model. The major advantage of European supervision is that we are able to compare the individual business areas, risk management and corporate management of different banks. For example, it’s worth comparing some of Deutsche Bank’s business areas with those of the French bank BNP Paribas.[end_answer] I can’t tell you, because confidentiality rules prevent me from speaking about individual institutions.[end_answer] In my current function, I experience daily how European law has been transposed into national law and how the respective national supervisors have applied the national and European rules in practice. The differences are indeed greater than I would have expected.[end_answer] When specific national features are justified and not associated with additional risks, I have less of a problem. For me, it’s more important that the same risk is treated equally, irrespective of whether the bank operates in France, Italy or Malta. And that should apply not just to banking supervision, but also to national supervisory law. National law should therefore be brought into alignment when it addresses comparable risks.[end_answer] To give you a specific example, Germany’s minimum requirements for risk management concern, among other things, rules for banks’ internal risk management and internal controls. The Ministry of Finance will probably be given the power to transpose the former administrative practices of the German supervisory authorities into national law. Unlike national administrative practices, we have to apply national law directly without being permitted to change it. Previous supervisory expectations will therefore be transposed into binding law, which will then only apply in Germany. This could make it more difficult for European banking supervisors to introduce uniform supervisory practices in the euro area. This sort of thing sends a dangerous signal to other countries.[end_answer] No, one or two countries have transposed national supervisory practices into national law. And then there is a big difference in terms of whether national laws were created before or after the SSM was launched.[end_answer] I am. However – and I’ve always said this – we would never have been able to set up and establish the SSM so quickly without the ECB. You simply need functioning administration which, for example, is able in a short space of time to process 26,000 applications and set up an IT system that 25 supervisory authorities plus the ECB are able to access. Furthermore, we shouldn’t forget that the ECB offers the SSM another major advantage: independence.[end_answer] That’s guaranteed. The separation principle is being complied with.[end_answer] It was also complied with in the case of the Greek banks. I don’t want to talk about individual decisions, but there is one issue where supervision and monetary policy always collide, regardless of whether you separate them or put them under one roof: emergency loans for banks. Central banks will always require information from supervisors about the solvency of the institution concerned in order to decide whether banks should receive emergency loans.[end_answer] Again, I’m not allowed to talk about individual decisions. But regardless of that, you should still consider separating supervision from monetary policy in the medium term in order to prevent any conflicts of interest.[end_answer] As a European supervisory body, we have to find largely uniform European solutions, even if these are often based on up to 19 different legal bases and overturn one or two cherished supervisory practices. Many things have been discussed and explained in the first year, partly because members of staff who manage a supervisory team don’t usually come from the home country of the bank they are supervising. That was a conscious decision. We wanted to get a fresh view of the institution, broaden our supervisory horizons and ensure that the bank concerned isn’t being supervised according to the old model.[end_answer] Not surprisingly, it’s worth bringing together different experiences. In Germany, we’ve come a long way compared with some European countries in terms of cluster risks, for example. On the important question of whether supervisory and other boards have the necessary skills, the German supervisory authorities have had extensive administrative practices for years, while other countries have more modern and more comprehensive strategies and methods with regard to how supervisors can drive forward a reduction in banks’ non-performing loans. We in Germany have taken a very individualised approach up to now.[end_answer] Among other things, we will further develop our methods of supervision, e.g. of liquidity management in banks. New requirements for the internal capital calculations and internal capital management of banks are also on the agenda for this year. And, without doubt, we will work even more closely on the business models.[end_answer] We have gained an initial overview. Now we are going to deepen it and add what comes to light in the institutions, including through adaptations of the business models. We are continuing to work on methods to improve the way we judge and compare the various business activities of the banks. To this end, we look for comparable business areas and activities in the banks and then compare, among other things, the margins achieved in these business areas and what collateral is demanded as well as what the risk management and processes look like. That will take longer than one year for 123 banks.[end_answer] That varies from case to case. Some banks have exactly the same capital requirements that they had before. Here and there the capital surcharges have shrunk, for example because the bank concerned has sold something and the risk has thereby become smaller. In other cases we have come to the conclusion, not only on the basis of the business model analysis, but also for other reasons, that higher capital surcharges are needed. Overall, the surcharges have risen slightly on average compared with last year.[end_answer] On average around 30 basis points, which will give us a satisfactorily conservative level of capital for the SSM as a whole. On top of this there are statutory buffers of around 20 basis points.[end_answer] The banks will be able to cope with a short phase of low interest rates. If it lasts longer, however, some institutions will be confronted with the question of the sustainability of their business model and how well they can cope with a collapse in their interest income. It will then matter a great deal what provisions the bank has made, how it cuts costs and how it can adapt its business model.[end_answer] Yes, certainly. It is also important to decide whether today, in view of the future challenges, profits should be retained in the bank rather than be distributed. However, lower interest rates can have an impact not only on the question of capital, but also on liquidity, i.e. when very short-term deposits are set against long-term loans.[end_answer] We are not the better bankers. It is not our task to decide what countermeasures a bank should take. However, it is our task to call upon the bank to take countermeasures or to have a plan B for potential risks. We want to see such a plan B when we do not consider risks to be adequately covered.[end_answer] Yes, we have gained an overview. We need that in order to be able to evaluate both standard and best practices in the European banking industry and to identify where the industry as a whole needs to do more and where individual banks need to catch up. Depending on the circumstances, we may need to take an individual approach or issue rules and requirements for all so that the standard as a whole is improved.[end_answer] We have not finished our evaluation yet. We will certainly pursue the subject of IT security further next year. We will probably have three main focus areas. We will look at the banks’ contingency planning, the outsourcing of IT services, and what capability banks have to protect themselves from attack.[end_answer] Yes, we want to build on this year’s survey on the topic of “risk governance and risk appetite”. At the moment we are considering initiating follow-up work at around 30 banks, including the very big ones. This also includes whether employees are given clear guidelines, and how the bank ensures that the guidelines are also respected.[end_answer] They have all made progress. Some are very advanced with the cultural shift; others have more to do. Ultimately, it is important that banks remember their principal task: they provide credit to households and businesses in a reliable and long-term partnership. And for a cultural shift you need not only clear rules and structures, but also role models and established practice.[end_answer] For a credible beginning, banks have to formulate as precisely as possible what they want to change and what they expect of their employees. The management of the bank must accept the consequences when someone violates the newly proclaimed guidelines. This must apply regardless of the person’s position in the bank’s hierarchy, from the lowliest employee to the most senior level. Without rigorousness and consistency, a cultural shift cannot be expected of any employee.[end_answer] For remuneration there are already quite a number of rules. At the moment the payout is spread over a minimum of three to five years. For some business areas, a longer period could be tested – at least for those whose profitability can be assessed over the long term.[end_answer] A minimum period of five years could be considered.[end_answer] We have calculated our needs for a two-year period. For 2016 an increase of 160 new banking supervisors has already been agreed. For 2017, we know roughly what we need, but next year that will have to go through the normal budgetary process.[end_answer] I won't say anything about buildings – it’s too early for that.[end_answer] Basically we need more supervisors for the small and medium-sized banks which we supervise directly. For the smallest of the significant institutions we often have a full-time employee who works part of the time on them. But a small institution that we supervise directly may be the largest bank in its home country – and thus very important for that country’s financial stability. The workload involved when working across the various fields is greater than we thought.[end_answer] For one thing, we take decisions more frequently than was foreseen in 2013. For another, the handling of many issues is much more laborious than we thought, also because national legislation is so different. That's the case, for instance, with the “fit and proper” tests, which check the suitability of new bank directors. For these tests alone there are 19 very different sets of legal requirements. Another example: when new banks are licensed or there’s a change of ownership the supervisors have to check once again what we want at European level, what the national legislation says, and how we then create a common European approach to supervision, despite the limits imposed on us by national legislation. That's an enormous amount of work.[end_answer] Hold on, AnaCredit has had nothing to do with banking supervision so far. Work on AnaCredit got under way in 2011, when nobody was thinking about joint European supervision. The first stage will contain no single supervisory requirement even though we, as supervisors, will of course also use the findings from the data collected. It was the central banks, which need better and more detailed data as the basis for their work, that were the trigger for AnaCredit.[end_answer] We need AnaCredit in order to have a good monetary policy, among other things. If we want to know if our monetary policy measures are having an effect on households, we need information about loans to households. The threshold of €1 million, which is common in Germany, doesn’t help. That's not a household scale. That's why the reporting threshold is €25,000; above that level loans should be registered. For a supervisor €25,000 is not relevant, but it is for a monetary policy-maker.[end_answer] We want to and have to be efficient, also in the interest of the banks. If we ask for data, then we should also take into account the supervisors’ requirements in the second and third stages. That’s in the interest of the banks, even if there is no additional request from the supervisors. It’s also important for discussions about global regulatory affairs.[end_answer] I need, for instance, data for regulatory discussions, whether at global or EU level, in order to show that in respect of some risk issues we are indeed in a better position than, or in a different position to, other parts of the world. If, however, I cannot prove in quantitative terms that certain risks appear to be different here than they are elsewhere, for instance because of our specific legal starting position, then I go into such discussions with a weak hand. Let me be specific: if, for the banks' capital requirements, you are discussing risk weightings for medium-sized businesses or for private customers then you have to be able to show something. It's not enough to claim something; discussions are won by offering proof.[end_answer] That’s a very German problem. In other countries there are credit registers and queries which start at €50. Moreover, there are exceptions for the smallest banks.[end_answer] Yes. It’s also a matter of the data that each bank should have saved in its IT system. Maybe one or two institutions have a problem with AnaCredit because it has stored the information on different IT systems. Standardising the systems can also be a big advantage for the bank.[end_answer] We and the national central banks have spoken with all the associations, but not publicly. The European Data Protection Officer was also consulted and we have considered his comments. The first stage of AnaCredit only serves central bank purposes; a public hearing is unnecessary for that. The situation changes as soon as supervision comes into play in the second stage. But we haven’t got to that point yet. The preparations have got under way and the ECB will be talking to all participants. I think we’ll get good results because AnaCredit is in everyone’s interest.

158,2015-09-19,Interview with NEUE ZÜRCHER ZEITUNG,Peter Praet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2015/html/sp150919.en.html,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,conducted by Claudia Aebersold Szalay and Peter A. Fischer","Mr Praet, you have been Chief Economist of the ECB for the past four years now. During this period, the policy of the ECB has changed somewhat. Does it make a difference who the Chief Economist of the ECB is?[end_question] The crisis nonetheless escalated.[end_question] You give the impression, however, that you take a more Anglo-Saxon approach, whereas your two predecessors, Issing and Stark, were rather more of the tradition of the Deutsche Bundesbank and were, therefore, more stability-oriented in their thinking.[end_question] However, on the issue of the purchase of government bonds, there has been a true break with past tradition. Your predecessors were strictly against it, whereas you and Mario Draghi are clearly in favour of these purchases.[end_question] Critics say that the ECB has gone too far and that, with its ultra-expansionary policy, it has sown the seeds of the next crisis.[end_question] But monetary policy has taken over too much of the burden from politics during the crisis.[end_question] The euro area has not given a good impression of itself during the crisis?[end_question] And when several Member States faced financial difficulties…[end_question] Except the International Monetary Fund.[end_question] In the meantime, has the institutional framework improved in the euro area?[end_question] Was the absence of an institutional framework the main problem behind the crisis?[end_question] Exactly, the governments had to save. Was austerity wrong, because it forced governments to save?[end_question] Now the ECB is even pursuing quantitative easing, and, over the past six months, has been buying government bonds. Thus far, the ECB has purchased a good €400 billion worth of assets, by the autumn of 2016, it is supposed to amount to over €1 trillion. What is your assessment after six months?[end_question] But Mario Draghi is already talking about expanding the programme.[end_question] Is there any point in already thinking about an expansion?[end_question] Were you too optimistic with your economic forecasts in the spring?[end_question] On Thursday, the US Federal Reserve System decided not to raise interest rates. Does this decision make life easier or more difficult for the ECB?[end_question] How much of its growth potential did the euro area lose during the crisis?[end_question] But monetary policy cannot change that.[end_question] What should the latter do specifically?[end_question] But these reforms seem to be taking a long time.[end_question] Are you also as confident about Greece?[end_question] And will the new programme bring relief?[end_question] Let us focus on Switzerland. It is clear that the policies of the ECB have a strong influence on a small, open economy like Switzerland. Is it still at all possible for the Swiss National Bank to pursue an independent monetary policy?[end_question] And has the expansionary policy of the ECB not played a role?[end_question] Are you not making it too easy for yourself?[end_question] But the ECB’s quantitative easing did also weaken the euro and thereby strengthen the Swiss franc?[end_question] Should there also be rules governing an orderly exit from the euro area?[end_question] What will the euro area look like at the end of your period of office at the ECB?","Both the President and the Chief Economist have changed, but what has changed most of all during this period is the economic environment in which we find ourselves. At the onset of the crisis in 2007, we still thought we were simply dealing with an external liquidity shock. So, the central banks across the globe reacted accordingly, and at the time the ECB also focused on providing liquidity to banks. I can still remember the headlines back then, saying that the ECB was providing €100 billion in liquidity, which seemed an incredible sum at the time.[end_answer] Yes, it quickly turned into a credit crunch, which in 2012 escalated into a euro crisis. However, to come back to your first question: the circumstances have changed dramatically; the identity of the Chief Economist plays a minor role in that sense. ECB decisions are not a “one-man show”, but rather the result of discussions amongst the members of the Governing Council. That is an open, professional and collegial exchange, and this is the basis on which the ECB’s Governing Council makes its decisions.[end_answer] I would firmly disagree. I and the entire Executive Board of the ECB have utterly committed ourselves to price stability. That is our mandate, the task enshrined in the European treaties. We see price stability as symmetrical; it works in both directions. We fight inflation – when prices rise too quickly – with the same determination as when prices rise too slowly. And with our policy we have certainly been successful in terms of counteracting fears of deflation, I should like to think. All of our policies, including the less conventional ones, are aimed at maintaining price stability. By the way, during the time of my predecessor Otmar Issing, the ECB defined more precisely what is meant by price stability: below, but close to, 2%.[end_answer] Who knows what my predecessors would have done in my position. They were not in a situation in which key interest rates had reached the lower limit, thereby leaving hardly any room for manoeuvre in terms of interest rates. However, I am sure that they would also have done everything necessary to fulfil the mandate. Besides, there was also a government bond purchase programme under the former President Jean-Claude Trichet, only it was much smaller than the current one.[end_answer] We are well aware of the fact that an expansionary monetary policy entails some risks to financial stability. We are, nonetheless, convinced that we have acted in the right way, as we have followed our mandate. As we are not seeing a strong rise in lending, nor any signs of widespread speculative bubbles, the risks for financial stability are currently limited.[end_answer] It is true that too much weight has been placed on monetary policy in managing the crisis. I would also have liked other stakeholders to have taken more responsibility in this respect. But that does not change the fact that the ECB must act first and foremost in order to fulfil its mandate.[end_answer] One of the biggest problems was that the architecture of the euro area was not yet complete. We simply did not yet have all the institutions that are needed for quick and effective crisis management. The euro area already had important principles, such as the no bail-out clause, the prohibition of monetary financing and the no-exit clause. But serious design flaws also became apparent, which nurtured excesses and contributed to the scale of the crisis.[end_answer] … the right structures were not in place in order to deal with them. No efficient mechanism to, if necessary, refinance public and private debt or restructure or resolve troubled banks. Nor were there any supranational institutions that were in a position to do so.[end_answer] Yes, there was the IMF, but to start with, many people in Europe were not too happy about the IMF being involved in the euro area. I was always in favour of having the IMF on board, because in Europe, we simply did not have any institution that could have taken on this role.[end_answer] Yes, very much so. We now have the European Stability Mechanism, we have made good progress with the banking union, and we have a European supervisory mechanism. That is an important step and more will follow. The euro area needs more integration.[end_answer] One of the main problems. The other problem was that the governments in the euro area had little fiscal room for manoeuvre in order to respond to the crisis.[end_answer] No, the return to sound national budgets was necessary, because, during the sovereign debt crisis, it was all a question of regaining confidence in the public finances in the euro area in order to curb speculation of a break-up of the euro. But, of course, the fact that the governments had so little fiscal room for manoeuvre led to a worsening of the crisis and meant the ECB had to do even more to still fulfil its mandate.[end_answer] The ECB’s purchase programme is a success. It is already having an effect in terms of inflation expectations, for example, which have recovered again, and in terms of the general financing conditions, which have eased somewhat.[end_answer] He is repeating what we have said from the beginning, i.e. that the programme is flexible and can be adapted if necessary.[end_answer] The only important thing is to emphasise our readiness and our resolve to act if necessary. At the moment, that would be premature, but the risks in the world economy have grown significantly. We have had to lower our economic forecasts, and we simply want to be ready to act if the circumstances so demand.[end_answer] We were accused of that, but I don’t think so. The downward adjustment in September was not large and was mainly due to the correction in the emerging markets. The economic recovery in the euro area itself is intact.[end_answer] The euro area is in a very different cyclical phase from the US economy. Therefore, our monetary policy cycles are also not synchronised. Nonetheless, we share the concerns about the prospects for the global economy. If we judged that shocks were sufficiently severe and persistent to weaken the inflation outlook for the euro area, we would not hesitate to act.[end_answer] The potential had already weakened before the onset of the crisis, because productivity growth had slowed down. The crisis then made everything even worse, so today the euro area is on a much lower growth path.[end_answer] Monetary policy can only cushion the problem by, for example, making liquidity available and thereby helping to avoid a banking crisis. Monetary policy cannot create sustainable growth. For that, it is necessary to have intelligent structural reforms which strengthen the growth potential of the economy. However, that is not the task of the central bank, but of the governments.[end_answer] They must undertake structural reforms to lay the foundations for higher productivity and growth. Europe needs intelligent reforms.[end_answer] You are being too pessimistic. We can see encouraging signs in the euro area, particularly in countries like Spain and Ireland, but also in Portugal. Italy was admittedly late in starting reforms, but is now on the right track.[end_answer] The situation in Greece is still difficult, but with the new programme we have made a step forwards.[end_answer] The programme is indeed demanding, but we are convinced that the reforms will help Greece to create growth again and make its way out of the crisis. However, in view of the forthcoming elections, I do not wish to add anything further on that.[end_answer] There can be no doubt that every monetary policy also has an impact on other currency areas. However, the biggest impact on Switzerland does not come from the ECB, but from the policies of the euro area countries. The weak crisis management by politicians in the euro area has led to investors seeking safe havens such as Switzerland, which has strongly pushed up the price of the Swiss franc.[end_answer] I believe our policy has helped to allay fears, and has thus tended rather to reduce the flight to the Swiss franc. When the euro area does better, the Swiss franc is under less upward pressure.[end_answer] The ECB took responsibility in the crisis and thereby helped reduce uncertainty in the financial markets and even avoid panic. In doing so, it also took the pressure off currencies like the Swiss franc. Naturally, all of this would have been much more effective if European governments had also done better with their crisis management.[end_answer] Bear in mind that the Swiss National Bank also introduced a kind of quantitative easing and expanded its balance sheet – long before we did, by the way. In spite of this policy, for a long time the inflation rate in Switzerland has been even lower than in the euro area. It is difficult for a central bank in such a situation to avoid the appreciation of its currency in the long term.[end_answer] I believe that there is need for a crisis management system and a resolution mechanism for overindebted institutions, whether private or public.[end_answer] We will again have inflation rates below, but close to, 2%, because our policy will achieve its goal. And the banking union will be complete, meaning that the resolution regime and the deposit protection will be fully Europeanised. For me, this is a precondition for a well-functioning monetary union. In four years, Europe will be in a much healthier state than today.","['fight inflation', 'counteracting fears of deflation', 'inflation rate in Switzerland has been even lower', 'inflation rates

168,2015-05-04,Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad,Vítor Constâncio,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2015/html/sp150504.en.html,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Marcel de Boer and Saskia Jonker on 29 April 2015",,"The ECB’s controversial purchase programme will not be halted prematurely, even if the economy in Europe is picking up more rapidly than expected, said Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank (ECB), in an interview with Het Financieele Dagblad.[end_answer] “The programme is working well. Why should we think of discontinuing it when inflation is negative and inflation expectations are nowhere near our medium-term goal of close to 2%?” So that option is not even on the table for the Executive Board of the ECB. “We only started it a few months ago. It would be very strange if we were already talking about stopping.”[end_answer] Critics argue that the ECB is creating bubbles in asset markets because all markets are being driven up by the large-scale purchase programme (known as quantitative easing). But the Portugese central banker is not afraid of that. “There is no generalised asset overvaluations in the euro area.” He acknowledges that quantitative easing is making investors take more risks because that is more profitable. “That is partly what we want to achieve through our programme, this so-called portfolio shift. The only danger is that the “search for yield” might get out of hand. We need to keep a close eye on that. It is the job of macroprudential policy, not of monetary policy, to avoid the build-up of bubbles”.[end_answer] The view from the 41st and top floor of the European Central Bank’s new premises is overwhelming: huge buildings that suddenly look quite small, bright green patches of spring foliage, and aeroplanes in the distance glistening in the sun as they take off from Frankfurt. Vítor Constâncio contentedly takes in his surroundings as he enters the meeting room, slightly late but completely relaxed. Slight of stature and wearing a grey suit, Constâncio, a Portugese national, has every reason to be pleased: the ECB’s purchase programme is working, he says. “The European economy is moving in the right direction.” And he has the data to support that statement at his fingertips.[end_answer] “The sale of durable consumer goods has grown by 4.5% in a year, share prices have risen by 13% since the start of this year, the price of capital for non-financial firms is 7.7% – which is similar to pre-crisis levels. For banks, too, funding has become considerably cheaper.” In short, financial conditions have improved. “Even though some critics said that quantitative easing would be less effective here than in the United States, because much of the financing is provided by banks. They forget that banks are listed on the stock exchange too.”[end_answer] But Constâncio disagrees that things are going well enough to already start tapering off quantative easing – inflation expectations are too low for that. Until inflation comes sustainably close to 2%, the ECB will continue to intervene in the financial markets, with the attendant risks such as rapid asset price increases and the disadvantage of low returns for pension funds.[end_answer] “Exchange rates reflect the economic situation in the various countries. The US economy, for example, is in a completely different phase of the business cycle than Europe. That explains why monetary policy here is not the same as in the United States. The G20 also look at it that way.'[end_answer] “All policy measures have their side effects. There is collateral damage, but we have a mandate and that states that we must maintain price stability. Having said that, it is important to note that insurance firms especially have not done so badly in recent years. The value of their assets increased precisely on the back of the lower interest rates and they were able to push up the profit per share, more so than the banks could in any case. Low interest rates are now causing problems, but it is exactly our objective to bring things back to normal. Once we have price stability, interest rates will also go up again.”[end_answer] “Here and there, we see that the maturity of the investments is out of sync with the maturity of liabilities. We also see that few strategies have yet been designed that would render insurance firms immune to this mismatch. That is why they should be cautious about the promises that they make to their customers.”[end_answer] “The stock of available securities is vast. The universe of eligible assets which we could buy amounts to €600 billion in covered bonds, €400 billion in asset-backed securities and more than €3,000 billion in sovereign bonds. It is true that we are not purchasing any securities on which the interest rate has dropped below -0.2%. But there is still plenty of securities available for purchases. What we could do if that changes is hypothetical, and you know that policy-makers don’t discuss hypothetical situations.”[end_answer] “First and foremost, the purchase of securities is an instrument that we can use because it is in line with our statute. There is nothing that controversial about it, but the same cannot be said for your “helicopter money”. Moreover, with our programme we are injecting money into the economy. That money will bring about an improvement in market conditions and thereby make it easier for private parties to access financing.[end_answer] “Helicopter money has had different meanings in various contexts, from giving money directly to households to financing of public infrastructure. But all these options would bring us very close to pursuing fiscal policy. And that’s what we cannot do.”[end_answer] “Like everyone else, I am concerned. But I am also absolutely convinced that the worst-case scenario will be avoided. At the same time, everyone acknowledges that the degree of stress and vulnerability in the euro area has totally changed. There are no signs of contagion.”[end_answer] “The Eurosystem (the ECB and the national central banks, ed.) has lent a total of some €110 billion to Greek banks. But the risk on just over €70 billion of that amount has been shifted to the Greek central bank. We jointly bear the risk on the rest of the amount. But bear in mind that collateral has been provided. We are talking about securities that are not linked to the Greek sovereign and which, on top of that, are subject to a “haircut”. This should offer sufficient protection.”[end_answer] “That would be the capital markets union. Although it is not our direct responsibility – the European Commission is responsible for the proposals – it is very important for us. A well-integrated and deep capital market would facilitate the functioning of our monetary policy, as our key interest rates would then be transmitted more smoothly. And there would be more risk-sharing via ownership of assets. If an economic recession arose in a euro area country, an effective capital markets union would soften the consequences of that recession. But the benefits of a capital markets union can only be reaped if a truly ambitious approach is taken here.“[end_answer] “An effective capital markets union requires the harmonisation of company law, of bankruptcy law, of taxation of financial products and of regulatory and supervisory frameworks. That is an enormous task. This way firms could issue shares and debt across the union, to a much greater extent than they do now, as a result of the level playing field for all stakeholders (the shareholders, the issuers, etc., ed.). But we must not forget that the European countries have already come far in harmonising policy, especially the euro area countries.”[end_answer] “If it is completed in 2019, I would be very happy.”","['inflation is negative', 'inflation comes']","['Why should we think of discontinuing it when inflation is negative and inflation expectations are nowhere near our medium-term goal of close to 2%', 'Until inflation comes sustainably close to 2%, the ECB will continue to intervene in the financial markets, with the attendant risks such as rapid asset price increases and the disadvantage of low returns for pension funds']",1943,M,Portugal,2010 - 2018,"['why should we think of discontinue it when inflation be negative and inflation expectation be nowhere near our mediumterm goal of close to ?

169,2015-04-22,Interview with Kathimerini,Benoît Cœuré,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2015/html/sp150422.en.html,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,conducted by Alexis Papahelas on 22 April 2015","The Greek government would like to reach an agreement on a new programme in June without concluding the current review. Is that acceptable? Will Greece need a new programme anyway in order to finance its fiscal needs?[end_question] The Greek government claims that it should get the SMP profits without concluding the programme review in order to overcome the liquidity crunch it is facing. Could this happen?[end_question] There has been speculation that the Greek government might not pay the next instalment to the IMF. What would the consequences of such a move be?[end_question] Is the Greek banking system adequately capitalised or will it need further recapitalisation? Is the “Cyprus model” of a bail-in an option?[end_question] According to various reports, the ECB has prepared capital controls or IOU contingencies for Greece. Could you comment on these, and under what circumstances would they be applied?[end_question] Is there a limit to the increase in emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to the banking system? If no agreement is reached by 11 May, is the ELA going to be affected?[end_question] At the last press conference the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, called discussion of a “Grexit” premature. Isn’t this scenario a huge risk for the euro area?[end_question] Is the Greek debt viable? Was it a mistake not to restructure it at the beginning of the programme? How would the sustainability of debt be affected if the targets for growth, fiscal indicators and privatisations aren’t met?[end_question] While the rest of the euro area is already benefiting from quantitative easing, Greece is totally isolated from this development. Doesn’t this undermine the long-term growth prospects of Greece and consequently the possibility of reducing unemployment faster? What can the ECB do about it?[end_question] Greek government officials have said that the ECB is using liquidity as a means to blackmail Greece. Prime Minister Tsipras even said that the ECB has got a rope around Greece’s neck. What is your comment on that?","Since the elections were announced, heightened uncertainty has been dragging down economic activity and risks impacting the health of the financial system. The current situation is clearly not sustainable and requires quick and decisive action by the Greek authorities to turn things around. In recent days, there has been tangible progress in the quality of the discussions with the three institutions – the ECB, the European Commission and the IMF – which can be built upon. Still, significant differences on substance remain and substantial further work is needed. We wish these discussions to succeed. The current programme was extended by the Eurogroup on 20 February with the express purpose of working towards a conclusion of the review. It expires on 30 June, and the Eurogroup has also made it clear that a new programme would, as a minimum, require the present one – and thus the present review – to be successfully concluded in good time. This is what the Greek government now has to focus all its energy on. Issues related to a possible follow-up arrangement can be addressed afterwards.[end_answer] The so-called “SMP profits”, i.e. the profits made by the ECB on the Greek bonds it purchased during the crisis, are distributed to the National Central banks that are members of the ECB and then are transferred to the Member States. It is therefore for euro area governments to decide when to transfer the money to Athens. The Eurogroup clarified on 20 February that only a successful conclusion of the review will permit this transfer.[end_answer] You are right to ask about consequences. And it is important to understand all the consequences for the economy and for the people, direct and indirect, that would result from a failure to repay debt in a timely manner. Let me give you just one very important one, which is that it would constrain the ability of banks to support the economy: if the government were to default on its debt, then obviously the value of government bonds would be negatively affected. This would make it more difficult for banks to obtain liquidity, because at the moment they rely for that on government bonds which they use as collateral, both in the market and with the Eurosystem. So it would impair the ability of banks to provide credit, which would be detrimental to the Greek people in general. But the government has been clear that it intends to honour its obligations to all its creditors, so I don’t want to speculate on other, more adverse scenarios.[end_answer] The Greek banking sector is better capitalised than in previous years due to the capital injections under the programme over the last two years and continued progress in bank restructuring. These measures made Greek banks attractive to external investors, who participated last year in capital increases. The improved resilience was also confirmed last year in the ECB’s comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets. At the same time, non-performing loans continue to weigh on banks’ balance sheets. The progress that has been achieved in the Greek banking sector is currently overshadowed by the heightened political uncertainty, hence the importance of prompt policy action.[end_answer] Capital controls are not a working assumption. In any case, it would not be up to the ECB to take measures of that sort. Those fall within the competence of national authorities, which means the Greek authorities.[end_answer] We are the central bank of Greece and we have always fully played our role to support the banking system and thereby its ability to fund the economy. This means in particular that we have always ensured that solvent banks remained funded, despite the stress they have been under. But like everybody, we have to act within the law. And the EU Treaty requires two things of us: first that we lend only to solvent banks; and second that we lend only against adequate collateral. So we will continue to extend liquidity to the Greek banks, as long as they are solvent and they have adequate collateral, as is the case today. Indeed, the amount of assistance we have provided is considerable. Just look at the facts: emergency liquidity assistance has been increased week after week by the Bank of Greece according to the needs of the system. As a result, the Greek banking system currently receives around €110 billion of central bank liquidity, more than double the level of last December and 61% of Greek GDP, the highest level of any euro area country.[end_answer] It is out of the question to speculate about such a scenario. The euro area needs Greece just as Greece needs the euro. An overwhelming majority of the Greek population want to keep the euro. It is the responsibility of the Greek government to take the appropriate steps to ensure that its policies are in line with these clear preferences.[end_answer] Let me start by expressing regret that several of the latest policy initiatives and announcements have worsened the outlook for debt sustainability. In the short term, the burden and risks associated with the large stock of debt are substantially mitigated by the fact that more than 60% of Greece’s debt is financed by the European Financial Stability Facility and euro area governments through bilateral loans at very favourable conditions. The low interest rate on official loans has a positive impact on fiscal accounts, and the long average maturity of Greek debt reduces refinancing risks. Over the coming years, Greece will devote a much lower share of national income to debt service than many other euro area countries, such as Spain, Portugal and, in particular, Italy. The Greek government can use the opportunities created by this concessional funding support provided by European partners to undertake reforms and maintain a prudent fiscal path, with the ultimate objective of allowing a return to full market financing. Looking ahead, whether long-term debt sustainability will require further effort by the Member States is not for the ECB to decide. As for the debt held by the ECB itself through the SMP, the EU Treaties do not allow us to cancel or extend that debt.[end_answer] It is true that one consequence of the policy uncertainty currently prevailing in Greece is that the economy is benefiting less than it could from the cyclical rise in demand in the euro area, which our monetary policy is facilitating with visible effects. This is unfortunate for growth and employment in the near term, and one more reason to wish that this period of uncertainty is brought to an end as soon as possible. As regards long-term growth, let me clarify, however, that our asset purchase programme can do little to lift long-term growth, in Greece or in any other euro area country. Our policy is aimed at bringing euro area inflation back to levels below but close to 2%. It can engineer a cyclical recovery, not a long-lasting one. Long-term growth is driven by the capacity to innovate and to efficiently allocate capital and labour, which hinges on reforms undertaken by governments.[end_answer] Why aren’t we currently buying Greek bonds? For their bonds to be eligible for the ECB’s asset purchase programme, euro area countries need to have a sufficiently high credit rating. This requirement can be waived only if an EU-IMF programme has been implemented and successfully reviewed, which is not the case today in Greece.[end_answer] Decisions by the ECB are guided by rules, not political considerations. Following these rules, the ECB has fully played its role as the central bank of Greece, continuously increasing its liquidity provision to Greek banks to ensure that they can serve the real economy. What we cannot do is fund the government, for example by refinancing Greek banks’ purchases of T-bills at a time when the Hellenic Republic does not have market access. This is due to the fact that, for very good reasons, the EU Treaty prohibits any central bank from financing its government. This applies to Greece as to any other euro area country, and our decisions have followed exactly the same rules under this government as under the previous ones. The ECB is the central bank of Greece, but we are also the central bank of 18 other countries and we cannot bend our rules to suit the occasion. The Greek government can relieve funding constraints by pursuing policies which will open the way to disbursements by other Member States under the programme and, ultimately, restore market access. Let me add that the ECB’s monetary policy stance is currently very accommodative.

170,2015-04-08,Interview with Börsen-Zeitung,Yves Mersch,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2015/html/sp150408.en.html,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,conducted by Mark Schrörs and published on 8 April 2015","Mr Mersch, the start of the ECB’s public sector purchase programme has made a deep impression on the financial markets: the stock markets are up, the euro is sharply down and the returns on euro government bonds have clearly fallen again. How surprised are you by the strength of the impact of quantitative easing (QE)?[end_question] But aren’t such reports about the successful effect of QE on the real economy somewhat premature? Previously, even the ECB used to say that monetary policy measures take 12-18 months to have an effect.[end_question] Because the economy of the euro area was at a turning point, not least because of cheaper oil?[end_question] But isn’t there also a danger of “overdosing”?[end_question] In other words, if the new projections in June foresee an overshooting of the inflation target of just below 2% in 2017, as is currently conceivable, would you be in favour of a discussion to reduce purchases or to stop them earlier?[end_question] Some market participants are claiming that the ECB is putting its credibility at risk in the case of a reduction [of the purchases]. But wouldn’t it also be a problem if the forecast were to rise above 2% and you were to continue with QE and not react?[end_question] ...in which a central bank specifies a certain price development which it has to achieve every year. If it doesn’t manage it, the bank has to steer towards it all the more resolutely in the following year.[end_question] So you don’t believe in allowing temporarily higher inflation in future, because inflation was significantly below the 2% target in recent years?[end_question] QE is ostensibly the answer to the long-lasting very low inflation. But is that really so dangerous if it is due to falling oil prices?[end_question] This means you would have voted in January for QE if a formal vote had been taken in the Governing Council?[end_question] Sometimes one has the feeling of being a “topsy-turvy world”: the Fed, which has traditionally been very worried about deflation, is relatively relaxed in view of the oil-price-depressed inflation. The ECB, however, which has always warned against exaggerated fears of deflation is very alarmed. How come?[end_question] You mentioned inflation expectations. A closely followed indicator is the “5y5y” rate, i.e. the markets’ expectations of the inflation rate in five years’ time for the five years thereafter. This rose at the start of QE, but only slightly. Are you disappointed?[end_question] How great is the risk that the ECB may at some time no longer find enough bonds to purchase? Sure, ultimately everything depends on the price. But it can’t be in your interest to pay excessive prices.[end_question] Some people are speculating that the ECB could reduce its deposit rate of -0.2% still further in order to increase the pool of available bonds, as the rate forms the lower limit at which government securities can be bought with a negative return.[end_question] With the launch of QE the euro has fallen in value once again. It has stabilised more recently. Are you pleased about that? When does a devaluation become a problem?[end_question] But didn’t we reach that point a while ago, according to some commentators from Rome or Paris?[end_question] The QE programme is currently designed to come to an abrupt end between September and October 2016. The Federal Reserve has been finding out how difficult it is to exit and has been tapering its purchases. Does the ECB have to make some adjustments in that respect?[end_question] But when embarking on such a policy shouldn’t you have an exit strategy ready?[end_question] In Germany there’s a debate raging about the ECB’s inflation target of “below, but close to, 2%”. Some are saying that price stability is actually 0% and that it is crazy for the ECB to use all ways and means to create inflation.[end_question] Greece is currently another major issue for the ECB. How painful is it for you to rubber-stamp the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) for Greece’s banks in volumes of more than €70 billion?[end_question] With this argument the ECB is also rejecting Athens’ attempt to raise the limits for the issuance of short-term government securities, the T-bills. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann however goes one step further. He already sees a problem if Greek banks extend T-bills, i.e. perform a “rollover”. Is he right or is he too strict?[end_question] That means that the course is set and that no more T-bills should be issued, but it can even amount to a requirement for Athens to reduce the volume?[end_question] The government in Athens is complaining that the ECB was less severe with the previous government in 2012.[end_question] How frustrated are you by the government in Athens? The fragile recovery in Greece seems to be stalled and government finances are deteriorating.[end_question] In your view, would it make sense to introduce capital controls in order to stop the enormous outflows of capital?[end_question] Or is it too late because a lot money has already “fled”?[end_question] How likely is it that Greece deliberately or “accidentally” leaves the euro area?[end_question] Large-scale purchase of government bonds by the ECB, new flexibility in the stability pact – is there a fundamental change under way in the monetary union, away from the idea of a stability union?[end_question] How can that be done?[end_question] Are you still convinced that the euro is more of a boon than a bane? Some observers have long been saying that it only sows discord.[end_question] In monetary policy circles there’s a discussion raging about the “new normal”. Are non-standard instruments and mini or even negative rates the new normal for central banks?[end_question] And what about negative interest rates?[end_question] So you believe that at some time we’ll have key rates of 3% or 4% again? Many observers can hardly believe that and the problems the Fed is having in reversing its interest rate policy are strengthening such beliefs.","It’s true, long-term interest rates have fallen further, in some cases to all-time lows. All in all, the financing conditions for the economy have improved. There are also signs that we will soon be moving into positive territory again in terms of lending. It would perhaps be somewhat bold to claim that the better mood in the economy is solely due to QE. But it is clear that QE is having a signalling effect and this channel is working very successfully.[end_answer] Yes, but monetary policy also works via the signalling channel and in this case it works very effectively and quickly. Now we have to wait and see how the other channels work. However, the decision on QE certainly came at the right time.[end_answer] At the beginning of the year we had weakly positive signs. With QE, this development has strengthened.[end_answer] The Governing Council will carefully monitor the situation every month. We have now adopted a plan that we intend to follow up on: we are making purchases to the tune of €60 billion every month until September 2016. This forms the basis for our March projections, which envisage a slow return to an inflation rate that is close to our understanding of stable prices: accordingly, we shall be at 1.8% in 2017. However, if we see that we are going beyond that figure, it would of course be appropriate to consider whether we need to adjust our plan.[end_answer] Let me say again: we have specified a course of action and we’ll be sticking to it. If we see that it is bringing us more quickly to our goal, we are of course not so tied to our decisions that we could not adjust our course of action. Incidentally, that also applies should we do not come close to the target. We cannot in either instance turn our eyes from reality.[end_answer] What you are mentioning plays into the discussion on price-level targeting...[end_answer] The proponents argue that we should declare this to be a new strategy. But in my view, that would be the wrong approach: it would be a fundamental change in an environment in which steadfastness and anchoring a proven strategy are very important. Moreover, in theory and under certain conditions this approach may be clever, but in practice, it is a highly questionable experiment.[end_answer] I don’t find this approach at all convincing. Such a change in our strategy would, in my eyes, be incompatible with stability. The Governing Council’s decision refers to “…a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.[end_answer] I also distinguish between an undershooting of zero inflation, which is mainly attributable to temporary phenomena such as the price of oil, and on which we can effectively have no influence, and a general fall in the price level. Before January, however, the proportion of goods for which the rate of increase was less than 0.5% was steadily rising. Also, inflation expectations slumped from 1.8% to 1.4%. These were the arguments that persuaded me to recognise that we had to turn to the final resort.[end_answer] I've never said publicly how I vote in the Council – because that is forbidden and all those voting respect this.[end_answer] As far as I can remember, we have never been in a situation where things have turned negative so quickly. I would not say that in January we were already at a point where consumers postpone their purchases in the expectation of falling prices. But the danger was that we were heading for such a situation. In addition, lending has been falling for years. Since April 2014, the situation has been improving, but at a worryingly slow pace. That’s another reason why we could not just sit back and say, things will get better by themselves. We have a mandate and should try to achieve that goal not only over a five-year cycle, but as soon as possible.[end_answer] We are not 5y5y fetishists. We know the weaknesses of individual indicators. But what has worried me was the sagging that occurred under a certain limit. When it dropped to 1.4%, it was a free fall and there was a risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. At 1.7% to 1.8%, we are now back at a level of expectations that is more closely in line with our medium-term projections.[end_answer] High prices inversely mean low interest rates – that is now precisely what we are aiming for. I don’t think there will be any shortage generally: many euro bonds have been issued and are available on the market because foreign investors have other regulatory requirements. In one segment or another there may be a shortage. Then we have to see how we handle it. Of course, the range of public offerings is defined very broadly and extends beyond central government. In any case, the programme is being constantly monitored.[end_answer] This is certainly a theoretical possibility. But we must always ask ourselves whether an instrument is appropriate and proportionate. Such a cost/benefit analysis, to my mind, rules out that we are going down further with the deposit rate. We have also repeatedly said that we have reached the lower limit in respect of the interest rates. Please take a look at our most recently published “account”, the non-verbatim summary of the monetary policy discussion of the Governing Council members.[end_answer] Exchange rate developments are always dangerous when they are extreme and out of line with fundamentals. That still applies. For me, it’s time for the highest level of alarm when attempts are made to use the exchange rate as an instrument – and under the pretext of returning to stable prices, in order to improve competitiveness. That would deviate completely from our obligations, as laid down in the EU Treaty. That would be a red alert.[end_answer] There will always be atavistic reactions. But I do not want to overstate them. We at the ECB have no exchange rate target, and we don’t even use the exchange rate as an intermediate target. We are aware that it plays an important role in inflation. That’s all. Let me stress that it would be a mistake to regard the exchange rate as an instrument of general economic policy.[end_answer] First of all, I'm very glad you asked me about the exit. Many others are only focusing on what else the ECB can do. We still have a lot of persuading to do. But of course you have a point, we absolutely have to avoid “cliff-edge” effects. The entire monetary policy is oriented towards smooth developments. So that’s a question which we will have to deal with when the time comes. But we are not yet at that point.[end_answer] I am convinced that we have not yet arrived at a point where we need to conduct a public discussion on the exit.[end_answer] We had a detailed discussion on this matter in the early 2000s under the ECB’s chief economist at the time, Otmar Issing. We quickly and unanimously concluded that we should not have an inflation target of 0%. In that scenario we would tend to be deflation-oriented, not least because of statistical distortions in measuring prices. An economy therefore needs a little inflation in order to have a buffer. I don’t think much at all of unsettling our definition of price stability – just as I don’t think much of questioning our strategy, as we have seen in the discussion on price-level targeting.[end_answer] For ELA decisions we apply our rules strictly. This works both ways: I’d really feel the pain if we didn’t observe our rules. But of course we have to be careful that this step doesn’t lead to hidden monetary financing of governments. This risk increases if a country has no access to markets.[end_answer] The ECB’s Governing Council has not yet reached a conclusive opinion on that matter. For me, this is a dynamic process: the more a country – and a banking system – loses market access and the less likely it looks to regain it soon, the greater the risk of indirect monetary financing, and the stricter we have to be. Our response has been to observe the current situation very closely and promptly in order to prevent any circumvention of the ban on monetary financing. The supervisory arm also has a role to play here.[end_answer] We have to see how the situation develops. But I also uphold the applicable legislation.[end_answer] No, the rules are the same. At that time there was a programme, a cooperative government and the prospect of a successful review of the programme and its implementation. Currently, we are far from agreement. Promises alone are not enough. That applies especially when they are undermined in public.[end_answer] The figures have clearly got worse. That’s no surprise. It also shows how dangerous the crisis is if it leads to parties from the far ends of the political spectrum bearing responsibility which have no experience of government or of how Europe works. This then requires a period of adaptation in a phase when there is no time.[end_answer] Capital controls are alien to a monetary union and they should only be invoked in an emergency.[end_answer] We certainly have to keep an eye on the situation.[end_answer] If you have a chance to shape things, you don’t assume that the result will be an accident. Instead, you do everything to avoid an accident. That is our approach, and that is, I think, the approach throughout Europe. But one can also clearly say: we have our rules in Europe, and everyone must stick to them.[end_answer] I would of course prefer to have no country in the [excessive] deficit procedure and debt reduction going faster. But compared with other regions in the world, we are not doing that badly. However we have to do much more to raise our growth potential. To that end, structural reforms are urgently needed. In that respect every country – and I stress every country – still has a lot to do. Some countries are still not tackling the issue of an ageing population. But I don’t believe that we have basically said goodbye to a stability union. We still have the corresponding body of regulations. I would also be pleased to see that being applied in a more targeted way.[end_answer] It has been shown that common rules alone do not suffice to provide the necessary discipline. In my view, stronger institutions are therefore needed at European level, a deepening of the monetary union. The crucial question is then: what can we still do without changing the EU Treaty. I don’t see much room for manoeuvre there.[end_answer] I continue to stand by it: the euro has brought Europe a lot – economically and much more than that. I can only warn against allowing ourselves, as Europeans, to be divided. I’m glad that the political will exists in almost all countries to stand together. That also shows how strong the cement of cohesion via the single currency has become. It also makes me confident that together we can find a way out of this crisis.[end_answer] No. We are quite clearly in the unconventional area. That’s why these measures have a time limit. In the case of some of them the question will arise whether in future they should be a regular component of the “normal” tool box. As for our purchases of government bonds from euro area countries however, I don’t see that happening. Perhaps at some time there will be a new permanent monetary policy instrument for the ECB via a system of new European bonds. But I can’t imagine that without a change to the Treaty. In addition, I remain sceptical about the concept of secular stagnation.[end_answer] I don’t regard them as being justified over the long term either. We have taken these measures in order to return as soon as possible to our normal instrument, the positive key rate. Yet it’s structural reforms that should take us back to an economic environment with no negative real interest rates.[end_answer] No question about it: if we don’t manage to raise growth potential interest rates will not be able to rise in a sustainable way. That’s why it’s essential for policy-makers and business people to make the necessary adjustments. Rates at 0% are definitely not normal and shouldn’t be so. And that’s why the debate about higher levels of investment is so important.","['low return to an inflation', 'path of inflation', 'achieving inflation rates below', 'inflation expectations slumped', 'de-anchoring of inflation', 'inflation target']","['This forms the basis for our March projections, which envisage a slow return to an inflation rate that is close to our understanding of stable prices: accordingly, we shall be at 1', 'a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”', 'a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”', 'Also, inflation expectations slumped from 1', '4%, it was a free fall and there was a risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations', 'We quickly and unanimously concluded that we should not have an inflation target of 0%']",1949,M,Luxembourg,2012 - 2019,"['this form the basis for our March projection which envisage a slow return to an inflation rate that be close to our understanding of stable price accordingly we shall be at ', 'the Governing Councils decision refer to a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that be consistent with its aim of achieve inflation rate below but close to over the medium term ', 'I also distinguish between an undershooting of zero inflation which be mainly attributable to temporary phenomenon such as the price of oil and on which we can effectively have no influence and a general fall in the price level ', 'also inflation expectation slump from ', 'it be a free fall and there be a risk of a deanchoring of inflation expectation ', 'we be aware that it play an important role in inflation ', 'we quickly and unanimously conclude that we should not have an inflation target of ', 'in that scenario we would tend to be deflationoriente not least because of statistical distortion in measure price ', 'an economy therefore need a little inflation in order to have a buffer ']","['this form the basis for our March projection which envisage a slow return to an inflation rate that be close to our understanding of stable price accordingly we shall be at ', 'the Governing Councils decision refer to a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that be consistent with its aim of achieve inflation rate below but close to over the medium term ', 'I also distinguish between an undershooting of zero inflation which be mainly attributable to temporary phenomenon such as the price of oil and on which we can effectively have no influence and a general fall in the price level ', 'also inflation expectation slump from ', 'it be a free fall and there be a risk of a deanchoring of inflation expectation ', 'we be aware that it play an important role in inflation ', 'we quickly and unanimously conclude that we should not have an inflation target of ', 'in that scenario we would tend to be deflationoriente not least because of statistical distortion in measure price ', 'an economy therefore need a little inflation in order to have a buffer ']",9,9,12157,[],0,"['This forms the basis for our March projections which envisage a slow return to an inflation rate that is close to our understanding of stable prices accordingly we shall be at 1.8 in 2017.', 'The Governing Councils decision refers to a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term.', 'I also distinguish between an undershooting of zero inflation which is mainly attributable to temporary phenomena such as the price of oil and on which we can effectively have no influence and a general fall in the price level.', 'Also inflation expectations slumped from 1.8 to 1.4.

172,2015-03-25,Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore,Peter Praet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2015/html/sp150325.en.html,Information not found,"In the ECB latest projections, as in those of other forecasters, besides the upward revision of figures, there is a clear change of tone from “fairly gloomy” to more “upbeat”. What is happening in the euro area economy?[end_question] You have a fairly big jump in projections on growth, 0.5% or thereabouts for both 2015 and 2016, but what surprised some people in the markets was that you also expect inflation to pick up substantially between 2015 and 2016, going from 0% to 1.5%, and then to 1.8% in 2017. Some regard this as too optimistic.[end_question] Central banks normally tend to look through oil prices. Why did you have to act?[end_question] Now, a number of people, including quite a few members of the Governing Council, argue that with conditions improving anyway, and the oil price being a temporary phenomenon, that quantitative easing (QE) wasn’t really justified.[end_question] Where do you see the risks, now that QE has started and seems to be having a strong impact, especially on markets.[end_question] So QE may remove the urgency to undertake the reforms?[end_question] Is a weaker exchange rate the main channel through which QE will help the Italian economy?[end_question] In Italy a lot of people are starting to think we would be better off outside the euro.[end_question] What is your early assessment of the reforms, including the labour market reform, in Italy?[end_question] The fall of the euro has been the most visible consequence of QE. There is a disconnect between the state of the economy and monetary policy, especially in respect of the dollar. Will the Fed be “patient” about a further rise of the dollar?[end_question] But can you be accused of having started a currency war, given what other central banks have had to do to respond to your QE?[end_question] Have the TLTROs been obscured by QE?[end_question] Banks claim that while you tried to promote credit easing with your monetary policy, your supervisory arm, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), and the constant change in the rules makes this more difficult.[end_question] Negative interest rates have now become so widespread that they must be posing some risks and interfering with your macro scenario. You could reach your target sooner than expected.[end_question] Are you encouraging excessive risk-taking and therefore instability?","After two recessions, the first in 2009 and another in 2010-2011 as well as an aborted recovery, we had a stabilisation of economic conditions in the course of 2013 and an improvement in early 2014, but by the late spring we were seeing a slowdown in an already weak recovery. That’s why we decided on a number of measures between June and September/October, the so-called credit easing package. Then, in November, we saw that inflation was remaining weak and, in spite of the measures we had taken, that inflation expectations had become seriously destabilised. We flagged the risk of being trapped in a 1%/1% economy: 1% inflation, 1% growth. This would create a vicious circle: if everybody revised their inflation and growth expectations downwards then there would be less investment and a debt overhang. That is why we decided to take further measures in January. In spite of favourable conditions created by the oil price, there was a high risk that some of the benefits would be saved and so the full effect of the positive supply shock would be in doubt. We have always said that low oil prices have an ambiguous effect: positive, because energy is cheaper, but negative if they reinforce the deflationary behaviour of economic agents. In January we also thought that taking further measures when there are signs of a turning point would give a boost to the economy. We believed that doing it at that moment would put us back onto a growth trajectory, reducing the risk of the de-anchoring of inflationary expectations. It’s a combination of circumstances that we hope will help to support the economic recovery: the low price of oil, better financial conditions including the currency, a more neutral fiscal policy, and also the benefit of structural reforms in some countries. These effects are visible in Ireland, Spain and Portugal, where - although painful - reforms have created the basis for a solid recovery.[end_answer] The pickup in headline inflation is largely due to a base effect, namely the fact that the impact on annual inflation of the drop in the price of fuel and other goods influenced by the price of oil will disappear later this year. The gradual increase in the price of oil that markets expect to see over the projection horizon and which forms part of our assumptions will also give support to our headline inflation projections. The more relevant question is on core inflation when you take the price of food and energy out: this is now at 0.7%. It gets close to 2% in 2017, converging with headline inflation. The first element in the increase of core inflation is the pass-through of the exchange rate, which is the most important impact. The second source is the indirect effect of oil prices, for instance through transportation costs. Then we have the closing of the output gap, which might lead to firms regaining some pricing power. Most analysts have been discussing our assumption of the closing of the output gap by end of 2017. Some people argue that the output gap cannot be closed with such high unemployment. But the labour market can be tight in spite of massive unemployment if observed unemployment is all structural in nature. It’s difficult to say today, but we think there will be somewhat higher wage increases in 2017, in spite of a still high jobless rate, because we expect the structural component of unemployment to remain large in 2017. But the key assumption giving support to the projected inflation is not a vigorous pickup in wage costs – which in fact are going to remain moderate – but rather firms regaining pricing power. In the last year producer prices have been negative. Profits of firms have been under pressure not only because of volumes but also because of prices.[end_answer] As I said, there was uneasiness about the serious risks of de-anchoring in inflation expectations. Maintaining price stability is the core mandate of the ECB. In 2003 the ECB announced that, in order to avoid risks of deflation, inflation should be below but close enough to 2% in the medium term. If the ECB does not deliver on this pledge, at some point, this creates a problem of credibility. If the risk is increasing, we have to give a signal that we are ready to do what is necessary to counter it, given our mandate. In January we concluded that we were confronted with the risk of falling into deflation. The price of protection against deflation jumped. These dynamics were reversed after we took very forceful action. The switch in the projections reflects this: we were in negative dynamics, with people being very pessimistic about the long run. We tried to invert those dynamics by very strong signalling at a time when we had favourable conditions.[end_answer] Let me clarify two points. First, there was a large majority in the Governing Council. We tried not to be overly conditioned by the question of risk-sharing. We made a purely monetary policy decision, separate from the question of doing fiscal policy through the back door. What is important is that the central bank has signalled its willingness and ability to act, to use the instruments available. The discussion on “wait and see” is a fair one, but the collective judgement of the Governing Council was that it was time to act. Second, what you see in our projections – which indeed give us some grounds for comfort – is that a more robust recovery is under way – but that this is conditional on a full implementation of what we announced in January.[end_answer] The major risk is the risk of complacency. Take Italy, for example: the yields on 10-year government debt are at post-war lows, credit conditions are improving very fast, at the fastest pace in the euro area. It is clear that this additional, substantial amount of monetary accommodation will bring a lot of relief to the economy. But productivity in Italy stopped growing back in the mid-1990s, it was the worst performer among the large OECD countries, and in this long crisis, Italy has already had three recessions.[end_answer] It’s still a very challenging situation. The Italian economy, already debilitated by long-standing structural weaknesses, has gone through an accelerated downward trend and has underperformed other stressed economies, such as Ireland and Spain. This is now starting to be understood and we are seeing some structural reforms. But the implementation remains quite difficult. You have to communicate to people a sense of urgency and of ambition: reforms have to be done quickly and on a large scale. Implementation is key now. There is a long way to go. Monetary policy accommodation will help but will not make Italy a more productive economy.[end_answer] On the contrary. It’s a window of opportunity. Monetary policy accommodation facilitates the implementation of reforms. It’s a risk if governments look at the electoral cycle and think they can just benefit from some growth and stop the reforms. Will structural reforms depress demand again? That is totally wrong. One has to be careful in selecting the right structural interventions, in prioritising the measures to take. There is a very limited window in which to carry out the reforms.[end_answer] I would say it’s more the financial conditions, a factor which is broader than just the exchange rate. The Italian banking system was not exposed to sub-prime, but it is very exposed to the Italian economy and government debt. So there’s a local exposure to an economy that wasn’t growing even before the crisis. The financial sector entered the crisis already weak, with low profitability and high costs. It withstood the 2009 crisis, but when the sovereign debt crisis hit in mid-2011, and interest rates on government debt went to 7%, the sector’s large portfolios of Italian sovereign securities depreciated rapidly. At that point, as was to be expected, banks retrenched, tightening credit conditions for their customers. Financial conditions became very harsh for the real economy. It took a long time to improve. Even one year ago, rates were very high for an economy that had not been growing for years and was expected to stagnate in the future. Market discipline can move from too soft to too harsh. It was perhaps not enough in the past but then it became excessive. Governments should take measures to avoid a pro-cyclical financial loop that creates instability.[end_answer] Italy joined the euro because the previous regime, i.e. fixing the exchange rate and devaluing occasionally, was a source of uncertainty and instability. Markets learned how that regime worked, and therefore interest rates were constantly high, creating that snowball effect that brought Italy the very high public debt burden it has now. The country’s problem is that it entered monetary union with that high public debt and governments did not seize the opportunity offered by lower interest rates to reform the economy. Now the low interest rate environment and easier financial conditions are again facilitating the necessary reforms. It’s a window. I think this is understood: some reforms are in the pipeline. But as I said it’s always a matter of implementation.[end_answer] The so-called Jobs Act can be a very important building block in a bold reform agenda. In Spain a similar step was taken three years ago, and it was a key factor pushing the Spanish economy to generally outperform the rest of the euro area in 2014. As we have seen in Spain, the Jobs Act reform can make Italy a more attractive location for doing business. It can create new employment opportunities, reabsorb the unemployed and give more stable and better-paid jobs to those who seek work certainty. But, again, this should be the starting point of an ambitious agenda for economic reforms. It should not be the end of the efforts.[end_answer] Currencies will reflect fundamentals and that is basically what we have seen. I cannot comment further on the exchange rate movements. From the European point of view, the decline of the effective exchange rate has been relatively modest.[end_answer] We have received a lot of international support for our recent measures. We do it for domestic reasons. The IMF told us we should have done it faster, so it was no surprise for anybody. We did the credit easing first, which gave renewed incentives for banks to create credit for the real economy, but in terms of the quantity it was not sufficient. Inflation expectations were not rebounding, so we took a new set of measures.[end_answer] As I said, we have been positively surprised by the impact of our summer 2014 measures on the pricing of credit even before QE. What we now see is that those banks which participated in the first two operations in September and December last year have cut the price of their loans to households and companies by more than non-participating banks. They have a strong incentive to generate more loans because the advantageous borrowing conditions under the TLTROs are conditional on their actual loan flows. Also, the third tender last week went quite well in terms of volumes. So, the TLTROs are also playing an important role.[end_answer] The flood of changes in regulation has had a certain cyclical effect, which has been compensated by monetary accommodation. But there is no contradiction. You need to make banks safer, less leveraged, and reduce liquidity risk. It is a caricature to say that we squeeze the banks and then provide more liquidity. We want more resilient banks.[end_answer] I would be very cautious here about the implications of the early days of QE. You need to give the markets some time to settle and get used to our purchases of €60 billion per month. When we designed the policy we wanted to have a sustained path of inflation towards where it should be. It will take time to assess its impact.[end_answer] The people who said we may be in a deflationary spiral may be the same people who now say it’s too much. We’ll have a steady hand in implementation and we stick to the fact that a steady improvement in the outlook for price stability is conditional on us carrying out purchases at least until September 2016.[end_answer] We are coming from a situation in which the risk of financial instability came from inflation being permanently too low, possibly a deflation risk. A third recession would create huge financial stability problems. A shift in investment patterns by banks and other financial entities to longer-dated and riskier exposures is part of the policy of QE. Furthermore, in some countries some banks may have an excessive exposure to the sovereign. That creates a big correlation between the sovereign risk and the bank risk. Therefore, banks of the countries concerned could decide to reduce their exposure to the sovereign. Having said all this, we are monitoring financial markets constantly and with extreme care to detect pockets of exuberance.","['inflation was remaining weak', 'inflation expectations had become

187,2016-12-14,Interview with Die Zeit,Peter Praet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2016/html/sp161214.en.html,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Lisa Nienhaus and Mark Schieritz on 12 December and published on 14 December 2016",,"Mr Praet, you are a member of the Executive Board of the ECB and thus part of an international elite that is really hated by the new right-wing political movements. Do you feel threatened by that?[end_answer] Peter Praet: No, but I am worried. As a European institution, we look at how much people trust us. People like the euro, but the latest Eurobarometer survey shows that trust in the European institutions has strongly declined in recent years. This is true for the whole of Europe as well as for national institutions, not only for the ECB. But for us too.[end_answer] No wonder, when savers no longer get any interest![end_answer] That is not the reason. In recent years, i.e. during the period of low interest rates, the approval ratings have not changed significantly. The strong downturn came in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis. That is when trust plummeted. The reasons were, above all, economic. Before 2008 we, and most economists, predicted that the euro area would carry on growing continuously. But then came the recession following the financial crisis and we never reached the predicted economic strength. Shortly afterwards came the sovereign debt crisis, the second recession and the rescue programmes with their cutbacks. So expectations were raised much too high and could not be fulfilled. That is a great disappointment for many people.[end_answer] So everything is the fault of the financial crisis. The ECB itself has nothing to do with it?[end_answer] Central banks didn’t see the crisis coming at an early stage either. In the years before the financial crisis, credit growth was very high, not only in Europe, benefiting from relatively low interest rates in some countries. We gave several warnings at the time about the excessive liquidity in the markets. When the crisis then erupted, people realised that Europe was not properly prepared for a situation like this.[end_answer] What was missing?[end_answer] The toolkit was insufficient to respond to critical developments. There was no common banking supervision, there were no institutions for the stabilisation or resolution of banks, and there were no macroprudential instruments. That increased the effects of the crisis. Central banks have just one instrument to achieve price stability – the interest rate. It is difficult to counter a complex situation with this instrument alone. However, we have made good progress in stabilising the foundations of Monetary Union.[end_answer] The European elites did that too. But the people are clearly not happy with that. Ultimately, it comes down to the euro, without which there would be no problems. Was the euro itself a mistake?[end_answer] No. The crisis only illustrated that the euro had been created within an incomplete institutional framework. However, we should not forget what we owe to the euro. Before Monetary Union there were repeated economic shocks owing to strong fluctuations in exchange rates. That created trade barriers. In addition, you must always consider the alternative. Take Germany, for example: without the euro, the currency would have risen very strongly in value during the financial crisis. For a country that exports a lot, that is a problem. I rather doubt that the country would have been better off than it is now – and it is likely that interest rates would have been pushed down very strongly in this case too.[end_answer] At present everyone is saying that the elites have lived too long in their filter bubbles and did not notice the rise in populism. Does that apply to you too? Do you live in the ECB bubble?[end_answer] For us, diversity in opinions and views is an important basis for good decisions. On the ECB’s Governing Council, we have the 19 governors of the national central banks who are there in a personal capacity and not as representatives of their countries. That enriches the debate and our perspective on the world. And, conversely, they are also able to explain our decisions in their countries. We ourselves regularly go to the European Parliament, and occasionally national parliaments.[end_answer] For example, Mario Draghi spoke at the German Bundestag a few weeks ago.[end_answer] And you?[end_answer] I try to exchange views with different people as often as I can. For example, I’ve been to events for German small and medium-sized enterprises, and I take part in a lot of panels. Just recently I met the President of the Bavarian building societies, among others, in this way. Both sides learn from such events. The Germans are critical, but they are always polite, I find. Most people understand me better after such events. But usually they still don’t think that what we are doing is good.[end_answer] Do you sometimes meet tough critics? For example, members of Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party that came into being quite specifically as a protest against the euro rescue policy?[end_answer] We are open to dialogue with our critics. And we also engage in such dialogue on a regular basis, not least in the European Parliament.[end_answer] At the moment, interest rates are rising all around the world. Only the ECB is resisting the trend and is leaving interest rates low. Are you losing touch?[end_answer] The picture is not at all as uniform as you describe. In the United States, for example, the economic recovery is far more advanced than in the euro area, unemployment is lower and the rate of inflation is higher. That is why the US economy can cope with higher interest rates. We have not got that far yet.[end_answer] Why not? Unemployment is falling in Europe too, and there is growth – and the oil price is rising.[end_answer] It is true that the recovery is firming. However, the speed is still moderate and inflation is still some distance from a sustainable path back to the target value. That is why we have decided to extend our government bond purchase programme until the end of next year. We have, however, reduced the scale of the monthly purchases by €20 billion as of April.[end_answer] Is that the beginning of the exit from the trillion euro programme?[end_answer] No. We want to continue the level of monetary policy support that we have been administering to the European economy so far.[end_answer] So, what would have to happen for you to be prepared to exit?[end_answer] It would have to be apparent that there was a sustained convergence in the rate of inflation towards our objective of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.[end_answer] That can change quickly. In the financial markets it is expected that the US economy will receive a boost because Donald Trump wants to reduce taxes and increase public spending. Europe would also profit from that if we could export more.[end_answer] There are signs of a looser fiscal policy in the United States in future, which is expected to lead to higher growth rates. But that alone will not be enough. The important thing is to make the economy more productive. Another outstanding question is protectionism, which would of course be damaging, including for Europe. Trump is not President yet. We do not know exactly what he is planning, and we should therefore be cautious.[end_answer] So you want to continue flooding the world with money. You have already purchased bonds for over a trillion euro. At the end of the programme planned so far, it will be €2.3 trillion.[end_answer] We are not flooding anyone. People only ever talk about the billions of additional central bank money that we are making available. But hardly anyone mentions the fact that money and credit growth are fairly moderate. Our measures are thus aimed at stimulating this weak money and credit growth.[end_answer] How can that be explained to someone who is not a central banker?[end_answer] Both central banks and banks can create money through lending to the economy. If the banks are only doing so hesitantly, we can make financing conditions more attractive and so create incentives for more generous lending. As long as the overall money supply is not growing very quickly, that is not a cause for concern and does not lead to excessive inflationary pressures.[end_answer] That means you are doing everything right, but no one understands?[end_answer] I didn’t say that, but when interest rates reach zero, monetary policy becomes very complicated to explain. The central banks have not exhausted their options, but they have to resort to unconventional means, such as the purchase of government bonds.[end_answer] Here in Frankfurt, property prices have risen by 20% in one year. That is not very hard to understand. Is that the next crisis in the making?[end_answer] We follow developments in the financial markets very closely. In some regions we are indeed seeing a strong rise in property prices, but it is still not a Europe-wide phenomenon. Moreover, such a boom is only really dangerous when it is financed on credit. However, the issuance of building loans is only growing very slowly.[end_answer] In the event of a crisis, are you capable at all of responding in time? After all, countries like Italy are so highly indebted that they might not be able to cope with higher interest rates.[end_answer] I can take this worry off your shoulders. When the time for higher interest rates comes, then we will increase interest rates. The countries would also be able to cope with that. Many of them have used the period of lower interest rates to extend the maturities of their loans. When interest rates rise, that will not therefore lead immediately to a significant rise in the cost of servicing the debt. That does not mean that high debt levels are not a problem, but they do not restrict the ECB’s room for manoeuvre.[end_answer] Italy is already causing us concern today. The big problem is the ailing banks. The new Government is considering State aid. Does that make sense?[end_answer] The European rules permit that. Even Germany put public money into the banks at the height of the crisis. At that time, Italy did not. In my view, much more important than the question of where the money comes from is that there is a clear-out in the banking sector. There are too many banks in Italy and they are not profitable enough.","['inflation is higher', 'inflation is still some distance from', 'convergence in the rate of inflation']","['The picture is not at all as uniform as you describe.

What do you think the most important topic for discussion will be?[end_question] Negative rates are also hurting the financial industry…[end_question] What is the impact of your monetary policy on the real economy, so far?[end_question] Mario Draghi has insisted in his press conferences that fiscal policy and structural policy are also important, yet some European countries still continue to pursue austerity. Could you tell us your opinion on that?[end_question] What about foreign exchange policy? The UK pound and Japanese yen have been increasing and volatility is very high. What will the G7 do to reduce volatility?[end_question] Emerging markets are slowing down and advanced countries have very low growth rates. What should the G7 and advanced countries do for the world economy?","The Group of Seven (G7) countries are faced with a common challenge: how can they escape from this low growth, low inflation environment? What is important is that they cooperate and act together. To address future challenges, there needs to be a combination of multiple policies.[end_answer] In order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long, the ECB has brought short-term interest rates to levels close to zero or negative, and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance. We are also implementing quantitative monetary easing of €80 billion [about 10 trillion yen] per month at least until March 2017, primarily by purchasing government bonds but also, starting next month, by purchasing bonds issued by non-financial companies. These actions are mutually reinforcing and in particular negative rates are reinforcing the impact of QE.[end_answer] Negative interest rates impose direct costs on some industries: the banking industry, the pension funds industry and the insurance industry. But so far the overall impact on bank revenue has been positive, thanks to higher loan volumes and lower risk provisions. In addition, the money market in Europe has been functioning at negative rates for almost two years without any disruptions.[end_answer] The ECB is currently applying a -0.4% interest rate to money deposited by banks on their central bank account. It is in principle possible to cut this rate further, but there is currently no plan to do so. In March the ECB decided to lend money at a fixed rate over four years to banks which increase their loans to households and companies. We have a lending volume benchmark, and the rate will be as low as -0.4% for those banks which outperform their benchmark by a sufficient margin. We are convinced that these credit easing measures are even more important than the negative interest rate, even if they complement each other.[end_answer] This package of monetary easing policies is supporting short-term growth in a visible way. The European economy is coming back and recovering from the recession. But monetary policy cannot create long-term growth. Long-term growth will be driven by productivity gains, well-functioning economies and a reformed Economic and Monetary Union. It is the responsibility of the democratically elected governments to propose and implement the right reforms.[end_answer] As regards fiscal policy, the discussion in the G7 should not just be about increasing spending, it should also be about improving the quality of the budget. The ECB agrees with the idea that “countries that have fiscal space should use it”, but many countries do not have this fiscal space. Reducing unproductive expenditures and cutting taxes or increasing investment in productive infrastructure, such as education and research, can lead to growth without increasing the deficit.[end_answer] The G20 countries have committed not to use the exchange rate for competitive purposes, as confirmed in recent meetings in Shanghai and Washington. All of us should act in a way consistent with this commitment and which does not add to global uncertainty.[end_answer] In a low-growth environment globally, there might be a temptation for some countries to grow at the expense of other partner countries. So it is precisely the role of the G7 or the G20 to resist such temptation.[end_answer] There is no “magic bullet” for increasing growth. For the G7, it is crucial to send the message to support domestic demand and focus on those structural policies that will be most conducive to growth. You cannot just rely on other countries. The message that we would like to hear is that “growth starts at home”.","['low inflation', 'inflation from being too low']","['The Group of Seven (G7) countries are faced with a common challenge: how can they escape from this low growth, low inflation environment?', 'In order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long, the ECB has brought short-term interest rates to levels close to zero or negative, and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance.']",1969,M,France,2012 - 2019,"['the Group of Seven G country be face with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment ? what be important be that they cooperate and act together ', 'in order to prevent euro area inflation from be too low for too long the ECB have bring shortterm interest rate to level close to zero or negative and be provide forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance ']","['the Group of Seven G country be face with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment ? what be important be that they cooperate and act together ', 'in order to prevent euro area inflation from be too low for too long the ECB have bring shortterm interest rate to level close to zero or negative and be provide forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance ']",2,2,3703,"[('low', 'inflation'), ('inflation', 'prevent')]",2,"['The Group of Seven G7 countries are faced with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment?', 'In order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long the ECB has brought shortterm interest rates to levels close to zero or negative and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance.']",2,2,"['the group of seven g7 countries are faced with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment what is important is that they cooperate and act together', 'in order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long the ecb has brought shortterm interest rates to levels close to zero or negative and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance']","['other', 'orientation']","[True, True]","[('low', 'inflation'), ('inflation', 'prevent')]","['the group of seven g countries are faced with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment?', 'in order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long the ecb has brought shortterm interest rates to levels close to zero or negative and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance.']",2,"['orientation', 'orientation']",2,2,"['the group of seven g7 countries are faced with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment what is important is that they cooperate and act together', 'in order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long the ecb has brought shortterm interest rates to levels close to zero or negative and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance']","['other', 'disease']","['the group of seven g7 countries are faced with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment what is important is that they cooperate and act together', 'in order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long the ecb has brought shortterm interest rates to levels close to zero or negative and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance']","['other', 'disease']","['the group of seven g7 countries are faced with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment what is important is that they cooperate and act together', 'in order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long the ecb has brought shortterm interest rates to levels close to zero or negative and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance']","['other', 'orientation']","['other', 'disease']","[False, True]","[False, False]","[False, True]","[False, False]","[False, True]","[False, True]","[False, True]","[False, False]","[True, True]","[False, False]","[True, True]","[False, False]","[True, True]","[False, True]","[True, True]","[False, False]"
210,2016-04-28,Interview with Bild,Mario Draghi,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2016/html/sp160428.en.html,"Interview with Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, conducted by Kai Diekmann, Nikolaus Blome, Daniel Biskup on 25 April 2016 and published on 28 April 2016",,"BILD: Mr Draghi, when you became President of the European Central Bank (ECB) just over four years ago, the Germans were scared that, as an Italian, you would create too much inflation. Now, even an Italian is unable to generate sufficient inflation. What is going wrong?[end_answer] Mario Draghi (laughs): Nothing. People in Germany can rest assured that their ECB President is doing everything to restore inflation to the right level. Our mandate is price stability, which means inflation of just below 2%.[end_answer] BILD: In order to achieve that, you have cut interest rates to zero. German savings are melting away like butter in the sun. Don’t you care about that?[end_answer] Draghi: We are well aware of the situation for savers. And it’s not only in Germany that people have to face low interest rates. But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low. Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and it would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession. The interest on savings comes from growth, so it is in the interests of savers that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust. Besides, many people benefit from low interest rates as they are also homebuyers, taxpayers, entrepreneurs and workers whose companies are benefiting.[end_answer] BILD: In Germany the adverse effects are predominant. Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult…[end_answer] Draghi: Remember, what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms, i.e. interest minus inflation. This is higher today than it was on average in the 1990s. At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on yourSparbuch(savings account), but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still. So the interest looked good at first, but the real return was in fact much lower. Moreover, people can influence how much they get on their savings even in times of low interest rates. They don’t just have to keep the money in savings accounts but can invest in other ways. The Bundesbank has recently shown that the average return on all German household assets is close to 2%.[end_answer] BILD: So, are the German savers themselves to blame?[end_answer] Draghi: No. But there are alternatives when investing savings. In the United States savers had to face seven years of zero interest rates. The financial system – banks and insurers – nevertheless still worked. Money was invested in a variety of ways which in the end enabled a decent return.[end_answer] BILD: Of all people, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who has supported you for years, is now among your strongest critics, saying your policies are damaging savers and thereby strengthening populist parties. Does that get to you?[end_answer] Draghi: I don’t take anything personally in my job. A polite and constructive debate is actually welcome and helps us to explain our policies.[end_answer] BILD: Really?[end_answer] Draghi: Yes. But one thing is clear: the ECB obeys the law, not the politicians. Or, as one of my predecessors put it, it is normal for politicians to comment on our actions. But it would be abnormal if we listened to them.[end_answer] BILD: Does such criticism from the Finance Minister or from the German Vice Chancellor threaten the independence of the ECB?[end_answer] Draghi: No. But any perception that the ECB’s independence is under attack can unsettle businesses and consumers. They might then postpone investment and spending decisions that would be good for jobs and growth. That might force the central bank to do more to achieve price stability.[end_answer] BILD: Has the strength of the criticism from Germany also got something to do with the fact that you are an Italian, and what do you think of demands that the next President of the ECB must be a German?[end_answer] Draghi: There is really nobody in the world who is interested in the fact that I am an Italian apart from the German media. And what difference would it make if a non-Italian were now in office? None at all. He or she would pursue the same course as we do now. All other large central banks in the world are pursuing similar policies.[end_answer] BILD: But it is precisely this policy of cheap money that is not working…[end_answer] Draghi: Wrong – our policy is working, but we must be patient; investor confidence has not yet been fully restored. For two years, the economy in the euro area has been growing month by month, banks are lending and unemployment is steadily falling. Meanwhile, euro area countries are now able to buy more German exports again, which, for German companies, is partly making up for the decline in trade with China. But it is a slow process because the crisis was more severe than anything we’d had since the Second World War.[end_answer] BILD: And when will interest rates rise again?[end_answer] Draghi: It’s quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective. Low interest rates today will lead to higher rates tomorrow.[end_answer] BILD: Does the ECB’s policy of cheap money not make it far too easy for euro area countries like Italy and France, for example, to shirk necessary but unpopular reforms?[end_answer] Draghi: No. The majority of governments are acting, albeit too slowly for my personal taste. All of them would be well advised to do more. But that is not primarily dependent on the ECB and its policies. Most countries started to implement reforms when the level of interest rates was already very low. Furthermore, reforms of judicial systems, electoral laws or labour laws, for example, don’t have much to do with interest rates. So I don’t find the argument convincing that we have to keep up the pressure. It is also not our task. It would not be democratic for a central bank to dictate to elected governments what they have to do.[end_answer] BILD: Mr Draghi, in your first interview with BILD four years ago, we spoke a lot about Greece. The country has still not got back on its feet, even though it has received hundreds of billions in emergency loans. When will the madness end?[end_answer] Draghi: Clearly, last year was an economic setback for Greece. Now everyone is aware that there can be no growth without reforms. And what the country and its people need above all is growth. Greece has implemented many reforms in the past few months and is committed to the path of reform.[end_answer] BILD: Is the euro a part of the solution for Greece, or a part of the problem?[end_answer] Draghi: Greece’s challenges have little to do with the euro. It would have to implement reforms in any case. In the euro area, Greece can do that with the support of its partners. But one thing must be clear: who belongs in the euro area and who does not is not for the ECB to decide. That is a matter for the Member States.[end_answer] BILD: They are now more fractious than ever. Is that the biggest danger for Europe?[end_answer] Draghi: We are experiencing several crises which are all interconnected and reinforce each other. That makes it all the more important to resist every kind of nationalism or isolationism. Both are however on the rise. That worries me a lot.[end_answer] BILD: In the United Kingdom there will even soon be a vote on a complete withdrawal from the EU…[end_answer] Draghi: I cannot and do not wish to believe that the British would vote to leave, because we are stronger together. But if they do, it should be clear to them that they would lose all the benefits of the Single Market.[end_answer] BILD: If you had a spare wish for Chancellor Merkel, what would that be?[end_answer] Draghi: That she continues to fight for Europe.[end_answer] BILD: And one last question. The Bundestag has invited you again: will you go?[end_answer] Draghi: Of course. It will be my pleasure.","['create too much inflation', 'generate sufficient inflation', 'restore inflation', 'inflation is too low', 'unleash deflation', 'inflation stabilises', 'inflation rate that was higher', 'inflation rises']","['BILD: Mr Draghi, when you became President of the European Central Bank (ECB) just over four years ago, the Germans were scared that, as an Italian, you would create too much inflation', 'Now, even an Italian is unable to generate sufficient inflation', 'People in Germany can rest assured that their ECB President is doing everything to restore inflation to the right level', 'But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low', 'Think about the alternative: if we raised rates now, it would be bad for the economy and it would unleash deflation, unemployment and recession', 'The interest on savings comes from growth, so it is in the interests of savers that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust', 'At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on yourSparbuch(savings account), but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still', 'Draghi: It’s quite simple: when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective']",1947,M,Italy,2011 - 2019,"['BILD Mr Draghi when you become President of the European Central Bank ECB just over four year ago the Germans be scared that as an italian you would create too much inflation ', 'now even an italian be unable to generate sufficient inflation ', 'People in Germany can rest assure that their ECB President be do everything to restore inflation to the right level ', 'our mandate be price stability which mean inflation of just below ', 'but interest rate be low because growth be low and inflation be too low ', 'think about the alternative if we raise rate now it would be bad for the economy and it would unleash deflation unemployment and recession ', 'the interest on saving come from growth so it be in the interest of saver that inflation stabilise and growth become more robust ', 'interest minus inflation ', 'at that time you might have have a high interest rate on yoursparbuchsaving account but we often have an inflation rate that be high still ', 'BILD and when will interest rate rise again ?

213,2016-03-18,Interview with La Repubblica,Peter Praet,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2016/html/sp160318.en.html,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Ferdinando Giugliano and Tonia Mastrobuoni on 15 March 2016 and published on 18 March 2016","Can you explain why you took such a big package of measures last Thursday?[end_question] Were you surprised by the strength of the market reaction?[end_question] But do you think the market is right to believe there will not be more cuts?[end_question] So you haven't reached the lower bound?[end_question] On corporate bonds purchases: would this instrument be accessible for companies like, let's say, Volkswagen?[end_question] Don't you think you are entering the dangerous territory of choosing who to distribute money to? For example, you may end up favoring larger companies.[end_question] Can we put it like this: in countries like Germany and France with big companies with high ratings, you are helping with corporate bond purchases, and in countries like Spain or Italy, with less access to this type of measure, you will help via the TLTRO?[end_question] On the TLTRO, some say it is not going to make much difference, because the problem is the demand, not the supply of credit.[end_question] Don't you think that the discussion in Germany about how harmful the accommodative stance of the ECB is lacks some analysis on some wrong business models, for example the one of the Sparkassen?[end_question] The staff projections don’t include the impact of the new measures. What will be the impact on inflation and growth of the package?[end_question] Can I ask you about what’s left in the toolbox? Could we see ‘helicopter drops’?[end_question] But in principle the ECB could print cheques and send them to people?[end_question] In Germany, the biggest economy in Europe, there is a very distortive discussion about the ECB. Aren’t you worried that this discussion is very dangerous to maintain trust within the eurozone?[end_question] Italy is often accused of not doing enough to solve its structural problems. What are the changes that could really unlock growth in Italy?[end_question] One thing you haven’t mentioned is fiscal policy. In Rome one often hears the argument that Italy should be allowed to expand fiscal policy more to really help the recovery. One also hears that the European fiscal rules are not fit for purpose. How do you respond to that?[end_question] Do you think there should be a haircut on Greek debt?[end_question] Who is stopping the third pillar of the banking union?[end_question] Do you accept the argument that one needs to find ways to limit risks in the banking sector?[end_question] Even this small deposit guarantee scheme is a big political problem for Germany.[end_question] But the Germans have a roadmap: they say government bonds must not be risk-free and that they want a common bankruptcy law. These are very difficult conditions.[end_question] A final question on Brexit. Do you have any contingency plans in place at the ECB?","You have to put these decisions in the context of heightened risks to our price stability objective. External shocks, mainly originating from emerging markets, high market volatility and the crucial need to avoid second-round effects warranted a strong and comprehensive package to counteract these adverse forces.[end_answer] We don’t have a gloomy assessment of the economy, domestic conditions have improved, financial conditions have clearly improved. But it is still very fragile, and external shocks can easily trigger a vicious circle, with further downward pressure on inflation. We wanted to ensure that this did not happen, in line with our mandate. It was decided by the vast majority in the Governing Council, that we had to act very forcefully to ensure an even more accommodative monetary policy stance.[end_answer] What can be said about the composition of the measures? We discussed the pros and cons of the different measures. On the negative deposit rate: it is clear that it served us very well in the past, it has been quite efficient in easing financial conditions, including the exchange rate, as a natural by-product of differences in the monetary policy stance in the major currency areas. As we proceeded on the path of negative interest rates on our deposit facility, it was also clear we had to look at the impact on the profitability of the banks. Banks are very important for the monetary transmission mechanism, so you have to look at what is the impact of the package on the banking sector. Against this background, we decided in favour of a package which still made use of changes in the ECB interest rates but increased the weight of measures aimed at credit easing.[end_answer] Since the markets had already anticipated three cuts in the deposit rate this year many money markets traders had to turn their positions. However, with a little bit more time to scrutinize and digest the complex package, markets and analysts finally tuned again.[end_answer] I expected that the short end was going to be repriced but that the rest of the package would dominate. Looking through some volatility, what we have got at the end makes sense from an economic point of view. Basically, we had a substantial impact on credit markets, which is good as financial conditions were worsening and credit spreads were going up. What dominated was very much the TLTRO and the broadening to corporate bonds of the asset purchases.[end_answer] In terms of other asset prices, I believe markets are very conscious already that the monetary policy courses of the major world currency areas remain quite on different trajectories as they reflect fundamentally different domestic underlying conditions. As we have said few times in the past, the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies will become ever more evident in the near future.[end_answer] In the Introductory Statement we said very clearly that we “expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at presentor lowerlevels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.[end_answer] No, we haven't. As other central banks have demonstrated, we have not reached the physical lower bound. This re-composition of the tool-box does not mean that we have thrown away any of our tools. If new negative shocks should worsen the outlook or if financing conditions should not adjust in the direction and to the extent that is necessary to boost the economy and inflation, a rate reduction remains in our armoury.[end_answer] Yes, as long as they have investment grade. You have corporate bonds in other sectors too, such as utilities, insurance, telecommunications, energy.[end_answer] Normally what you do is that you give liquidity to the bank in exchange of collateral. Here, you take a direct exposure. The other point is, you want to avoid influencing relative prices. We asked the committees to work on the specific definition of the bonds we will buy. We could buy something that is close to the index, but excluding banks, so that we avoid price distortions in the corporate bond market. The important point is that if the price goes up because you are buying non-financial corporations, there will be search for other bonds by the markets participants so they will rebalance the portfolio with other bonds that are not in our portfolio. So the initial effect of our purchases will spread further and the market can still function.[end_answer] It is true that in some jurisdictions you do not have many corporate bonds. But as I just said: the initial effect of our purchases will spread to other assets and other markets. So there will be a reinvestment of the liquidity. Those having sold corporate bonds will rebalance by buying other things. Some people will question the need for such a measure. They are right in saying that the situation is not dramatic, but I would stress that it is still fragile. Yes, we can see that the situation is improving, as, for example, unemployment is coming down. But we have not reached the 'escape velocity' yet where the rocket is not bound by gravity anymore.[end_answer] As shown by our Bank Lending Survey, credit demand is picking up and you also see from actual bank credit growth that the numbers are improving. So we now give a push for these developments to proceed and maybe to accelerate. Do not overlook the following: In the last tranches of the TLTRO I you could borrow for less and less time, as the loans had all the same maturity, that is September 2018, in an environment where the rates were falling. This time it's different: in one year[1]you can still borrow for four years at the conditions prevailing at that time. And, banks can benefit from a negative rate as low as our deposit facility rate if they meet the thresholds for credit growth. All this is quite bold. It will certainly facilitate cheaper funding of banks by replacing more expensive funding instruments by our TLTRO II.[end_answer] What we experience in the banking sector is difficult and we have to be very attentive to that, but it is also true that the banks have to rethink their activities fundamentally. I mention here digitalization, which is a very big challenge for the banks. It has the potential to change the business model fundamentally. The interest rate is not a favourable factor, but it is one of the factors. And as long as you have a positive impact on the economy from negative rates, you have better growth, fewer NPLs, so we have seen positive factors for banks. The problem for banks is not 2016, it is the medium term, if the situation becomes persistent and the business model is not adjusted, then profitability becomes a major issue.[end_answer] The measures we took should bring us close to the 2 per cent target at the end of 2018. But don't forget, the measures we take like the APP are supposed to remain in place as long as inflation has not reached a sustainable adjustment in the path of inflation. It must be sustainable. We are not yet there. In the forward guidance we said: we expect the interest rates to be low or lower for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases, which currently have an horizon to at least March 2017.[end_answer] There has been a lot of skepticism recently about monetary policy, not only in delivering but in saying ‘your toolbox is empty’. We say, ‘no it’s not true’. There are many things you can do. The question is what is appropriate, and at what time. I think for the time being we have what we have, and it is not appropriate to discuss the next set of measures.[end_answer] Yes, all central banks can do it. You can issue currency and you distribute it to people. That’s helicopter money. Helicopter money is giving to the people part of the net present value of your future seigniorage, the profit you make on the future banknotes. The question is, if and when is it opportune to make recourse to that sort of instrument which is really an extreme sort of instrument.[end_answer] There are other things you can theoretically do. There are several examples in the literature. So when we say we haven’t reached the limit of the toolbox, I think that’s true.[end_answer] I think the responsibilities for the problems we have are collective. I think everyone has to look from the point of view of the other. Don’t forget, a lot of excess German savings went to Spain, to the Spanish banking system. I don’t deny that the problem in creditor countries gets worse in some respects the lower we cut the deposit rate. It is true we are looking at this, and it is true that when we decided some recomposition of our toolbox, we took that into account. But, fundamentally, the issue is not so much the negative rates, the main issue is mistrust in the willingness of the more indebted countries to really seize this opportunity to forcefully address the problems. This is much more what drives the German view.[end_answer] The real question is ‘what drives prosperity?’ I think prosperity is linked to education, productivity, the rule of law, property rights and all these things, certainly not monetary policy. In Italy productivity really started to stop growing in the early 1990s. I think this is a fundamental reflection for the country. Some key questions like the efficiency of the judicial system, the labour market reforms, liberalizations in services, have in all or in part been tackled. But I think the agenda remains unfortunately significant. To give you just a few examples, I have been worried by the insufficient spreading of ICT technology. Business investment is recovering everywhere, because demand is recovering so investment is following, but one of the weaker investment performances is in Italy. I think the minister of finance and the government are well aware of what the priorities are, of what needs to be done.[end_answer] Experience tells that there is always a reason to postpone fiscal savings and that fiscal policy is often procyclical.[end_answer] So the only appropriate response to these experiences is having suitable fiscal rules and following them over the full cycle. Yes, there is the risk of doing the wrong things. For example, in 2011, not necessarily mentioning Italy but focusing on the European level, consolidation was necessary. However, the composition could have been more growth friendly. Instead of raising taxes, spending could have been cut, and instead of cutting investment in infrastructure, government consumption growth could have been reduced. And particularly in the current juncture, investment should not be penalized but encouraged in countries like Italy.[end_answer] Fiscal consolidation is always a lot about composition, about timing. Successful consolidation could involve pension reforms, which spread consolidation through the years. In this respect, in the past Italy went a long way to improve fiscal sustainability through its pension reform.[end_answer] I know in Italy there is a discussion over a coordinated tax reduction. What I see is that fiscal policy was slightly expansionary last year and will be this year. Well-designed structural reform packages, which entail short-term costs and have a clear impact on growth potential, are taken into account by the Commission and they may affect temporarily the adjustment toward the achievement of fiscal objectives. But of course the lower fiscal adjustment has to be commensurate to the beneficial impact of reforms on the growth potential and the sustainability of public finances.[end_answer] If you look at the wealth improvement of Greece in terms of disposable income, before the crisis it was spectacular and then it went the other way very quickly. So it was basically on shaky grounds, a large current account deficit, it borrowed money, so at some point it corrected. All this makes you very cautious to say we just do this or that and support the recovery in the absence of a very convincing programme of reforms. Greece was the extreme case, the demonstration that the monetary union was unprepared to deal with a financial cycle correction, especially in some countries. Fortunately, new institutions have been put in place, such as the European Stability Mechanism, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Single Resolution Mechanism. But we are not there yet, the banking union is not a real banking union yet.[end_answer] It is always the same problem. All will accept it, if they can trust the other members of this mutualized system to address what they think are risks.[end_answer] Yes, but the question is how you define that. That’s where the differences are. The single deposit guarantee has rarely been called and only for very small institutions. There is plenty of bail-inable assets before you reach small deposits. This deposit guarantee for me is something which distracts. We should do it. We could take the risk of having this guarantee.[end_answer] A common deposit insurance would help, but it's more important to allow a European bank to be able to operate in the euro area as a single entity.[end_answer] I think personally you should announce an objective and a roadmap. We have a roadmap for the deposit guarantee scheme, but it is very far away. We have to spell out on paper what we consider as required conditions before you can mutualise in, for example, 5 years. That would create a new environment for banking.[end_answer] As for sovereign debt, we have learnt from the crisis that it is not risk-free, that is clear. On the other hand, sovereign debt plays an important role in our economy, in the financial sector. So one needs a very thorough reflection on this. That’s why the sustainability of public finances is key. That’s why one can’t just say ‘let’s lower taxes and the economy will follow and we will self-finance the tax cut’. I think one needs to be careful as sovereign debt is a key pillar of our financial system.[end_answer] Brexit is part of this tendency for some to say that independent nations can do it better than collective solutions. I am confident that the voters will understand that national solutions are worse, that we have to reinforce Europe and not the opposite.[end_answer] [1]This has been updated to correct an editorial mistake in an earlier version.","['pressure on inflation', 'boost the economy and inflation', 'inflation has not reached', 'path of inflation']","['But it is still very fragile, and external shocks can easily trigger a vicious circle, with further downward pressure on inflation.', 'If new negative shocks should worsen the outlook or if financing conditions should not adjust in the direction and to the extent that is necessary to boost the economy and inflation, a rate reduction remains in our armoury.', 'But don´t forget, the measures we take like the APP are supposed to remain in place as long as inflation has not reached a sustainable adjustment in the path of inflation.', 'But don´t forget, the measures we take like the APP are supposed to remain in place as long as inflation has not reached a sustainable adjustment in the path of inflation.']",1949,M,Belgium,2011 -

How should we respond to this frustration?[end_question] Why are the ECB and the national central banks ignoring bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, which are being increasingly used for trade?[end_question] And if tomorrow the future President of the ECB was a German national, would that be a serious matter?","We’ve decided to halve our asset purchases. From January to September 2018 we will buy €30 billion worth of bonds per month instead of €60 billion, as at present. And our interest rates will remain unchanged. The ECB’s monetary policy will remain very accommodative: in particular, our asset purchases will continue until inflation clearly moves towards 2%. This recalibration takes account of the solidity of the recovery and allows it to gain strength. I am hopeful that this will be the last extension.[end_answer] We are aware that this policy could create risks on the financial markets. But its first effect is to further stimulate consumption and investment, and to support the fall in unemployment. There’s no financial bubble at euro area level. There are price tensions on real estate markets in some countries. In France, corporate debt is also rising very quickly, perhaps too quickly. But nothing at this stage demands action from the ECB.[end_answer] The ECB’s policy will enable households and firms to continue borrowing at historically low levels. The short-term rates set by the ECB are going to remain very low for quite some time, well past September 2018. As for long-term rates, they are set by the financial markets. These rates can be expected to rise as the global economic recovery proceeds. Businesses and governments must prepare for that.[end_answer] In Europe wages have tended to stand still because we’ve endured one blow after another, the financial crisis, then the euro area crisis. One young person in five is unemployed in the euro area. It’s no surprise that this affects wages. The nature of the jobs created has also changed. There are many fixed-term and part-time jobs which keep employees in a position of dependence. As the recovery takes hold, the quality of jobs will improve and allow wages to rise, but this will take time.[end_answer] It’s not the ECB’s job to give lectures. Our mandate is to protect the purchasing power of the people of Europe. Growth has returned in all the euro area countries and consumer confidence across Europe is at its highest for 16 years. The priority now is to achieve greater convergence between the countries and thus create a more resilient economic bloc. Every country must continue with its reforms: in particular France, but also Germany.[end_answer] It will enable France to make up for lost time. The return of growth in Europe is offering France a unique opportunity to pursue a coherent set of reforms in order to rectify its weaknesses: persistent unemployment, inadequate training, deficits in public finance and external trade. But this is happening at a time when globalisation and technological change are creating uncertainty. More flexibility is needed, it’s true, but we shouldn’t forget those who get left behind by this model.[end_answer] On the budgetary front, France still faces a predicament. Its deficit is falling, but mainly because the economy is growing again. If the economic climate changes, where will the room for manoeuvre be? It’s now high time that France, the second-largest economy in the euro area, let go of the ECB’s monetary policy.[end_answer] That’s a matter for the heads of state and government. For a long time I have favoured the establishment of a euro area finance ministry. Provided it was given the right financial tools, this would facilitate the handling of the next crisis without having to rely excessively on the ECB, which was mainly the case these past few years. But for the ministry to come into being, a degree of trust has to be recreated between the countries. In this discussion, the reforms and the serious nature of France’s budget are a test case. Let’s also prevent the common budget from absolving governments of their budgetary responsibilities.[end_answer] I am not one of those who think that Europe should get rid of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF was there when Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus were under attack. In an unstable world, the IMF is more necessary than ever. Our crisis management tool, the European Stability Mechanism, deserves to be strengthened. It could become a true European stability fund, with greater resources and an independent advisory capacity. European crises would also have to be managed in a more transparent way, involving the European Parliament more closely.[end_answer] Europe was a great success when it came to building the single market and the euro, and welcoming the former Communist countries. But it was unable to help workers facing globalisation and technological change. We need to take advantage of the return of growth to create a space for European rules which foster the mobility of employees, protect their rights and enable them to be educated and trained across Europe.[end_answer] We aren’t ignoring them. At the moment crypto-currencies don’t pose any monetary risk because the amounts involved are marginal. They are speculative financial instruments which create risks of a financial or even criminal nature.

After a brilliant start and major achievements, the Community is now in a crisis. Can it be overcome, do you think?[end_question] What has to be done now?[end_question] Some examples?[end_question] The world is less safe because of politicians such as Trump, Putin and Erdogan. Shouldn’t this make people think again?[end_question] One of the biggest challenges is populism, which takes aim at the EU in many ways. How can we convince people that populism will lead to our undoing?[end_question] Given the current mood, do you still see any opportunities for further steps towards integration?[end_question] Now that the euro area has wriggled its way out of the crisis, things are improving economically.[end_question] Is the upturn a result of the ECB’s low interest rate policy?[end_question] If there had been no intervention, what would have happened?[end_question] And yet, the ECB’s role remains controversial and its expansionary monetary policy heavily criticised.[end_question] But you are now facing the challenge of finding a way out of the expansionary monetary policy. This includes an increase in interest rates, as has just happened in the US. Is the Fed’s step a signal for the ECB?[end_question] Inflation in Germany is over 2%. Shouldn’t that be taken into account and the low interest rate policy, which has a serious cost for German savers, be brought to an end?[end_question] But the low interest rate policy is creating market distortions, as we see in Germany’s housing market. Aren’t there dangers looming?[end_question] The UK’s exit from the EU now lies ahead. Could Brexit endanger the financial stability of the euro area?[end_question] But there could also be winners. Frankfurt could become the EU’s largest financial centre. Do you agree?[end_question] What’s needed to complete it?[end_question] How optimistic are you then that the banking union can be completed before the next financial crisis?[end_question] What does it mean that some banks are withdrawing from the European market and focusing on their domestic market? That there’s no European banking system after all?","The people of the European Union (EU) have got so used to the benefits of open borders and the Single Market that they can no longer imagine what it was like before or what it would be like without it. They live in a stable world and are not always aware that it’s a great asset, and one that needs to be preserved.[end_answer] We have to re-convince people that the EU market, with more than 500 million people, forms the basis for our prosperity. When we laid the foundation for it in 1992 with the Maastricht Treaty, the EU was a grouping of relatively homogeneous states. However, as a result of the enlargement, countries were integrated [into the EU] which had much lower income levels or much weaker social safety nets. This has led to distortions which we have to address.[end_answer] There can be no doubt that trade and a larger market foster prosperity. But we should not overlook the fact that this progress does not benefit everyone to the same extent. This may lead to resentment. Such feelings cannot simply be brushed aside; people’s concerns have to be taken seriously. Moreover, the enlargement was linked to the expectation that the Community would continue to come together and that people’s circumstances would steadily improve. This has happened for many, but not for all. Also, the financial crisis which occurred at the start of the recession in 2009 has led to a crisis of credibility. So there are reasons for many people to feel discontent. On the other hand, the EU is willingly used as a scapegoat. Some find this a cheap way to distract from national problems, such as undesirable developments on the labour market, in social security systems or in debilitating bureaucracies.[end_answer] We have been able to progress peacefully for a long time under the protection of the United States. We have set ourselves up in a multilateral world. But the old world order is being challenged. In the worst-case scenario, there is a risk that power and size will matter above all. In such a system the great powers, the US, Russia and China, would dominate. The voices of smaller countries would lose their relevance if they act in isolation. And let’s face it, even the biggest European countries fall into this category if left to their own devices. If we want to protect our interests and our conception of how we want to live together, then we have to stand together. And that’s only possible through the EU.[end_answer] We are seeing mistrust in and scepticism about the elites. All too often, problems and grievances, which of course exist in our societies, are no longer being addressed in order to seek the right solutions, but are becoming the expression of a general rejection. Populists promise supposedly simple solutions which are, at the same time, specious and ultimately harmful. How can you take a stand against them? First of all, you should listen and take people’s concerns seriously, because it’s essential to consider carefully the real and supposed grievances and, if possible, resolve them. Lastly, it’s necessary to explain the consequences of political action: if people vote for populists who idealise the nation state and make its sovereignty absolute, then those voters have to know that, although they would live in smaller, easier-to-control markets, it would also mean much higher prices for consumers and reduced prosperity. Basically, as I see it, people vote for populists in order to protest, but not to reject the EU as such.[end_answer] Yes, we are working on a deepening of the Single Market to facilitate free trade. For example, if the EU harmonises the performance of vacuum cleaners, then they can be marketed right across Europe, in addition to being a factor in energy efficiency. But people see this as “Brussels” wanting to impose a diktat, as almost some kind of “harassment”. Harmonisation cuts the cost of our products, which would otherwise have to be adjusted separately for each national market. So when the talk is about a deeper EU, greater harmonisation and fewer barriers to trade, then inevitably that is at the expense of the Member States’ freedom to decide. But in areas where national or even regional institutions are better suited to establish the right rules, then the principle of subsidiarity should be applied to a greater extent. It’s not about integration as a valueper se, but about integration that’s appropriate and necessary. I think there is the necessary consensus on this point.[end_answer] Things are getting better but the economic situation still varies a lot. Germany, which has weathered the crisis well because of the low level of government debt and household debt, is in a very good position. But other countries were severely hit and still have some serious challenges. The good news is that the recovery is firming up in all the countries of the euro area and expanding into more and more sectors. Consumer and business confidence is rising, despite all the political uncertainties. That’s encouraging. After all the years of crisis progress is being made and people have trust in it.[end_answer] In 2009 we had the biggest recession in the post-war era, with a sharp increase in unemployment. Since that low more than four million new jobs have been created in the euro area. Our monetary policy has supported the recovery as it has made financing conditions for banks and thus also for households and businesses easier. But let us take a step back and consider the economic slump. The sovereign debt crisis resulted from it and caused the countries to fall into a recession again in 2011 and 2012. The ECB’s monetary policy and its intervention played a decisive stabilising role. It averted a depression.[end_answer] To give an example: if the ECB had not given the Spanish banks liquidity assistance in 2012, when a lot of money was withdrawn, capital controls would have resulted and creditors from other euro area countries would have found it difficult to gain access to their assets. People have forgotten just how dangerous the situation was at that time. Many are unaware that the ECB and governments too acted in a carefully considered, reasonable way and prevented a worse outcome. The European institutions were not at all prepared for such a crisis, which is why decisions were also quite chaotic at the outset. But in the end, also thanks to the creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a collapse of the Single Market was prevented.[end_answer] The ECB has played a leading role, not least because of the fact that it was capable of acting at any time during the crisis. The decisions were never simple and there was much discussion about the right course to follow. But at the ECB we were always aware of our responsibility and managed to craft a monetary policy supported by all members of the Governing Council. This paid off during the crisis. But this success has been double-edged: the ECB has not only had to repeatedly take on new tasks, such as banking supervision. But also it is being held responsible for problems the more it is seen as an especially influential European institution that can take action. This is the case even if in reality it is not responsible.[end_answer] We have a clear mandate and it relates to the euro area. And we have to watch developments closely before we take action. So far, we can only say that the economic situation is improving. That gives us confidence, but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus. While inflation is temporarily close to the desired target, it is based to a large extent on short-term fluctuations in energy prices. The underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak, and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way.[end_answer] We are indeed very aware of the criticism – and by the way it exists in other countries – and we take it seriously. Of course, interest rates could be higher for Germany’s economy and in some other countries as well, if they were alone. But they aren’t – we have a single currency. Therefore, the ECB is committed to conducting a monetary policy for the euro area as a whole, and sometimes that requires everyone to be patient. As always, there are some for whom monetary policy is too loose, while others would specifically like to see more support. But let’s not forget the times before monetary union, when we had fluctuating exchange rates, which brought a lot of instability. That was very costly for economies such as Germany’s. Today, by way of our monetary policy, we are contributing to the continued existence, stability and functioning of the Single Market. That’s really important for Member States that are major exporters. And that’s even more relevant in times when free trade is being called into question internationally.[end_answer] The price increases should be seen in context. They were preceded by an unusually long period of stagnating house prices in Germany. This has changed in the last seven years. And the question now arises as to whether there is some overheating. That may be the case in the most popular cities, but overall there are no clear signs of that. A dangerously speculative, destabilising overheating would, moreover, only occur if the price rises were being increasingly and excessively financed by credit. One would see that from strongly growing home loans, but which is not the case. And if it got to that point, then it would not in the first place be the task of monetary policy to react, as its primary commitment is to price stability. But there are other means available to national governments and supervisory authorities to curb overheating, should a worst-case scenario arise. For instance, by tightening the rules on lending or via fiscal policy.[end_answer] No, I don’t think that Brexit poses a risk to financial stability. First, it will be a thoroughly controlled exit and, second, we have learnt from the crisis how to handle dangerous situations. One must always be concerned about stability should there be abrupt events which have an immediate impact. But with the UK’s expected exit this is precisely not the case. We will have time to organise the break and the related adjustment. And from a purely organisational perspective the adjustment brings for the regulators such as the supervisory authorities an enormous amount of work. What concerns me are the massive costs that the withdrawal will cause for the EU27 and, above all, for the UK.[end_answer] Frankfurt is a friendly place, multinational, well-organised and convenient. The city offers a good working environment. I value that, as do some private sector bankers. But no doubt you could say that about Madrid, Dublin, Paris or other European cities. In my view, what matters is something different: if the financial centres of the euro area hope to play a more prominent role, then they will have the best chance of doing so only in the context of a fully fledged European banking union. And there’s no point in hoping for that in some distant future. We need a strong and complete banking union within the next four to five years.[end_answer] We need a clear road map, showing where we want to be in four or five years’ time. Brexit is regrettable and harmful, but it is also an opportunity for the banking union. Having a strong and reliable regulatory framework and a single supervisory body that is both strict and fair are big competitive advantages in the banking sector – for that creates trust of a sustainable kind, the bankers’ most important “currency”.[end_answer] Banks are now much better capitalised than before the crisis. Furthermore, the supervisory authorities have also learnt to respond quickly to avert risks to financial market stability. A bankruptcy like that of Lehman Brothers in 2008 is much less likely nowadays. The banks protect themselves as well by making better provisions.[end_answer] I am also concerned about that, because we in the monetary union need cross-border banks which are subject to common supervisory and resolution rules. When there is common banking supervision, you also need burden-sharing in case something goes wrong. We don’t have that at the moment. We indeed have common supervision, but if something starts keeling over, the individual states still have to step in. We won’t have a banking union with real risk sharing until we have a common backstop, i.e. a credit line from the European Stability Mechanism, for instance.","['normalisation of inflation', 'inflation is temporarily close to the desired target', 'inflation trend']","['That gives us confidence, but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus', 'While inflation is temporarily close to the desired target, it is based to a large extent on short-term fluctuations in energy prices', 'The underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak, and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way']",1949,M,Belgium,2011 - 2019,"['that give we confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation be still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus ', 'while inflation be temporarily close to the desire target it be base to a large extent on shortterm fluctuation in energy price ', 'the underlying inflation trend be still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way ']","['that give we confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation be still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus ', 'while inflation be temporarily close to the desire target it be base to a large extent on shortterm fluctuation in energy price ', 'the underlying inflation trend be still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way ']",3,3,12543,[],0,"['That gives us confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus.', 'While inflation is temporarily close to the desired target it is based to a large extent on shortterm fluctuations in energy prices.', 'The underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way.']",3,3,"['that gives us confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus', 'while inflation is temporarily close to the desired target it is based to a large extent on shortterm fluctuations in energy prices', 'the underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way']","['orientation', 'other', 'disease']","[True, True, True]",[],[],0,"['other', 'orientation', 'orientation']",3,3,"['that gives us confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus', 'while inflation is temporarily close to the desired target it is based to a large extent on shortterm fluctuations in energy prices', 'the underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way']","['orientation', 'orientation', 'orientation']","['that gives us confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus', 'while inflation is temporarily close to the desired target it is based to a large extent on shortterm fluctuations in energy prices', 'the underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way']","['orientation', 'orientation', 'disease']","['that gives us confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus', 'while inflation is temporarily close to the desired target it is based to a large extent on shortterm fluctuations in energy prices', 'the underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way']","['orientation', 'other', 'disease']","['orientation', 'orientation', 'orientation']","[True, True, True]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, True]"

Was there ever a moment when you thought that maybe the euro wasn’t such a good idea after all?[end_question] But there were some very severe crises. In 2012, for example, when the risk premia for Spanish and Italian government bonds rose dramatically and there was a risk that the euro area might break apart. Or in 2015, when Greece was close to bankruptcy. Didn’t that demonstrate that the euro area doesn’t work well?[end_question] Have the countries in the south of the euro area done enough on their side to fix Monetary Union?[end_question] These achievements are now hanging in the balance because one country may no longer want to do its part. Even if their attempt to form a government has failed for now, Italy’s dominant parties are Eurosceptics who want to make massive tax cuts and spend lots of money, despite that fact that, at 132% of gross domestic product, Italy has one of the highest levels of sovereign debt in the world.[end_question] Risk premia for Italian government bonds have risen sharply again recently. At what point would the ECB intervene again, as it did in 2012?[end_question] So if Italy wants to circumvent the EU’s fiscal rules, it can’t necessarily count on the ECB’s help?[end_question] Aren’t we again seeing the conflict at the core of the euro area? On the one hand, you have the stability-oriented northern countries like Germany, and on the other, you have the south. You have followed this debate for so many years now. Can you explain why there is such a fundamental disparity between countries in terms of financial culture?[end_question] Would it have been easier to resolve the crisis if the German approach had not been so dominant?[end_question] French President Emmanuel Macron wants to eliminate those very shortcomings and thereby change the fundamental features of the euro area. His plans include a common European budget, a European finance minister and a common deposit insurance scheme for European banks. Can you understand that the German government is resisting many of these plans[end_question] Will it take another euro crisis before we have a banking union?[end_question] Right now, Germany is balking at the idea of this kind of mutualisation[end_question] There’s another point on which Germany stands more or less alone against most other euro area countries, and that’s interest rates. German savers are waiting to receive interest again on the money they have in the bank.[end_question] Savers’[end_question] That’s probably mainly to do with the steep rise in property prices.[end_question] Does that also apply to savers and investors[end_question] All the same, can you give German savers reason to hope that interest rates will finally start to rise again in 2019?[end_question] [end_question] As a result of[end_question] The looming trade war could also be[end_question] [end_question] Do you think that it will come to that?","No. There were times at the height of the crisis when there were existential doubts about how things would turn out. But I was never in any doubt that Monetary Union was the right thing for European countries.[end_answer] The problems were a consequence of the way the euro area was set up to start with, which was very minimalistic. At the time, it was felt that all we needed was a single currency, a central bank and a fiscal brake. But events have shown that that wasn’t enough. For example, a crisis mechanism was not envisaged and there was no banking supervision at the European level. A number of important decisions have been taken in the meantime, for instance on the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism. The euro area has started to fix itself – and we’re still in the middle of that process.[end_answer] Yes. The countries hardest hit by the crisis had high budget deficits and high current account deficits at the start of the crisis. So they were importing a lot more than they were exporting. But a great deal has been done since then. In the meantime, all the countries concerned have a primary fiscal surplus, which means that they are reducing their debt bit by bit. And all these countries now have a current account surplus; they are exporting more than they import. That is quite a turnaround.[end_answer] It is certainly a challenge, first and foremost for Italy itself. When financial markets attacked Italy in 2012, it demonstrated that perceptions in the financial markets can be volatile and the risk assessment of a given debtor can change abruptly, sometimes with severe consequences – and this even though Italy already had a primary surplus at the time. We will have to see what happens now.[end_answer] I would like to stress that every intervention has to contribute to the fulfilment of our mandate and is also subject to conditionality. The Outright Monetary Transactions programme for intervening in national sovereign bond markets of vulnerable countries can only be used if the country in question also agrees to an adjustment programme. The rules are very clear on this. Everyone should remember that.[end_answer] I will only say that Italy knows the rules. They should perhaps take another close look at them.[end_answer] There are certainly cultural differences that are rooted in history and are still in evidence. Some countries are against credit and high levels of debt, while others are less concerned. It is striking, for instance, that Germany has the lowest rate of property ownership in Europe. Why is that? In other countries people take out loans to build houses – especially now, with interest rates so low. In Germany, you barely see that happening. So, there are big cultural differences in certain respects, but reality has shown that compromises have to be made. And they have happened.[end_answer] Yes, I think so. Germany is a very successful country, and its success is built on a strong set of rules and respect for those rules. And things have gone very well for Germany since the Second World War. But this strict approach also has a weakness in times of crisis, particularly when a fast and flexible reaction is required. The reaction to the financial and sovereign debt crisis could have been quicker, and more flexible. That is my personal view. We have learned from the crisis and are in the process of fixing Monetary Union. But a few more steps still need to be taken. Most of all, we need much closer coordination of fiscal policy – and a stabilisation fund that can absorb sudden significant shocks. And the banking union is not yet complete.[end_answer] I think one of the reasons for hesitation on the part of many European governments is that the euro area is currently going through a phase of very robust economic growth. When times are good, it’s always difficult to undertake reforms, because there doesn’t seem to be any need. In the past, significant EU reforms were always decided on at the height of a crisis. But that also makes them more expensive.[end_answer] You’d think that the banking union would be the easiest of these reforms. What we need most of all here is to introduce a common European deposit insurance scheme, so that the savings of bank customers are protected at the European level if a bank fails. That would further strengthen confidence in the euro, because our money essentially consists of bank deposits.[end_answer] It’s already being solved. We have started to considerably reduce levels of what are known as non-performing loans in the euro area – by more than €300 billion since 2014. This reduction has come about as a result of the pressure exerted by ECB Banking Supervision. And that pressure will remain strong.[end_answer] I understand their concern. But German savers didn’t exactly have it better in the past. They might have got 2.25% interest on their deposits before the euro was introduced, but inflation was also much higher back then, at 2.4%. So what we call the real interest rate was negative then too.[end_answer] But then there is the other side of the coin. Low interest rates help public and private borrowers. People in Germany are not making use of that. As I said before, the rate of home ownership is pretty low – and has even declined in recent years.[end_answer] Yes, but only in cities, not everywhere. Germans could use the low lending rates to their own advantage. That would mean borrowing somewhat more, but many people just don’t want to do that. They could have taken much greater advantage of the situation.[end_answer] Yes, people in Germany leave too much money in their account instead of investing it in other, higher-yielding assets.[end_answer] There will not necessarily be a crash. But history shows that stock markets cannot go up forever. The economy will go into a recession again at some point, and then there will also be a correction in the stock markets. Nobody knows how big that correction will be. But no one is expecting a major crisis – unless there is a huge geopolitical crisis. That would be a different situation.[end_answer] I don’t think that anyone wants a real trade war, because everyone knows that we would all stand to lose.",['inflation was also much higher'],"['25% interest on their deposits before the euro was introduced, but inflation was also much higher back then, at 2']",1943,M,Portugal,2010 - 2018,['interest on their deposit before the euro be introduce but inflation be also much high back then at '],['interest on their deposit before the euro be introduce but inflation be also much high back then at '],1,1,6214,[],0,['They might have got 2.25 interest on their deposits before the euro was introduced but inflation was also much higher back then at 2.4.

264,2018-05-18,Interview with Bloomberg TV,Vítor Constâncio,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2018/html/ecb.in180518.en.html,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon on 17 May 2018","I'm here with Vítor Constâncio, a man who has been at the heart of ECB policymaking basically since the birth of the euro almost two decades ago. For the last eight years he's been Vice-President. His term expires this month, but over that period, dating back to the all-too-brief period of calm between two recessions, he's been through the unfortunate rate hikes of 2011, quantitative easing, negative interest rates and the rescue of the euro area from deflation – or the threat of deflation at the very least. Today, when the Governing Council is almost, but not quite, ready to talk about exiting stimulus, Vice-President Vítor Constâncio is with me today. It's been quite an eight years, and here we are: you're about to go at a critical moment, because the economy is slowing. How worried are you?[end_question] The Deputy Governor of the Finnish central bank, Olli Rehn, who is tipped to, is likely to join the ECB, has been nominated to do so, he says the medium-term outlook is tilted towards the downside. That's not quite the same as the ECB says.[end_question] Are you still comfortable with market expectations, which are roughly for an end to QE – to net asset purchases – this year, then a rate hike the middle of 2019. Does that sound reasonable?[end_question] One of the risks the ECB has always been citing is unwarranted market tightening. There's a couple of risks out there; one at the moment is Italy, of course. We've seen bond spreads expand. Some of the wilder ideas, such as asking the ECB to write off €250 billion of debt, have been dropped. There is still this issue about how you measure debt-to-GDP ratios. But the problem is, bond yields, bond prices have been falling, the spreads have been widening. Does that worry you?[end_question] You're also watching the euro […] as another issue? The euro's softened quite a bit in recent weeks. In fact, you do get the sense from comments from policymakers that there's not a great deal of concern at the moment about the strength of the euro – which wasn't true a few months ago – or the direction, I should say, of the euro. Is that true?[end_question] So you're reasonably comfortable with where the euro is at the moment?[end_question] Another risk out there is Iran. This is a slightly tricky one, of course, because Europe now has to deal with the prospect of sanctions on companies that deal with Iran via payments. If it’s involving payments, it's going to involve the ECB one way or another. Presumably the ECB takes a view on this situation?[end_question] There is a big summit next month, of course, of leaders. It's an important one because there's a new European Parliament next year. What's not agreed at this summit next month might not be agreed for quite some time to come, depending on how Parliament changes. You put out some pretty bold proposals for the way the Monetary Union needs to move in a speech today. How confident are you that any of this is really going to happen?[end_question] Yes, somebody else's job, because you're going to move on. Now, eight years in – and just briefly, if you can – if you had to change one thing, if you'd done one thing differently, or the ECB had done one thing differently, in those eight years, what would it be?[end_question] Vice-President Constâncio, good luck for whatever comes next. Thank you very much indeed for your time today.","Just a slight slowdown so far – which, by the way, was expected. You may recall that the staff projections that were published, after the high growth of last year, already pointed to a certain deceleration. So, what is happening is still within the bounds of the staff projections for the whole year, which nevertheless forecast growth above 2%.[end_answer] I have not read what he said, but let me remind you: the projections that have been published, they foresee a growth rate for next year around 2% and then 1.7% for 2020. Indeed, on a path of deceleration, because for demographic reasons and other reasons, potential growth is not very high in Europe – by the way, not also in other advanced economies. We have been growing above potential, especially last year, this year also. Of course, as the output gap closes, we are reverting to potential growth.[end_answer] I won’t comment on that. It's difficult of course to anticipate what may happen. All central banks are to a degree data-dependent, so we monitor of course what is happening. But what I can tell you is that we generally consider that markets have been reading our reaction function quite well. It's also, I presume – or at least, being biased, I will say it – that it's also because of the way we have communicated. Indeed, that understanding of our reaction function has improved over the years and has been quite good recently.[end_answer] We have to monitor that situation, of course. It's a change from what has been happening recently. The problems of Italy are the same, as known by everyone, particularly in the market, of course. The yields and the spreads had been contained until recently. There is this spike. We have to see how it will develop. It depends, of course – as always – very much on the policies that will be actually implemented in Italy, as in other member countries.[end_answer] We were concerned always with excessive volatility in exchange rates, but we don't have a target for the exchange rate, as you know. The volatility in foreign exchange markets, particularly among the advanced economies, has been attributable more to what has happened to the dollar than events linked with other parts of the world. So, that is still the story, and what has happened is that, indeed, we have seen different movements now in the dollar, appreciating also for reasons. Because it's always, markets are very good at doing that, or market analysts, at rationalising what markets are doing. There are, of course, very good narratives explaining why the dollar has been going down and up and now is going up.[end_answer] Yes.[end_answer] As you know, there have been sanctions already before. They were lifted after the agreement, and we've gone through that period without major consequences, particularly for the central banks. I am not really expecting that whatever happens in that sphere will have a very meaningful impact on what we will do.[end_answer] That was not the perspective of my speech. As I explained, I talked as a technocratic adviser, saying what technically would be necessary to really move towards a very solid Monetary Union, working smoothly, and reducing doubts about the solidity of the whole project. I put forward some technical proposals, but I didn't discuss on purpose the political economy feasibility of what I was saying from a technocratic perspective. It's for governments to make their choices, of course. I do think that the vested interest of all countries is to move forward, deepening the Monetary Union, but it's in the hands of the governments.[end_answer] Nothing really very meaningful in the end. I made a speech at the beginning of the month where I talked about the past and future of ECB monetary policy. I went through some episodes that were controversial in some of our decisions in the past. With hindsight, I admit that indeed the decisions were not always perfect and I explained why. I also explained that in both the cases I highlighted in that speech, we very quickly corrected those decisions by changing interest rates in the opposite direction. So, the overall effect of these incidents was in the end not very significant.",[],[],1943,M,Portugal,2010 - 2018,[],[],0,0,4172,[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
266,2018-04-26,Risk reduction in the euro area – how low can you go?,Sabine Lautenschläger,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2018/html/ecb.in180426_1.en.html,"Contribution by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Eurofi Newsletter, 26 April 2018",,"The financial crisis demonstrated that risks need to be kept in check, both at bank level and at systemic level. To that end, the euro area has taken many steps over recent years. It has grown closer together and this has helped to reduce risks.[end_answer] The European banking union is the centrepiece of these efforts. The first pillar, European banking supervision, was set up in 2014 to ensure that banks across the euro area are supervised to the same high standards. To that end, we have harmonised the supervisory approach applied to the 118 largest banking groups. In the process, we made use of the discretion contained in both the European and the national frameworks. This enabled us, for example, to move in 2014 from 19 different Supervisory Review and Evaluation Processes to a single harmonised one. This and many other changes in day-to-day supervision help to reduce risks and ensure that banks remain both safe and sound.[end_answer] The second pillar of the banking union was established in 2016: the Single Resolution Mechanism. This ensures that banks can fail in an orderly manner. The failure of a bank must not pose a threat to financial stability or to public funds. Recent bank failures have shown that the new system works; supervisory and resolution authorities have cooperated smoothly and effectively.[end_answer] This new institutional set-up is a good basis for reducing risks, but it needs further refinement. Regulation, for instance, needs to be further harmonised. To reap the full benefits of the banking union, we need a harmonised regulatory framework.[end_answer] First, there is the issue of options and national discretions (ONDs). While some of these ONDs have been harmonised by supervisors, others lie in the hands of national legislators. Waivers for large exposure limits, for instance, are still fragmented across the euro area. This in turn affects other cross-border waivers, such as that on liquidity requirements. More generally, it stands in the way of a truly European banking market, as do the other ONDs that fall within the competence of national legislators.[end_answer] Second, recent bank failures have shown that we need to further harmonise the tools for crisis management. We need to remove the overlap between standard supervisory measures and early intervention measures, for instance. As we are obliged to apply the least intrusive tool, the overlap often prevents us from taking early intervention measures. We also need to expand our toolbox to include a harmonised moratorium tool. Finally, national insolvency laws need to be aligned. All this would make the Single Resolution Mechanism even more effective.[end_answer] These measures will help to better contain risks in the future. However, we also have to reduce the risks we face today. Non-performing loans (NPLs) currently pose one of the biggest risks to the European banking sector. They need to be dealt with first and foremost by the banks themselves. Some progress has been made on this front, although more needs to be done. In addition, supervisors need to play their part. European supervisors closely monitor how banks approach NPLs, and in 2017 and 2018 the ECB published guidance on the subject. The aim is not only to resolve the current NPL problem, but also to keep it from recurring in the future. Finally, legislators also need to address the issue of NPLs. Across the euro area, legal and judicial systems differ substantially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency when it comes to dealing with NPLs. The time and resources required to resolve NPLs thus differ from country to country. National legislators should strive to improve legal and judicial frameworks. In the end, tackling NPLs requires a joint effort by banks, supervisors and legislators.[end_answer] To sum up, there are still things we can do to reduce risks in the euro area. In doing so, we will grow closer together, and that in turn will help to reduce risks further; European banking supervision is a prime example of this. We must thus be careful not to reach a point where we neither reduce risks nor grow closer together. We have to keep moving on both fronts; only then will we reach our destination of a more stable and prosperous European Union.",[],[],1964,F,Germany,2014 - 2019,[],[],0,0,4268,[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
268,2018-04-10,Interview with France Info,Benoît Cœuré,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2018/html/ecb.in180410.en.html,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean Leymarie on 9 April 2018 and published on 10 April 2018","We are still seeing growth in Europe, there is certainly growth, but it seems increasingly clear that it is slowing down. Does that worry you?[end_question] Could it result in a change in your monetary policy?[end_question] Just to remind our listeners: there is, in particular, the huge asset purchase programme you launched three years ago, which has involved buying public and private sector securities for the vast sum of €2,500 billion. When are you going to end this programme?[end_question] Will it have come to a stop by the end of the year?[end_question] In the event of an economic slowdown – and, again, it is a possibility – do you have the means to respond effectively?[end_question] Inflation is currently at 1.4%...[end_question] Is that a good level?[end_question] The major issue at present are the threats issued by the US President, Donald Trump, who blows hot and cold on trade policy, and in particular this power struggle he has embarked on with China. Should Europe get involved at this stage?[end_question] For now, Trump is saying “I’ll threaten Europe but without specific customs barriers on European products”…[end_question] Is what we are experiencing a trade war?[end_question] Have you put a figure on it at the ECB, have you drawn up a scenario?[end_question] How large a drop?[end_question] Would that be a serious situation?[end_question] But that’s exactly what Donald Trump doesn’t want – he rejects such multilateral frameworks…[end_question] Would you urge Europeans to “make themselves heard”? What is your message to them?[end_question] I’d also like us to talk about another subject entirely – the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It’s an important issue that was the subject of much discussion a few weeks ago. Bitcoin rocketed in value several months ago before falling back; at one point one bitcoin was worth almost USD 20,000, but today it’s around USD 7,000. Is this the end of bitcoin?[end_question] But for bitcoin defenders it’s not just about the technology. It’s almost a philosophy for them – they see it as a free currency that can throw off the shackles of states and central banks. Do you understand that?","I don’t think we are seeing a slowdown in growth. This is something that we monitor very closely, we follow all the indicators. We are seeing indicators that had risen to very, very high levels, levels that had not been seen for many years, in some cases 10 or 15 years. And these indicators are now undergoing a slight correction that was fairly inevitable, as there comes a point when growth stops accelerating and stabilises on a certain trajectory. Moreover, this was already incorporated in our forecasts. So we will not be revising our forecasts at present as a result of this correction. I can’t speak for the future – we will continue to monitor these developments – but, for now, it’s a stabilisation, and it’s not something that particularly concerns us.[end_answer] No, for the reasons I have just given. Again, I’m not going to speak for the future, since everything is completely dependent on the data we receive on an ongoing basis. But monetary policy follows a long-term trajectory, one that requires patience. We know that monetary policy will need to remain very accommodative for quite some time.[end_answer] That is a discussion that we will certainly be having soon, since the programme is currently proceeding at a monthly pace of €30 billion until at least September. We haven’t said any more than that. So, we’ll need to have a discussion fairly soon about what comes next…[end_answer] I don’t know yet, because the Governing Council of the ECB has not yet discussed it, let alone reached a decision. But the discussion is not just about asset purchases, it’s also about the right combination of instruments that allows us to support economic activity and bring inflation back towards 2%. There are not just the asset purchases, there are also interest rates. And on this, we have been clear that interest rates will remain at their current levels, that is, very, very low, close to zero – even below zero – for a long period, even beyond the horizon of our asset purchases. So we need to look at the longer term.[end_answer] It’s not a possibility that we are currently talking about, because right now there is no reason to worry about growth in the euro area. Growth is very strong, very robust and very broad-based across the euro area. But whatever the circumstances, the ECB has a clear mandate: to bring inflation back towards 2%. We will do whatever needs to be done to bring inflation back towards 2%. But at the moment there is no need to adjust the path that has been decided on by the Governing Council.[end_answer] Yes, it’s just under 1.5%.[end_answer] It’s not enough, it’s disappointing. But we know the reasons: it’s because unemployment is still high and there is a lot of economic slack in Europe. But we want to bring inflation back towards 2% in the medium term, and that is why monetary policy will remain accommodative.[end_answer] As a large trading power, Europe is bound to be affected…[end_answer] Europe has a single trade policy and that means it has to react, and not just to the threat of import tariffs. It also needs to look at the source of the problem, that is, overcapacity throughout the world, and in particular overcapacity in China. This is not a matter for the ECB, of course; it’s a matter for the European Commission and for EU governments. What’s important for us, from an economic perspective, is that we avoid an escalation and avoid belligerent language. If there were to be a trade war, it could be very damaging for the global economy…[end_answer] Not yet. There are threats, skirmishes, you might say, but it is not yet a trade war. If we were to plunge into a trade war, that could have a very damaging effect, also on the US economy…[end_answer] Yes, we have drawn up a scenario – which is worth as much as scenarios and models are worth – but it’s a scenario that does not reflect the current situation and the current declarations of the US President. Rather, it’s a scenario in which all countries increase their import tariffs by 10%: a true trade war scenario that is very severe. In this scenario, we see a significant drop in global activity that also affects the United States, and that is precisely what we now need to avoid.[end_answer] 2.5% of GDP in the United States, and 1% of GDP on a global level.[end_answer] It would be a very serious situation and it must be avoided. Governments are responsible for avoiding it, and above all for resolving these differences on a multilateral basis.[end_answer] It’s not what Mr Trump wants, true, but it’s what Europe wants. Europe wants the world to be managed in an inclusive way where everybody gathers round the table for discussions.[end_answer] They are speaking up. They don’t need the ECB to lecture them, a trade policy already exists. Discussions between countries are under way in Brussels and the European Commission has already started working on it.[end_answer] It’s undoubtedly the end of an illusion – that bitcoin could become a global currency that would eventually replace the dollar or the euro. We can clearly see that bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, cannot be considered reliable assets, or as economists like to say, a “store of value”, when their value fluctuates so much. This isn’t how you go about investing your savings for your retirement. But we shouldn’t disregard the possibilities opened up by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, particularly on the technological front. It’s something that all central banks are looking at. For example, we’re investigating whether “blockchain” technology, which underpins bitcoin, could one day support our payment systems. This sort of thinking is useful, important and positive.[end_answer] Yes, and I think we must take heed of that. Investors should be warned about the specific dangers of investing in bitcoin, and everybody has done so. But we also have to understand what this tells us – technologies exist that can transform the world of payments and currencies, and these technologies should be incorporated. It’s also telling us that there is a certain amount of defiance towards the traditional financial system, and potentially that everything we have done since the financial crisis to reform the banks, clean up the financial system and reduce risks may not have been enough, or may not have been understood. And that’s something we have to take on board.","['bring inflation back', 'bring inflation back', 'bring inflation back', 'bring inflation back']","['But the discussion is not just about asset purchases, it’s also about the right combination of instruments that allows us to support economic activity and bring inflation back towards 2%', 'But whatever the circumstances, the ECB has a clear mandate: to bring inflation back towards 2%', 'We will do whatever needs to be done to bring inflation back towards 2%', 'But we want to bring inflation back towards 2% in the medium term, and that is why monetary policy will remain accommodative']",1969,M,France,2012 -

How was the past year when you were working side by side?[end_question] Despite this, his critics point to the fact that he has left behind a European economy that is “drugged”, with low growth, rates at zero and inflation very far from the objective.[end_question] Sometimes it seemed like you were not exactly among Mr Draghi’s most ardent supporters.[end_question] But when you heard him being talked about asthesaviour of the euro or the person who had rescued Spain, it didn’t sit well with you.[end_question] As Vice-President will you continue to appear alongside President Lagarde?[end_question] Brexit, trade and currency wars, geopolitical tensions. All of this in an environment of lower growth, zero rates and stimulus plans. When you were in government you joked that you slept like a baby, in that you woke up crying every two hours. How are you sleeping now?[end_question] So do you echo the calls of Presidents Draghi and Lagarde for countries with fiscal space, above all Germany, to boost spending and investment?[end_question] But it’s something you were already asking for when you were a minister, and it’s not happening now, and even in the best of cases it won’t happen for another four or five years. And without that level of firepower…[end_question] What are your thoughts on the Spanish economy?[end_question] Spain didn’t have any issues during the growth phase of the cycle. But now we are maybe seeing the effects of not having made any reforms in recent years, deferred budgets, or adjusted deficits during growth periods.[end_question] Are you worried by the political uncertainty?[end_question] What do they think here in Frankfurt about the fact that the budget has been deferred since the time when you were still a minister?[end_question] The public message is quite clear. Are there more discreet messages in private?[end_question] Have the ECB’s non-standard measures run their course?[end_question] And each measure has less of a return.[end_question] Are you in favour of changing or widening the ECB’s mandate? Or of defining more precisely what is below, but close to, 2%?[end_question] What about “helicopter money”, i.e. giving money directly to citizens?[end_question] But should it be considered, just like changing the mandate?[end_question] There is a lot of talk currently about “Japanification”, about secular stagnation. Add to this demographics and the fact that there is a smaller working population with lower productivity than before. What scares you the most?[end_question] Will EDIS be complete when you leave office?[end_question] One of the German proposals is to limit the amount of sovereign debt held by financial entities. Spain has experienced precisely that, with only national entities continuing to buy public debt at the same rate. Does that seem reasonable to you?[end_question] Does the issue with Popular, Villarejo and BBVA bother you?","Frankfurt is a nice city, I like it. The ECB is the most important institution in the framework of the EU, and of the euro area in particular. Exposure to the public is very different to when you’re in government. Here, the relationship is mainly with the European Parliament, through hearings, and with the public, through speeches. Is my life better? It’s different.[end_answer] I can keep speaking normally. I still attend the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN); each week, we have discussions in various forums on issues around monetary and economic policy and financial stability. So I have something to offer, but my contributions aren’t political.[end_answer] I don’t miss anything. That was my job for six years. I’m not at all bored here.[end_answer] I wanted to leave the government at the end of its first term. I spoke to President Rajoy and we said it could be a possibility, and it was very attractive to me. It’s the most important institution in the euro area, very prestigious. It takes very significant decisions, which made it an extremely attractive proposition.[end_answer] I don’t think anything was predetermined or premeditated. Members of the Governing Council have different profiles and each of them contributes according to their experience. I contribute my knowledge of the European economy and the financial system, and my experience taking decisions when the Spanish economy was at its most delicate moment.[end_answer] The 25 members of the Governing Council don’t always agree, although many of the decisions we take are unanimous. There are those who think that the situation requires further measures, and others who think we have already gone too far. We look for a consensus. The decisions are very democratic – one Governor, one vote – but actually taking a vote is an exception, not the rule.[end_answer] I’m not at all concerned by the fact that there are differing views, that’s healthy and it’s normal because there are 25 of us. But what has been happening in recent months has not been very helpful. It hasn’t undermined the effectiveness of the September package of measures, because it went ahead as planned, but it’s much better to be united. We are a collegial institution and once we have reached an agreement, everyone should defend it. This is not to say, for example, that I agreed with every element of the package. But once something has been approved, I defend it.[end_answer] No. This is actually one of the top priorities of the new President. Each of us will have our own ideas about the situation and the appropriate measures to take, that’s one thing, but it’s something else entirely to air disagreements in public.[end_answer] Mario Draghi will go down in history as one of the founding fathers of the euro, even though he isn’t one in the strictest sense. There were two stages to his presidency. The first was saving the euro, with his famous “whatever it takes”. The second was fighting deflation. These were his two main interventions, and he was successful in both. He will be remembered very positively. When he uttered those famous words in London in 2012, he changed the outlook in the euro area. The banking union was implemented right away. Four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched, which brought the ECB in line with other central banks. Mario Draghi has modernised the instruments of monetary policy.[end_answer] Monetary policy is not the reason for this; it’s been the main driver of the economic recovery and growth in Europe. 11 million jobs have been created, in no small part thanks to monetary policy. This is the main thing, although there are collateral effects. The problem we have at the moment is that these monetary policy decisions need to be complemented by other instruments.[end_answer] I have always supported President Draghi.[end_answer] Well, he didn’t see it like that either. In Spain, we rescued ourselves, off our own backs, with the help of our European partners, including the ECB. Mr Draghi made a key contribution, but there’s no single saviour here. It was a set of circumstances and a matter of everyone carrying out their responsibilities in their individual roles.[end_answer] I have no idea. I suppose it will continue like that. It’s an unwritten rule, a tradition. Traditions can change, but they can also be of value.[end_answer] Well. Very well! I wouldn’t wish what happened in 2012 on my worst enemy. The situation now is totally different; back then we were on the brink of collapse. The Spanish economy, the Italian economy, doubts about the integrity of the euro… the situation of the Spanish banking industry was terrifying and contagion was spreading to the Treasury. It was a dramatic situation. I don’t think there is going to be a recession in Europe, that’s very unlikely. But yes, I am worried that we will have two or three years of subdued growth, of below-potential growth. That is what is worrying me at the moment. And that this subdued growth may mean that the price stability objective is not met. Monetary policy is not the philosopher’s stone, it cannot be used to fix everything. Other policies are needed.[end_answer] This is important, yes, but my proposal goes further than that. Our current system of national fiscal policies and national budgets, with a set of rules like the Stability and Growth Pact, is not sufficient. We need a fiscal instrument of the sort proposed by President Macron a few years ago. An instrument that has the capacity to act countercyclically and that complements monetary policy.[end_answer] We have to call for it because it is sensible. It is not a question of whether it is possible, but rather one of reality. It would be very important for the entire euro area and I am convinced that it will come about sooner rather than later.[end_answer] The Spanish economy is doing well. It is competitive and enjoying above-average growth, and that is the result of the reforms in 2012 and 2013 and society’s efforts. It is doing well, that’s the truth. It has been affected by the economic slowdown, like the rest of the euro area, but growth is still at 2%. Why? The financial sector was cleaned up, and the economy is now competitive. Those are the two reasons why it is doing better.[end_answer] My recommendation is for the euro area as a whole, not just for Spain. If you have debt approaching 100% of GDP, you have to reduce it to be less vulnerable.[end_answer] Political uncertainty is an important factor because we always need stable governments capable of taking action. And this is of course quite obvious: we don’t have the political stability necessary to put into place the necessary measures and policies, including a budget.[end_answer] Spain has continued to reduce its public debt. It could have been reduced more, but it could also have been reduced less. In any case there is one fundamental factor: the growth differential. In the Spanish economy, this now comes from a financial sector that doesn’t have the same doubts hanging over it as it did five to seven years ago. And it is competitive. The most important thing, in contrast to the previous and other growth cycles, is that it is growing without an increase in loans and without a real estate bubble. With lending growth that is below nominal GDP and a current account surplus in the balance of payments. As long as these two things continue, the Spanish economy will keep growing faster than the rest. The recommendation, which is also valid for Portugal, Greece and Ireland, and even for Italy, is this: stabilise the banking sector and the credit markets. And maintain competitiveness. Then you will do better than average.[end_answer] No, none. I say the same thing in public that I do in private.[end_answer] No. We can still increase bond purchases or lower interest rates further, which means that we still have the same tools available. What is happening is that the secondary effects are becoming more tangible .[end_answer] I look at the effects, and these can vary greatly. I am worried by risk taking in the asset management sector against the background of low interest rates. It is a matter of concern for me. Banks are now better capitalised, they have more liquidity, and they are much safer than they were. But they face low profitability, which is a problem. Supervision is centralised and is more suitable than when it was the remit of national authorities. But in the area of asset management and investment funds, what we see is that, in a low interest rate environment, their investment strategy always moves towards increased risk, in the sense of assets with potentially greater returns and greater risks but that are less liquid. And there is also more leveraging, not to the extent seen in the United States, but still more than before. And the supervision in this sector is not comparable with that in the banking sector. There is a risk. If they are asked for units to be paid out they have to do so within two or three days. I see a potential risk of liquidity imbalance. That is what worries me the most at the moment. And, while it may not technically be a secondary effect of monetary policy, because its causes are structural, I am concerned by the banking sector’s low profitability.[end_answer] We have to look at that, yes. The ECB set out its strategy in 1998 and revised it in 2003 and, while it can’t be a change of mandate, since that is defined in the Treaty, we could revisit the definition of price stability. And what are the steps to achieve that? I am in favour of starting the discussion, but we haven’t had it. The President has announced it, but this is not a matter of one or two Governing Council meetings; it is something that must be done without haste, but decisively.[end_answer] No, that has never been considered.[end_answer] No, absolutely not.[end_answer] From a journalistic standpoint talking about Japanification is attractive, but there are actually many differences. While European demographics are not brilliant, they cannot be compared with Japan. The situation facing banks here is not as bad. No real estate bubble has burst here the way it did there. The parallels are in low inflation, low interest rates and low growth. But the outlooks are different and I don’t think that the term really applies to the European economy.[end_answer] Yes, I think it will, and quite a few years before that, in fact.[end_answer] It’s a starting point. Completing EDIS is crucial. But we also have to take measures simultaneously to limit how much risk is generated by certain countries. In my experience with Banco Popular and the savings banks, the problem wasn’t public debt. The underlying problem was other types of loans that led to solvency problems.[end_answer] We do not comment on specific situations. Of course, European banking supervision and risk surveillance is on the lookout for anything that might have an effect on financial stability, but so far we have not seen anything.","['fighting deflation', 'facing the risk of deflation', 'low inflation']","['The second was fighting deflation.', 'Four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched, which brought the ECB in line with other central banks.', 'The parallels are in low inflation, low interest rates and low growth.']",1960,M,Spain,2018 -,"['the second be fight deflation ', 'four or five year ago we be face the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme be launch which bring the ECB in line with other central bank ', 'the parallel be in low inflation low interest rate and low growth ']","['the second be fight deflation ', 'four or five year ago we be face the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme be launch which bring the ECB in line with other central bank ', 'the parallel be in low inflation low interest rate and low growth ']",3,3,11066,"[('deflation', 'fight'), ('low', 'inflation')]",2,"['The second was fighting deflation.', 'Four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ECB in line with other central banks.', 'The parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth.']",3,3,"['the second was fighting deflation', 'four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ecb in line with other central banks', 'the parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth']","['warfare', 'warfare', 'other']","[True, True, True]","[('deflation', 'fight'), ('low', 'inflation')]","['the second was fighting deflation.', 'the parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth.']",2,"['warfare', 'warfare', 'orientation']",3,3,"['the second was fighting deflation', 'four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ecb in line with other central banks', 'the parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth']","['warfare', 'warfare', 'other']","['the second was fighting deflation', 'four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ecb in line with other central banks', 'the parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth']","['warfare', 'warfare', 'other']","['the second was fighting deflation', 'four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ecb in line with other central banks', 'the parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth']","['warfare', 'warfare', 'other']","['warfare', 'warfare', 'other']","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]","[True, True, True]","[True, True, False]"
282,2019-11-23,Interview with Sky TG24,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2019/html/ecb.in191123~860f3290d2.en.html,"Transcript of the interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Alessandro Marenzi, Sky TG24, with the participation of Federico Fubini, Corriere della Sera, and Franco Bruni, Bocconi University, broadcast on 23 November 2019","Alessandro Marenzi: Sette anni fa Draghi disse: faremo tutto quello che serve per preservare l’euro. [..] Dopo sette anni c’è ancora questo problema di preservare l’euro o non si pone nemmeno più la questione?[end_question] Alessandro Marenzi: I tassi bassi o negativi si stanno sperimentando nel concreto. [..] Quanto durerà questa situazione e quali rischi ci sono in una situazione così paradossale per certi aspetti?[end_question] [end_question] Federico Fubini: [..] Pensa che ci sia un punto oltre il quale la politica dei tassi negativi finisca per ledere la percezione che una parte del pubblico europeo ha della Bce?[end_question] Franco Bruni: [..] Molti di noi pensano che sia il momento di ripensare con calma alla strategia della banca centrale nel perseguire il suo obiettivo statutario e fare una riflessione che metta insieme l’esperienza di questi anni e guardi al futuro tenendo conto anche di queste obiezioni sui tassi negativi, sull’eccesso di liquidità. Mi domando se c’è in programma di cominciare a pensare a una riflessione strategica.[end_question] Alessandro Marenzi: [..] Molti sostengono che l’arsenale della Bce è vuoto, che non ci sono più molte altre munizionisoluzioni. È vero oppure sono troppo critici coloro che dicono che siamo sostanzialmente indifesi se arriva una nuova crisi?[end_question] Alessandro Marenzi: Lei viene da un paese che anni fa ha avuto bisogno, l’Irlanda, qualche anno fa ha avuto bisogno di un salvataggio. [..] Si parla oggi molto del fondo salva stati, il Meccanismo europeo di stabilità, s che va riformato e c’è oggi un dibattito molto forte. Lo stesso Governatore della Banca centrale italiana ha detto: attenzione, perché se si fa questa riforma nel modo sbagliato ci sono rischi. Lei condivide queste le riserve o questii dubbi, espressi anche dal Governatore Visco, sul nuovo ruolo che avrà il Mes nella riforma di cui si discute?[end_question] Federico Fubini: Mi verrebbe da chiedere a Philip Lane se ritiene che il principio di un coinvolgimento del settore privato nelle perdite che si è affermato con la direttiva BRRD nelle banche, sia un principio condivisibile e da tenere a mente e anche da mettere in pratica all’occorrenza in anche nel caso di crisi di paesi che dovessero rivolgersi al Mes per chiedere un aiutoel debito sovrano? [..] Lei ritiene che il Mesl’ESM debba fare un’analisi stringente della sostenibilità del debito con l’idea di imporre delle perdite anche degli obbligazionisti prima di mettere a disposizione il denaro degli altri paesi per sostenere un governo in crisi?[end_question] Franco Bruni: Molti pensano che i paesi che hanno tendenza a fare troppio debitio non smpetteranno mai di farlo se i tassi di interesse sono sempre molto bassi, se la banca centrale continua a comprare i titoli e se anche le banche commerciali continuano a comprare titoli del proprio governo. [..] Se si tengono si compra tutto, se si tengono i tassi troppo bassi l’indisciplina prevale. Non pensa?[end_question] Alessandro Marenzi: [..] Il concetto di helicopter money, è una favola oppure è un meccanismo che si può studiare concretamente?","Philip Lane: What we have seen in the last seven years is a very long track record of a very stable currency. Remember what we have seen in these years: we've seen the interest rates in Europe very low, the spreads between governments much more narrow, and the inflation is controlled. So, yes, a very stable currency, and in the surveys the European population is increasingly happy with the euro as a currency.[end_answer] Philip Lane: I think it's important to emphasise that we recognise the dangers. For example, you give the example of negative rates on deposits, and this is why at the ECB in recent years, we take a multidimensional approach. We do have the negative rates, but we also have the asset purchase programme. We have targeted lending and we have forward guidance on interest rates, so we are trying to make sure that not all of the monetary policy operates through the negative rate. But we cannot rule it out. Of course, everyone agrees: at some level the negative rate will not be helpful. But our assessment is: we are not at that level now. If it is necessary to put the rate lower, we will be prepared to do so. It's a very important message and this goes back to the wider discussion.In any country, those who are a saver - every saver - would like to see a higher interest rate. But the answer to that is: let's get the European economy to invest more, because without more investment those savings have nowhere to go. The key to more investment is really good policies across the European Union: pro-innovation, pro-enterprise, pro-education. The key to a high return on investment is much more about those policies. It's a mistake to exaggerate the role of the ECB.[end_answer] Philip Lane: I think it's important to recognise that already the ECB has changed quite a bit, essentially from 2014 onwards. The ECB I think surprised many commentators by being so aggressive to tackle low inflation. The ECB has launched the sovereign bond programme. It has launched targeted lending, many innovations. Even this year, in the summertime we clarified that the inflation rate of 1.6 is too low, so the discussion now is much more precise. We do not find it acceptable to have inflation around 1.6. So 1.6 is not close to 2. That is important. We also emphasised in recent months that we view the inflation aim as symmetric. So we care just as much about inflation too low as inflation too high. Remember 20 years ago, the challenge was to convince everyone that we would keep inflation low. Now the challenge is to convince everyone that we will make sure inflation goes back to where we'd like it.I agree with you; many people agree that essentially the last major review was 2003. It is time to take stock, look at this experience and also recognise what element is unique to the ECB, and what is a global issue. As you know, the Fed in the US is in a review right now and many of the challenges are the same.[end_answer] Philip Lane: I think that is overly dramatic. I think everyone watching should be assured that, of course, as the ECB - as the controller of the euro currency - we have many ways to provide monetary accommodation. We all the time are examining our options, our instruments. But please remember: our ability to control the money supply is a very powerful weapon. Although, of course, we are in negative territory with negative rates, with all the programmes, the idea that monetary policy is at some limit: we don't see it. Our assessment, the work of our staff, believes that we have more room if we need it. Please remember, our forecast is that actually we will see an improvement in the next year or two. The scenarios where we need to have more dramatic policies, yes, if there is a severe negative shock, a big recession. But under the baseline, under the most likely scenario, we think the current policies are in good shape.[end_answer] Philip Lane: Let me emphasise that the understanding of the reform of the ESM and the very important issues about how sovereign debt will be treated, these are commonly understood. The concerns expressed by Governor Visco, everyone in the ECB, I think everyone across Europe understands this. My assessment is: the proposed reform of the ESM should not be viewed as too dramatic. Remember, right now no government in Europe faces a funding problem. The interest rates on all of the governments are quite low. There is no sign of any government having to go to the ESM and the whole point these days of the ESM is to reassure investors that if there were a problem, that we do have a European institution that will step in. I think that it's a very important debate, but I think everyone should feel comfortable with the proposed reform.[end_answer] Philip Lane: I think the risk associated with this approach is well understood. But please remember: what is the alternative? To argue that under zero circumstances there can be a sovereign debt restructuring is not plausible. Please remember also: the foundation of the European Union, of the European Monetary Union, is that in extreme circumstances there cannot be a 100 percent guarantee on any sovereign. At the same time, please remember that this reform is in no way suggesting any level of automatic restructuring. Please remember that the ESM has representation from all member countries. I think in terms of logic, to rule out 100 percent, under all circumstances, debt sustainability analysis is just not plausible. [If that is necessary], it has to be the case that sovereign debt hasn't had that [high a] level of market discipline. But equally, I think everyone understands that this is really a very extreme situation.There can be many situations, I think, like we had in the Irish case, where the ESM money was available without any debt restructuring. We know there's a large grey zone, a zone where, if the ESM funding is available, the sovereign debt is fully sustainable. Really the question of restructuring is only - in respect actually – an extreme scenario.[end_answer] Philip Lane: Let me emphasise that what we see is that the credit spread remains and, as you say, if there is more risk of fiscal problems, the spread goes up. If there is a reassurance that a government will conform with European expectations, the spread comes down. Our assessment is: even though, of course, the Eurosystem is the big purchaser of sovereign debt, the market still understands that it is not a guarantee. Of course, today because of the inflation too low, we have this policy, but it's a policy about inflation. It's not a policy about the public finances. And so in the future, because we do expect inflation to recover and we do not expect that the super-low rate that we see today is necessarily forever, I think any government which is benefiting from the low interest rate today, as part of their fiscal strategy should be using this opportunity, in part to break the debt down in a gradual way. Let me reassure you that the ECB's policy is about inflation. It is not about providing an excuse to governments not to make sure their public finances are in good shape.[end_answer] Philip Lane: I think it's a fascinating story to examine and I think it's interesting to discuss. But let me emphasise that it is not on the horizon -even to some people with some of those attractions that we don't think will be true to reality. So it remains the case that I think there are more headaches than solutions with that idea.","['inflation is controlled', 'tackle low inflation', 'inflation rate of 1.6 is too low', 'inflation aim', 'inflation too low', 'inflation too high', 'keep inflation low', 'inflation goes back to', 'inflation too low', 'inflation to recover']","['Remember what we have seen in these years: we`ve seen the interest rates in Europe very low, the spreads between governments much more narrow, and the inflation is controlled.', 'The ECB I think surprised many commentators by being so aggressive to tackle low inflation', 'Even this year, in the summertime we clarified that the inflation rate of 1.6 is too low, so the discussion now is much more precise.', 'That is important.

290,2019-09-30,Interview with Financial Times,Mario Draghi,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2019/html/ecb.in190930~d0a72d3141.en.html,"Interview with Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, conducted by Lionel Barber and Claire Jones on 25 June and 20 September, and published on 30 September 2019","Your new headquarters is very impressive.[end_question] What is the legacy you feel you leave behind?[end_question] Before you became ECB president, you were in Frankfurt often as governor of the Banca d’Italia. Did it strike you before you joined the ECB that there needed to be the sort of changes that we’ve seen you make.[end_question] Within a few weeks of moving here you took your first action when you cut rates. What were those first few months like?[end_question] [end_question] [end_question] You didn’t necessarily expect to become the ECB president.[end_question] It was a twist of fate. Were you ready for the job?[end_question] Did you have a plan?[end_question] But you did have an unusual array of experiences: financial markets, central banking experience, treasury, international, economic policymaking, and regulation. It’s pretty formidable. But on the other hand you were Italian.[end_question] You said we were heading into a crisis pretty fast by the time you took over. So at that point you had to draw up a strategy.[end_question] Tell us how you got consensus.[end_question] Did that worry you; that you had a rump set of dissidents?[end_question] [end_question] When investors came on board; yes. How much time did you actually try to spend convincing these dissenting voices?[end_question] What was – in your view – your decisive argument?[end_question] Of course that’s the central story in European integration, isn’t it? A figure like Helmut Kohl certainly understood that this was not a one-country world, in the very telling phrase you’ve just used.[end_question] So was this an institutional mindset or a national mindset?[end_question] Yes, this is why new instruments were required.[end_question] [end_question] Who were your most important allies at this point? We all need friends. We all need people who are empathetic.[end_question] So was there a tacit deal with Berlin that you can be criticised in private, but in public whatever you say is fine?[end_question] If you look at the evolution of this crisis, though, it became a sovereign debt crisis and so then you were faced with even more critical decisions with at least one member state in grave peril and in fact the Eurozone as a result in peril.[end_question] Yes. It was a real balancing act; a tightrope act.[end_question] Did you do a study, though, on the consequences of Greece leaving the euro?[end_question] Why?[end_question] It’s good to hear that. But on Greece clearly there was quite a bit of pressure to say, you know what, let them go.[end_question] Basically that was calling their bluff.[end_question] What do you say to those critics, some of which are in the UK on the left, who say Greece has paid a terrible price for both joining the euro and indeed staying in the euro?[end_question] Can we go back to this famous dramatic event in London? History has been rewritten, hasn’t it? Because you didn’t actually plan to say it like this.[end_question] [end_question] So to be clear, you did intend to make some kind of statement.[end_question] So once you’d said this and it had a market reaction, did you have a clear plan then of what you were going to do to back it up?[end_question] The sense is now that it has acted as a nuclear deterrent. You never really needed to draw on it because markets find it so convincing. Were you convinced yourself at the point you created it that markets wouldn’t test it?[end_question] [end_question] Yes. That was the genius of it. Did you figure that it might have a chance of working that way?[end_question] And of course OMT was crucially upheld in the court.[end_question] To call a cat a cat, if you’re looking at your tenure do you think you’ve had any impact on German public opinion? Well, the ECB. Let’s not personalise it.[end_question] [end_question] [end_question] I’ve lived in Germany myself for two years. Why does one hear so much dissent on monetary policy?[end_question] We need to talk about today. First of all, if you look at your ammunition chest, how much have you got left?[end_question] So Mr Macron is right to call for a common European budget?[end_question] It needs to be complemented.[end_question] That’s crucial. That’s the huge lesson, isn’t it? That’s your message in Sintra, but is it politically feasible? How do you get around the German objections?[end_question] Try 25 years.[end_question] Yes. I’ve read the speech twice and it’s very good, but this fiscal point is crucial. Do you think a new generation of leaders is required to accept this?[end_question] .[end_question] Now, at this point, Jacob Rees-Mogg says, ‘I told you so, it’s the United States of Europe, it’s federalism’.[end_question] It’s still a hybrid.[end_question] Yes, because this is coming from a central banker who has managed existential crises. But do you think a majority share this view in the council on the fiscal capacity question?[end_question] There’s a serious point here about what you said in Sintra. You clearly say, we’ve been flying almost on one engine, right?[end_question] What do you think, then? Nobody knows what the next crises are, but could things get even rougher in the next phase?[end_question] Did it worry you when you were attacked by Trump the other day?[end_question] Does Trump worry you?[end_question] But in general, this has been the most extraordinary period where the central banks have actually had to rescue the system, so to speak, and we’ve had this persistent low inflation. Inflationary expectations are lower than just before you launched QE.[end_question] So the question is, how do you get out of this deflationary mentality and indeed the low interest rate environment?[end_question] Do you still think a hard Brexit is a possibility?[end_question] It has gone up, but there’s no Plan B. Or is there?[end_question] Just in terms of the populist climate, there does seem to be a common vein that they are attacking central banks and attacking central banks’ independence. What do you do in response to that?[end_question] So I’ve got to find a way of asking politely, all great leaders think about their succession…Yes. It’s a political decision, but how far do you feel what you say and do now is in effect intended to exert influence beyond your tenure?[end_question] So just thinking ahead, if you had to identify the two or three things you’re very concerned about now and possibly contingencies, what would they be?[end_question] Good. Can I ask you a parochial question? What is the impact going to be of Britain leaving the European Union politically and economically?[end_question] Is it going to change the geopolitical dynamics?[end_question] There are still some concerns that when you depart, when another person is sitting in your chair, that the market might pay more attention to them having to operate ‘within our mandate’, rather than your willingness to do ‘whatever it takes’. So is the OMT watertight? Do we have a true lender of last resort facility for the Eurozone or do you still need a safe pair of hands in Frankfurt and in Berlin and other European capitals?[end_question] What is your opinion on the nomination of Christine Lagarde as your successor? Is it a disadvantage that Ms Lagarde has no formal training as an economist?[end_question] There is a growing feeling that central banks, including the ECB, have shouldered too much of the burden and can no longer be the only game in town. Is the era of the omnipotent central banker past its peak?[end_question] The ECB has undershot its inflation target much more than other central banks. Why is that?[end_question] There has been a backlash against the most recent package by some of your colleagues. Why did you want to do such a big package? The bigger the package, the bigger the reaction?[end_question] On the euro, the house is still standing but it is a bit rickety.[end_question] It just needs a new extension?[end_question] You don’t think we could go backwards?","The following is an edited transcript of the interview.[end_answer] Yes and it is also symbolic as it embodies our values. Transparency and independence.[end_answer] The ECB’s response to the crisis was crucial in preserving the euro and keeping the European Monetary Union together and always respecting its mandate.[end_answer] Furthermore, the ECB is nowadays a very different institution from the past. The existential challenges that it had to cope with have profoundly transformed it both as far as monetary policy and other key tasks are concerned, but also in its managerial and operational structure. Finally, there is a clear message now that can inspire future work on strengthening our Union. Without a significant fiscal policy for the whole of the Eurozone, this Union will remain a fragile construction.[end_answer] The extent of the crisis was clear to me. The contagion had spread throughout the euro area periphery, the banking crisis was peaking with bank runs pushing some banks to the brink of failure, dollar liquidity was insufficient. But as soon as I moved here the policy analysis was wider. The scope of possible actions is much larger than at the national level, the initiative to act springs from this.[end_answer] It was a natural response to immediately lower interest rates once and then a second time, and then introduce the LTRO. The LTROs were not completely without precedent, there had been similar longer-term credit lines. The difference was that these were for three years, and the terms and conditions were much easier. The collateral rules were changed too, some of the earlier experience showed that with certain collateral rules these credit lines might not have been accessed.[end_answer] No.[end_answer] I don't know. Up to others to judge.[end_answer] I had been governor for six years. I was chair of the FSB, previously the FSF. But did I ask myself, ‘Am I ready? Do I know the nuts and bolts?’; no, I haven’t asked myself these questions.[end_answer] I don't think that ever played a significant role in this. But I should say that the six previous years I had spent in institutions like Banca d’Italia and the FSB, the latter of which had led the regulatory response to the great financial crisis at a global level, were a good preparation for chairing the decision-making process of the Governing Council.[end_answer] As a president, with extensive discussions with the staff and the ECB chief economist, one gathers a deep view of the whole Eurozone, encompassing national views. Bringing this to the Governing Council, together with the collegial exchanges – where participants may be expected to change their minds if facts warrant it – is of utmost importance. That’s why it’s essential that participants should not have dogmatic monetary policy views that cannot be adapted when the facts warrant it.[end_answer] I think this method worked really well. Of course it becomes harder during a crisis, especially in a heterogeneous zone like the Eurozone, where you have countries that have been doing -- by and large -- well throughout the crisis and other countries that have done very poorly.[end_answer] A crisis so dramatic required a powerful monetary policy response with all the then available instruments, including non-conventional ones.[end_answer] Between February and March 2012, through the three-year LTROs, we avoided a major banking crisis in the Eurozone which would have had devastating effects in many countries in the Eurozone, and we had to face resistance and criticism even at this early stage.[end_answer] There was no consensus. These were all majority decisions, but there was a very clear majority since the beginning.[end_answer] This view -- that we could not act without unanimity, especially at times without the largest member countries -- played a bigger role at the beginning. But then, especially after the London speech was welcomed by the majority of the Governing Council, this view faded away. The London speech was a defining moment for that reason too.[end_answer] Time is always necessary, especially when the waters where the Governing Council was to navigate were unchartered. And my colleagues and I still spend a lot of time discussing where we go, what we want to do, and so on.[end_answer] My argument was that they should try to see that this is not a one-country world, that this is a more complex reality than just one country. And monetary policy should be designed accordingly. I think this is the key.[end_answer] Yes. He certainly did, as does Chancellor Merkel.[end_answer] This mindset is the product of success. You had a prestigious institution, the Bundesbank, with a successful monetary policy 20 to 50 years ago – when almost everyone else in the world was making one policy mistake after another. But with the euro we had entered a new world. And this world was changing fast.[end_answer] Furthermore, after the great financial crisis the Eurozone had low inflation and the highest level of unemployment, probably since the Great Depression. The financial system became fragmented and monetary policy was no longer effectively transmitted. In those years, changes in interest rates would no longer be transmitted into lending rates to the private sector.[end_answer] First, most colleagues in the Governing Council, otherwise I wouldn’t have had a constant large majority for eight years. Second, the leaders of Europe with their continuous understanding of the gravity of the crisis. Third, the supporting opinion of most economists and policymakers, especially the ones who had gone through similarly difficult situations in the US, UK and Japan.[end_answer] The European Council has always been quite supportive. I’m regularly invited and I am asked to give a presentation of the economic situation of the euro area and on occasion they could have made criticisms — after all, some finance ministers were not shy of making clear their viewpoints. Never in the European Council; I don't think I remember one occasion when there was even veiled criticism towards our policies.[end_answer] No, there was no deal, either tacit or implicit. There has been a completely independent relationship. Never a quid pro quo.[end_answer] The debt crisis had already exploded before my coming here. Then we had Greece, which again went close to default in 2015. On that occasion again the ECB was pretty successful in taking a policy line that maintained the unity of the euro while preventing blatant violations of the Treaty at the same time.[end_answer] We had two sets of diametrically opposed criticisms there. One was that we should have cut Greece off any line of financing immediately, which would have implied the full collapse of the Greek economy and likely exit of Greece out of the euro; and the other one saying that we should have provided unlimited, unconditional liquidity to the Greek government and the Greek economy no matter what.[end_answer] The support given to Greece was substantial. At its peak the combined lending of the ECB and Bank of Greece to Greek banks reached €127 billion or 71% of the country’s GDP. We did this while the first group of critics was suggesting we should have cut all lines immediately. We continued to finance the private sector with safeguards to make sure that there was no further financing of the state. There was no monetary financing. It was all in all the right way to go because we managed to both keep the euro intact and also avoid circumventing the Treaty.[end_answer] As Peter Praet reminded us at the time, this implied two major changesto the governance of ELA interventions: first, the duration of assistance lengthened; second, the scope of assistance broadened from individual institutions to entire banking systems.[end_answer] Yes. It was not easy at all.[end_answer] Our job is to look at contingencies. But let me be very clear, on the euro, there was no Plan B.[end_answer] Because the ECB has been created with the mandate to maintain price stability and price stability is founded on the existence of the euro. Otherwise it has no meaning if there is no euro. Which price stability or which currency are we supposed to maintain? The dollar? No. The pound? No. It’s the euro. So that’s why there’s no Plan B.[end_answer] Yes, but I did say this openly in a Eurogroup to a minister who was suggesting or hinting that we should have cut them off a long time ago. I said: ‘Look, if you want to push Greece out of the euro, you do it. Don’t use the ECB to do it.’[end_answer] The country was coming from an unsustainable debt financed bubble. The collapse was extraordinarily large and the crisis was terrible. It was overcome first thanks to what the Greek citizens had been able to achieve. But solidarity in the Eurozone has been beneficial. It is very difficult for an isolated country which defaults to go back to normal. The euro area actions have helped Greece, which grew at 1.8% on average over the last eight quarters, with income per capita, after falling roughly 23% from 2008 to 2016, now growing again at 1.6% in 2018, and private investment resuming.[end_answer] Well history did turn out differently from what people in the room expected. Some of that had to do with the sense that the overall situation was very serious. Spreads everywhere had widened. The exchange rate was depreciating not because of any other reason than a lack of confidence in our ability to act decisively. The financial system and banking system were widely fragmented.[end_answer] There had also been steps forward in the previous European Council in June with the launching of the banking union which, together with the just established European crisis mechanism and improved economic governance framework, strengthened EMU. Though these decisions certainly helped, and in fact were mostly based on proposals made by the ECB in the previous three years, the substance of the London speech was fully independent of the Council decisions. There was no deal.[end_answer] So there had been a remarkable display of unity by the leaders in taking actions that would eventually make our monetary union stronger.[end_answer] I had reflected, consulted and deeply thought about the appropriate message. I knew I had to make it absolutely clear that the ECB would do whatever was necessary, that only bringing certainty to markets that the ECB was unwavering would put a halt to the downward spiral. I was determined to make that point forcefully. And the markets did the rest.[end_answer] A strong commitment to intervene in an unlimited fashion supported by an equally credible commitment of the country concerned. Given the experience with SMP, that commitment needed to be clearly spelled out and backed by a programme with the then EFSF, now the ESM.[end_answer] The message was expected to calm the markets, but I also knew this message would be sustained if the countries undertook reforms needed to cement those lower spreads and to produce sustainable growth.[end_answer] That pronouncement of the ECJ confirmed the legitimacy of our actions.[end_answer] The euro is as popular today as ever before in its 20-year history.[end_answer] This reaction, which contrasts with the general approval that our measures received in the rest of the world, might partly be explained by the novelty of our measures, and partly by the way central banks’ communications channels work in the eurozone. Banks, insurance companies, pension funds, business models and savers’ behaviours needed to adapt to QE and negative interest rates and this wasn’t easy. We were fulfilling our duty; the Treaty is asking us to take the actions we are taking to preserve the stability of the euro.[end_answer] Also, explanation of our policies to the citizens of the eurozone relies on national central bank communication. Whenever they supported Governing Council decisions at national level, public opinion at country level was also supportive. Once a decision is taken, dissent should stay within the Governing Council.[end_answer] All instruments from interest rates to asset purchases, to forward guidance are ready to be calibrated. We also need to reiterate that we are symmetric in pursuing our objective, i.e. that to keep inflation above our target as much as below it.[end_answer] Also, in the future, if the experience is telling us anything, it is this: we have to have a fiscal policy of some significance in the Eurozone. The first time I mentioned this was in a speech I gave in Jackson Hole in 2014 and I repeated it thereafter several times. I always mention the fact of the need to move from a rules-based national fiscal policy to an institution-based fiscal capacity. We have countries that have fiscal space and don’t use it. Even if they were to do something, what would be useful to the rest of the euro area would only be the spill-overs. This means that steering the aggregate euro area fiscal stance in an optimal way through decentralised policies is difficult to achieve given that national policies are geared to national stabilisation needs. Furthermore what is clear is that the current composition of euro area fiscal policies is not optimal. Countries with fiscal space could use some of it to strengthen public investment and increase their growth potential. Member states with high debt with few exceptions are not building buffers needed to provide fiscal stabilisation during the next downturn.[end_answer] Monetary policy can do its job, but in the absence of a stabilisation capacity it will only do it more slowly and with more side effects. A combination of monetary and fiscal policies might have delivered similar results on growth and inflation, but faster and at a higher level of interest rates.[end_answer] Yes it does.[end_answer] This is certainly valid. This objection has been there now for many years.[end_answer] There are no lasting monetary unions without fiscal risk sharing both because convergence cannot be perfectly achieved and because regions may be subject to idiosyncratic shocks. Mundell and Bordo have provided extensive evidence that fiscal policy is indispensable to monetary unions. This may be another long journey, perhaps as long as the journey towards the euro was, because of the present political difficulties. But fixing a long-term roadmap to that objective would send a powerful signal that would strengthen the euro area and may even provide additional policy space.[end_answer] There are lots of other things that still remain in the national remit.[end_answer] Like all unions. Given the inherent weakness of nation states in a globalised world, what matters is to make the union stronger. In some areas further integration achieves this goal, in others, it is the preservation of the national identities that serves the purpose.[end_answer] In the Governing Council we discuss monetary policy not fiscal policy but my guess is that many governors would share the same viewpoint. In the European Council they discuss fiscal policy and the last Five Presidents’ Report offered some thoughts on this.[end_answer] Yes, definitely. Everything becomes more difficult.[end_answer] From an institutional point of view the EMU is stronger than it was before the crisis. We have the banking union, the capital markets union, and so on. Also the economy is now doing better and most of our risks are produced by events that are taking place outside the eurozone, think about trade disputes, Brexit, geopolitical tensions, where we are on the receiving end. Of course, we have our own political fragilities, as one would expect from a union with nineteen democracies.[end_answer] No.[end_answer] I was not worried.[end_answer] Yes.[end_answer] The answer is to persist with monetary policy. Although, as I said before, fiscal policy could greatly help. We mentioned maintaining the extraordinary stimulus, and this may have to last a long time if there is no support from fiscal policy. Having said that, inflation expectations are actually going down everywhere.[end_answer] There is a structural component which keeps inflation low because otherwise it would only be a eurozone phenomenon. I’m not saying this with any degree of complacency, by the way. We’ve got to continue being persistent, patient, prudent.[end_answer] The situation is improving, nominal wages are now growing at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent for the euro area and more in certain core countries. This sooner or later will translate itself into higher inflation. It’s just taking longer than we thought.[end_answer] It would not be for me to venture into hypothesis, but simply if you compare the likelihood of hard Brexit today with what it was four months ago, one has to admit it has gone up.[end_answer] We have addressed all the possible contingencies within our remit and we worked extensively for three years with the Bank of England. But of course being such a broad-ranging event, risks remain.[end_answer] Central banks were made independent because independence is the pillar of their credibility. The best response is therefore to continue to pursue our mandate. If central banks deliver what they’ve been tasked to do, that’s the best answer to some of these concerns. It is also essential to explain better and better what we do. Communication again.[end_answer] Frankly I think it would be a mistake to reverse central bank independence. I’ve lived in periods when central banks were not independent and it was definitely worse.[end_answer] Succession is a fact enshrined in the Treaty. Decisions about it are a political task. My duty is only to continue to serve the mandate until the very end of my term.[end_answer] Growth has weakened in most advanced economies, especially where trade and manufacturing are important, such as Germany and Japan, with GDP growth projected to be at or below 1% in both countries this year. Global trade volume growth has slowed abruptly, from around 5.7% in 2017 to around 1.4% in the first quarter of 2019, in year-on-year terms. Near term trade prospects remain weak.[end_answer] It’s going to be a loss for the European Union from all viewpoints and I think there is nothing more to add to that.[end_answer] Too difficult to guess which way.[end_answer] Yes OMT is watertight, as well as other key decisions taken by the Governing Council during these years. Of course, all policy decisions depend on the circumstances, but I have no reason to think that people who will be sitting in those chairs in the coming years will interpret the mandate in a way different from what the Governing Council that met in the summer of 2012 actually did.[end_answer] She will be an outstanding ECB president and I say so with full knowledge, having known her for longer than she and I want to remember. She has successfully led the IMF and its staff of economists through challenging times. Also, there are many similarities between the way decisions are taken at the ECB and at the IMF. As I said earlier in our discussion, work at the ECB is collegial, relying on extensive discussions with the staff and the chief economist, as well as the rest of the Governing Council. This is not so different to how the IMF works. Ms Lagarde and the ECB are very well equipped for the next eight years.[end_answer] I talked about fiscal policy as a necessary complement to monetary policy since 2014. Now the need is more urgent than before. Monetary policy will continue to do its job but the negative side effects as you move forward are more and more visible.[end_answer] Have we done enough? Yes, we have done enough -- and we can do more. But more to the point what is missing? The answer is fiscal policy. That’s the big difference between Europe and the US.[end_answer] Disagreements about policy happen everywhere, not just in Europe. The outlook has worsened, especially for manufacturing. Inflation was no longer on track to meet our target. And our policies will continue to work, albeit at a slower pace than if governments were spending more.[end_answer] The house is not rickety. What I see looking back is progress on banking union, on capital markets union -- but EMU is still incomplete.[end_answer] To have a stronger EMU we need a common eurozone budget. Clearly the political debate on that still has a long way to go. But I am optimistic. Many more people understand the importance of these reforms than a few years ago -- there will at some point be a commitment.[end_answer] No. People have understood the benefits of the single currency. Trust is going up. The opponents of the euro have not succeeded.","['low inflation', 'keep inflation above', 'inflation expectations are actually going down', 'keeps inflation low', 'higher inflation']","['Furthermore,

295,2019-07-08,Interview with BFM Business TV,Benoît Cœuré,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2019/html/ecb.in190708~a8dcfa84eb.en.html,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Hedwige Chevrillon, published on 9 July 2019","Mr Cœuré[end_question] In what way?[end_question] There are many economists here in Aix. You are a distinguished economist with a fine reputation. It has been pointed out, with some justification, that Christine Lagarde doesn’t have a technical background in economics, or in monetary policy. Do we need to worry about the future of monetary policy in Europe?[end_question] Yes, but the first one of you – and that would be you, Mr Cœuré – you may, for legal reasons, for reasons of nationality, end up leaving the ECB. This is worrying a lot of people, I won’t hide it from you, even people here, who are saying that if Benoit Cœuré were to leave, having been one of the main architects of the current monetary policy framework, that would leave a huge void at the ECB.[end_question] Isn’t the biggest challenge the question of the team, the future team surrounding Christine Lagarde?[end_question] As you said yourself, you’re going to be leaving the ECB. Are you a candidate to become Managing Director of the IMF?[end_question] Listening to the statements made by Mario Draghi, one has the impression that he is inclined to continue the ECB’s current interest rate policy, meaning a policy of very low interest rates. That policy is giving rise to considerable side effects, which we will discuss. Do you think this policy will be in place for a long time?[end_question] But what if there is deflation with this interest rate policy?[end_question] But what monetary tools do you have at your disposal if you do need to act?[end_question] But what are the circumstances? There are lots of questions about the circumstances. Is it the growth rate? The rate of inflation? A lack of inflation? I used something of a dirty word before when I referred to deflation. I apologise for that, but at the same time, isn’t it a kind of sword of Damocles hanging over you?[end_question] What some people are worried about – and we talk about a lot here – is the possibility of a financial crisis, even a financial explosion, whether in the short or medium term I don’t know. Maybe you will give us a time scale. Is there a risk of the bubble bursting or a liquidity crisis on the horizon?[end_question] That’s already the case...[end_question] Do you think we need to create new regulatory instruments for this non-bank finance?[end_question] Do you think the chances of a cyber attack are quite high? It’s fairly logical given that we’re already seeing cyber attacks against companies…[end_question] Has the ECB already experienced a major, significant cyber attack?[end_question] So no “massive” attack?[end_question] You talked about this parallel finance that is becoming increasingly important; there is also a huge amount of money flowing into private equity. Why? Because there is not enough money to be made anywhere else? Is that an amber warning light for you?[end_question] And when exactly will we have a financial crisis? In the relatively short term? Maybe as a central banker you can’t say…[end_question] There is a major economic debate around the topic of “low rate policies mean we have to completely revisit our traditional macroeconomic models”. Olivier Blanchard, in particular, has been vocal, but not just him... Olivier Blanchard, the former IMF chief economist, whom you know well. Shouldn’t we revisit our macroeconomic criteria? Can’t debt help, as long as it takes the form of infrastructure investment?[end_question] The idea is that current policy is causing countries to pursue a rather tight fiscal policy, particularly as regards the level of debt…[end_question] Can we permanently have such low interest rates and no return on savings?[end_question] So you don’t see a risk in this policy over the long term? Is there no systemic risk?[end_question] Yes, the question is the long term, isn’t it?[end_question] Another issue that’s very important because it has, and will have, a huge impact is cryptocurrencies, like the famous Libra, which will be launched by Facebook with the backing of large investors. As chair of the working group on these currencies, do you see them as a threat or, on the contrary, as an evolution of traditional currencies?[end_question] Yes, an elephant![end_question] They do more than challenge them; couldn’t they put them at risk?[end_question] Currencies are normally minted by states. Don’t you find it shocking that a private concern is “minting currency”, so to speak?[end_question] It’s a means of payment…[end_question] So you have no concerns about these currencies?[end_question] Benoit Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, thank you for this interview.","It’s an excellent choice. It’s an excellent choice because Christine Lagarde’s career, first in France and then at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, makes her eminently qualified to be President of the ECB.[end_answer] She understands perfectly how the global economy works, and how the euro area economy works; she knows how to speak to the financial markets; she knows the institutional set-up in the euro area. So she will do an extremely good job.[end_answer] No. It’s a criticism that has been made of Christine Lagarde, but she knows the economy very well – she has led the IMF, she has been finance minister, so she knows how the economy works. In addition, she will have, a team of excellent ECB economists who will work alongside her and advise her, and she will manage things very well.[end_answer] I’ll be leaving the ECB on 31 December 2019 because that’s when my eight-year term comes to an end. Irrespective of Christine Lagarde’s appointment, I’ll be staying until the end of December, until the end of my term. The ECB’s chief economist, my colleague Philip Lane – who was previously Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland – is an excellent macroeconomist and he will be able to steer things extremely well.[end_answer] It’s a challenge that everyone faces when they take on a new role, of course. But she will make good decisions.[end_answer] No, I’m not a candidate for the IMF. There are plenty of good candidates. Don’t ask me who my preferred candidate would be, because the decision is not up to me. My speciality is Europe, and so I’d rather stay in Europe and continue to serve Europe. The way in which I do so remains to be seen; there are various ways. But I’m not a candidate for the IMF.[end_answer] It’s a policy that has side effects, and this is something that we are monitoring. We are aware of the side effects, but our policy is necessary. Why is that? It’s because our objective is to ensure that inflation comes back to our objective which is close to, but below 2%, and we’re not there yet. So, monetary policy needs to be accommodative until that objective is met.[end_answer] It’s a policy which has created tens of millions of jobs in the euro area, which is supporting activity and thus a return of inflation towards 2%, and which is all the more necessary right now, when we are facing a slowdown in the global economy and significant global risks – which are not related to Europe, but rather to trade tensions caused by various countries, and which are affecting confidence. In this environment, an accommodative monetary policy is needed more than ever. The Governing Council of the ECB has said that we are ready to act if new downside risks materialise. So, the policy is necessary to fulfil our mandate.[end_answer] We have used various tools up until now: the forward guidance, through which we steer monetary policy expectations; interest rates, which are very low and which we have said we would be ready to lower further still, if necessary – and I always stress “if necessary”; and the reinvestment of our securities portfolio, which ensures that the ECB has a very significant presence in the markets. And theoretically, we could also resume making net asset purchases, again if warranted by the circumstances.[end_answer] There is no deflation in the euro area; we are not talking about a risk of deflation. Inflation is well above zero. The risk is that a series of negative shocks might move us further away from our objective of 2% – that is what we are looking at, what we are trying to understand, particularly in the light of the global economy.[end_answer] There are always risks in the financial sector, and as central bankers we are paid to worry about them. The role of central bankers and regulators is to worry about risks. Our first conclusion is that we have to maintain and protect the system of financial regulation that has been built since the great financial crisis, since 2007-08. As time goes by, people are tending to forget this crisis, and the temptation returns – particularly under the pressure of different lobby groups – to relax financial regulation. This temptation must be resisted, both in terms of banking and finance more generally.[end_answer] Then we have to identify the new risks. I see two main risks; there are many but I would like to highlight two of them. First, we have the risk that part of the financial sector slips out of the domain of banks and into the domain of non-banks.[end_answer] Yes, it’s already the case. The size of banks is now under control; the large banks are handling risk much better than they were before the crisis. But the price to pay for that has been that part of the financial sector has moved to the domain of non-banks – investment funds, money market funds, etc. – which is regulated differently, where we don’t have the so-called macroprudential instruments, in other words, a way to control the bubbles, as one might say. These instruments barely exist, or don’t even exist at all, in the domain of market-based finance. That’s a challenge for regulators, particularly for the next cycle of European regulation over the next five years.[end_answer] Yes, exactly. And the second risk I see – which is of a different nature – is cyber risk, the risk linked to cyber attacks. At the ECB, and elsewhere in Europe, we are paying close attention to this issue. We can’t rule out the fact that the next financial crisis may come from a cyber attack on a big financial institution or a financial infrastructure. It’s our priority to prevent this risk.[end_answer] Ask any company director; there are thousands of cyber attacks every day. We’re being tested all the time, including at the ECB. It’s part of being a company. But the financial system has weak points – there are systemic infrastructures that could be targeted by cyber attacks. At the ECB we’ve reacted by creating a forum – the Euro Cyber Resilience Board – which assesses the resilience of major European infrastructures. We’ve also reacted at the level of the G7, with a recent cyber crisis coordination exercise.[end_answer] We experience thousands of small ones every day, like everyone…[end_answer] Not for now, no. No significant attack. But it will come, and we have to be ready.[end_answer] Not private equity specifically, no. But there are other areas we are monitoring at euro area level, like real estate financing, which is not a problem in general, but there are small warning signs in certain countries. There are also these so-called leveraged loans – more in the United States than in Europe – but which are starting to become a global problem. So there are a number of warning lights that are starting to flash on the global dashboard. These are signs of financial fragility and we’re keeping a close eye on them.[end_answer] I don’t know how to answer that question. My job is to make sure the financial system is as robust as possible. At the level of the financial institutions themselves, that’s the work of the banking supervisors, my colleagues at the ECB who supervise the banks, who check that they have enough capital and liquidity to withstand a crisis, and at the level of big global infrastructures like payment systems and clearing systems.[end_answer] I didn’t interpret Olivier Blanchard as saying that we had to radically change our economic models, quite the contrary. What he said was that, within the framework of our traditional models, there are indicators, or parameters, that have changed, especially the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate, which is very different from how it has been in the past and that, he says, warrants a policy of re-indebtedness in certain countries.[end_answer] That does not call for a change in economic theory; it is actually in line with standard economic theory. The parameters have simply changed because interest rates are lower than before. I think he is basically right, but the analysis needs to be done for each country individually. In Europe we would need to carefully identify those countries where interest rates will be persistently low relative to growth rates. I don’t think that countries such as Italy, or even France, fall into that group. Interest rates have indeed fallen but they will climb up again one day, and long-term growth rates – potential growth rates as economists would say – are rather low. And the European Commission’s assessment, like our own at the ECB, is that there are actually very few countries in Europe with the resources to actively deploy fiscal policy. Germany is one of them but France and Italy are not.[end_answer] Yes, people are earning a lower return on their savings, but savers are employees and consumers too. And the low interest rate policy has enabled a revival in employment and a recovery in economic activity, which also boost savings.[end_answer] Our current monetary policy is designed to respond to a very specific situation, namely to a low growth, low inflation environment which should not last forever. Monetary normalisation will have to set in at some point, but the prospect of that normalisation is moving a little further away. That’s because of the risks for the global economy generated by shocks in the United States, in China and in the global trade system. So for the moment, this prospect of normalisation will need to be slightly postponed, but I am convinced that normalisation will have to occur eventually.[end_answer] We conduct monetary policy based on the data at our disposal and we now see a slowdown in the global economy.[end_answer] A G7 working group on stable coins, set up at the request of the French presidency, will present an initial report to the meeting of the G7 in Chantilly in around ten days’ time. Stable coins are a global topic affecting all countries, so work will also be carried out at the level of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board. I think we need a balanced approach to this question; it obviously involves many and varied dimensions of risks, which makes this debate rather complex. There are risks related to anti-money laundering, the anonymity of transactions and the use of these instruments for illicit transactions. And there are financial stability risks and risks relating to the use of the personal data that are generated by these transactions. So we need a multi-disciplinary approach and, most of all, we need a coherent approach at global level, because these are projects which have a global dimension from the outset. The difference between these new projects and the fintechs, as they are traditionally known, is that we have been looking at small projects in what are known as regulatory “sandboxes” and, now, we have an elephant entering the sandbox. That is the issue. So we need to understand what this elephant looks like.[end_answer] We need to understand the elephant. But we also need to look at the opportunities, the advances offered by these technologies. They pose a challenge to the traditional banking system, which has not been quick enough to seize the new technologies, particularly in the field of payments.[end_answer] Yes, but a technological innovation enabling less costly and quicker international payments is a welcome innovation. Banks need to react and adapt to it, but innovation in itself is a good thing. And it demands a response from us central banks too. Our instant payments projects at the ECB are a case in point. At the ECB we now have an instant payments system known as TIPS which is inexpensive and works extremely well. We need to learn to link these systems with our colleagues in other countries to facilitate cross-border payments. Innovation is also an incentive, a stimulus that enables us to work more effectively.[end_answer] We are not talking about currency, but rather what is known as ‘’stable coins’’.[end_answer] They are payment systems, a means of payment as you say, but they may eventually evolve to become financial instruments, perhaps even debt or funding instruments. We will identify all these functionalities and we will have to have a regulation for each functionality such that equivalent activities are regulated in the same way, regardless of the technology behind them.[end_answer] They are not currencies. There is only one currency in the euro area, only one which is legal tender, and that is the euro. There is no other.","['inflation comes back', 'return of inflation', 'risk of deflation', 'low inflation']","['It’s because our objective is to ensure that inflation comes back to our objective which

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Aapo Parviainen and broadcast on 1 July 2019","What are the alternatives to fight for the euro when recession hits the euro area next time?[end_question] Do we have to accept these negative interest rates looking forward?[end_question] Can you give a time estimation?[end_question] What about inflation then? It’s far from target.[end_question] But there is no need to change the target?[end_question] Looking at the world economy now, how big a risk is this trade war?[end_question] If we take another risk – Brexit – how do you see that?[end_question] And your favourite deal is?[end_question] In Finland we always compare ourselves to Sweden. When this first crisis hit Sweden they kept doing well and Finland not so well, and then comes this question of if it has been a good idea at all to be a member of Economic and Monetary Union. How do you see this?[end_question] One personal question. You are an academic, how do you see your new position now as Chief Economist? Your position is very important in the ECB.","What I said today at the conference is the ECB has been creative in developing a toolkit, moving the interest rate below zero, being active in purchasing government debts, special lending programmes for banks and also communicating about future policies. Taken together this has worked quite well, it’s worked quite well so far and I’m confident if there is a downturn more can be done. So if you like the main conclusion of my talk today is that we should be confident that even under these conditions the ECB has the policy measures to allow it to respond to shocks to the economy, shocks to inflation. Being a central bank is a very powerful institution, the ability to influence financial conditions is quite extensive and so we should be confident about the effectiveness of our policies at the ECB.[end_answer] I think we should view this as a temporary measure. The negative interest rate allows more spending by firms, more spending by households. By allowing the European economy to grow more quickly when the economy has recovered then the interest rate will turn positive again. So not forever but for a while.[end_answer] It depends on what happens, as you know the world is quite uncertain, we have a baseline forecast which remains optimistic for Europe but we recognise there are downside risks.[end_answer] Well I think we have to take a measured approach. Compared to say 2014 there’s been a good recovery of inflation, so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards. But as you say it’s still not yet at the objective level. So we continue to have a lot of accommodation and we have said that if there are further negative shocks, we can do more. So I think it’s important to be in the middle, inflation is recovering, we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over.[end_answer] The target is, I think, not at the centre of any issue right now. At the centre right now are the shocks hitting the world economy and the importance of the ECB to respond to those shocks.[end_answer] So I think it is important to recognise that domestically the European economy has many positives. By the way the trade war does not extend to the Single Market, most trade in the European Union, most trade for Finland, a lot of that is going to be with the other members of the European Union, which has no trade war. But unfortunately the trade war, the trade discussion between China and the United States does carry risks for the European economy and many firms here in Finland sell to Asia, to America, many firms across Europe, so the quicker this trade dispute is settled the better for the European economy.[end_answer] Again we have a situation now where there is a lot of uncertainty. Either we will have a Brexit that is negotiated or we have a no-deal Brexit or there are other scenarios. So I think in the coming weeks and months we’ll get some answers, this cannot go on forever. I think everyone is indicating we need to come to a conclusion and once that conclusion is reached – especially if there is a reasonable negotiation, a reasonable outcome – then uncertainty will be reduced and that can be good news. On the other hand if it’s a no-deal Brexit that will cause more disruption.[end_answer] Well again it’s up to the politicians. As for the ECB we will just respond to whatever happens. It’s up to the political leaders of the United Kingdom to finalise Brexit.[end_answer] So I’m a very big fan of the euro. I think it’s pretty important to recognise that without the ECB the crisis we had would have been worse. Imagine the crisis of those years without a powerful shared central bank. If we had had 19 separate currencies during the crisis the outcome would have been worse. Especially for small countries, the euro provides a lot of stability. I think increasingly as you know in the surveys the euro is very popular and I think that assessment by the European population is correct. It is a very good invention for Europe and I think for all of us in the euro area we should be proud of our common currency.[end_answer] So I think monetary economics, central banking is very closely connected to academia. One of the reasons the Bank of Finland is having this conference today is to recognise the importance of interaction between central bank officials like myself and university professors and students. This is an area where I’ve said in the speech the ECB has to be a learning organisation, we have to learn from our own research, from the university sector, from other central banks. So actually I think this is an area where I feel coming from a university background helps me in my current job.","['shocks to inflation', 'recovery of inflation', 'inflation is moving upwards', 'inflation is recovering']","['So if you like the main conclusion of my talk today is that we should be confident that even under these conditions the ECB has the policy measures to allow it to respond to shocks to the economy, shocks to inflation.', 'Compared to say 2014 there’s been a good recovery of inflation, so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards.', 'Compared to say 2014 there’s been a good recovery of inflation, so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards.', 'So I think it’s important to be in the middle, inflation is recovering, we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over.']",1969,M,Ireland,2019 -,"['so if you like the main conclusion of my talk today be that we should be confident that even under these condition the ECB have the policy measure to allow it to respond to shock to the economy shock to inflation ', 'compare to say there s be a good recovery of inflation so compare to the risk in year by year inflation be move upwards ', 'so I think its important to be in the middle inflation be recover we expect it to continue to recover but the job be not over ']","['so if you like the main conclusion of my talk today be that we should be confident that even under these condition the ECB have the policy measure to allow it to respond to shock to the economy shock to inflation ', 'compare to say there s be a good recovery of inflation so compare to the risk in year by year inflation be move upwards ', 'so I think its important to be in the middle inflation be recover we expect it to continue to recover but the job be not over ']",3,3,4667,"[('inflation', 'move')]",1,"['So if you like the main conclusion of my talk today is that we should be confident that even under these conditions the ECB has the policy measures to allow it to respond to shocks to the economy shocks to inflation.', 'Compared to say 2014 theres been a good recovery of inflation so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards.', 'So I think its important to be in the middle inflation is recovering we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over.']",4,3,"['compared to say 2014 theres been a good recovery of inflation so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards', 'so i think its important to be in the middle inflation is recovering we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over']","['orientation', 'disease']","[True, True]","[('inflation', 'move'), ('middle', 'inflation')]",['compared to say theres been a good recovery of inflation so compared to the risk in year by year inflation is moving upwards.'],2,"['warfare', 'disease', 'orientation', 'disease']",4,4,"['compared to say 2014 theres been a good recovery of inflation so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards', 'so i think its important to be in the middle inflation is recovering we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over']","['disease', 'disease']","['compared to say 2014 theres been a good recovery of inflation so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards', 'so i think its important to be in the middle inflation is recovering we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over']","['orientation', 'disease']","['compared to say 2014 theres been a good recovery of inflation so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards', 'so i think its important to be in the middle inflation is recovering we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over']","['orientation', 'disease']","['disease', 'disease']","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]","[True, True]"

Does that mean tiering is coming?[end_question] If the conversation has started, does it mean that interest rates will stay low for even longer?[end_question] Does tiering make the tool of negative interest rates less effective?[end_question] Now, German Bunds are yielding negative; is that a red flag for the ECB?[end_question] Are you particularly concerned about Germany?[end_question] What about Italy?[end_question] Talk to me about risks: there is China, there is trade, you mentioned Brexit. What is your biggest concern?[end_question] What can the ECB do to do that?[end_question] Do you have anything specific in mind?[end_question] The ECB have been working on a lending programme and I want to talk to you about timing. The announcement of the programme came a lot sooner than many people expected. The start of the programme will be somewhat later than people expected. Why is that?[end_question] Can you translate due time? How much time do you have?[end_question] You've talked to the banks about this tool in the past. Do you have any idea about take-up? What's your estimate?[end_question] Now, we've talked about the risks to the economy. You've talked about what you've done so far and what's in the pipeline. If the Eurozone was heading for a recession, if the situation deteriorates significantly, what's actually left for the ECB to do?[end_question] Is QE still a possible tool?[end_question] You are looking back to eight years at the ECB and I am just wondering, what was your worst possible day on the job?[end_question] Now, your successor is already known; Philip Lane from Ireland. Any preference as to who will replace Mario Draghi?","Praet: Well, I think don't rush. I think it's a bit premature to take that conclusion. What is clear now is that the perspective of low rates for longer has triggered that debate about the side effects of negative rates. I think it's fair to say that this issue has to be analysed carefully. But you need in any case to find a monetary policy case; you cannot just conclude let's do the theory because the economy is slowing down and the rates are low for longer. I think it's fair to say that we have to go into this issue but we need to have a convincing monetary policy case to do that.[end_answer] Now, when you look at the economy today and the lending channel, we don't see any particular problem in the lending channel today. As we know with the weakening economy it may happen in the future so you have to be ready and to look at the possible instruments or decisions you may need to take in case. So readiness, yes, but I think don't rush too quickly to conclusions but it's fair to say that the conversation has started.[end_answer] Praet: I think it's difficult to say today. When you look at prices, market prices, yes the date of the first lift-off has been pushed further by market participants, so this debate on the tiering has been coming. As I say, the perspective of rates for longer is something you have to look at, all the consequences of that.[end_answer] Praet: The negative rates have been extremely useful to support the economy basically because the opportunity costs of saving have been low. So you push people either to spend or to go into more risk and supporting the economy, going into investment and all that. We have been big effects of the negative rates on the economy, which is good also for the banks themselves because if their customers do better it's also good for them. The question that comes today is that with the slowing of the economy, because of international and geopolitical factors, you get lower growth, then you get also the negative effect of the rate situation on the intermediation margin. That's how the debate has been triggered. Now, on the economy you have to see how the things will evolve.[end_answer] Praet: Well, it reflects concerns because basically, our policy – our communication has not changed recently. We have this forward guidance which basically says that the rates are going to stay at the present level until through the end of the year. But the recent increase of Bund prices where the rates really fell to zero or even negative rates, reflects concerns in the market and some flight to safety. So they reflect a concern about the economy in general, yes, so it's an indication of uncertainties in the market, yes.[end_answer] Praet: I am not particularly concerned about Germany. I think balance sheets in general of NFCs – non-financial corporations – of households and of the state actually are in good shape. I think this is a country that can absorb a number of shocks. Of course on the other side the German economy is very much depending on manufacturing, as we know that manufacturing has been really hit by the international uncertainties related to protectionism and also the slowdown in China and also the UK. One has to say that in the UK there has been a visible slowdown of investments, so the investments have come to a halt. Germany of course is a big exporter of investment goods, equipment goods and Germany has been hit already today by the Brexit-related uncertainties. So yes, I think the country is resilient. On the other hand, they're exposed to manufacturing. I think they can go through but it's of course a more delicate phase in the business cycle for them.[end_answer] Praet: Italy is another case. It's a different case. Italy is weak since a long time so Italy has a number of recessions before. They had I would say three recessions. They have a new recession now. I think it's a difficult case where you need really more structural reforms of course, but that's a different sort of situation.[end_answer] Praet: Yes, well, the concerns in general are of political nature. I think the persistent character of all these uncertainties, and you listed a number of uncertainties, are weighing on economic sentiment and business sentiment in general. So you can say it's only for the persistence of these uncertainties, at some point have real effects. For a time, businesses continue their investment plans and it is business as usual but at some point it hits confidence and has real effects. That worries me indeed. It's about time that we reduced a little bit this political uncertainty[end_answer] Praet: Well, there is so much that a central bank can do. We have a mandate which is price stability so we use the instruments we think are the best suited to reach our objective but it's only limited. If you get fundamental uncertainties related for example to the trade regime and the Brexit-related problems, the central bank cannot do much about this. It also needs to be supported by other policies in general.[end_answer] Praet: Well, I think it's time that this Brexit ends and I hope in a satisfactory and orderly way. That would probably restore confidence quickly if you do it in an orderly way. It could be the other way, but these things really sends very, very negative signals for everybody to say how is it possible to have so much uncertainty lasting so long about that issue. That's one example. The other examples in the trade sphere, it would be of course very good for confidence if the trade negotiations between US, China ended in a satisfactory way. Also we have uncertainties about the trade regime Europe is having with US, so these uncertainties really dent confidence. They have an impact on confidence and that's the worry.[end_answer] Praet: Well, what we call the TLTRO, the funding for lending, is a very flexible instrument and there are many parameters in that instrument. What we have decided in the Governing Council is to disclose some of the parameters. First is the TLTRO is available; that means it's basically a funding instrument. So borrowers, banks will be able to borrow for two years up to two years. This is a funding side. It basically responds to the concerns that we have about congestion on the bond market, linked to two cliff effects; one cliff effect will be in June of next year, the other, March of the following year. That we have addressed.[end_answer] The other issue with the TLTRO is to what extent do you want to use it as an instrument to support lending conditions? That's the incentive scheme that you need to put in place. That's premature because you want to have more clarity about the evolution of the economy and the lending part that supports the economy. For the time being now we don't see anything special in terms of lending, banking intermediation to non-financial corporations or for households. Things are okay on that side. Of course the central bank pre-emptively has to look how the situation potentially will evolve and with the weakening of the economic growth you must be ready to act the instruments needed if you want to support lending. I would say in terms of pricing, for the TLTRO you want to first make an assessment; what is the pricing that corresponds the best to the problem you want to address? If it's lower lending at that time, the pricing has to take that into account. It's a bit premature now so we're going to decide in due time, as we say.[end_answer] Praet: The first allotment will be in September of this year so you have to do it before. That will be decided maybe, I don't know, but maybe I will be gone. That means for the Governing Council of June, because we also will have the projections at that time. That would be one opportunity before September, but this being said, the Governing Council can always decide to change the incentive scheme of a programme. We did it in the past, given the evolution of the economy. We can do it in the future. As I said it's a very flexible instrument so you can do that, but it must be adapted to the problem you want to address, which is a monetary policy issue that you have to have in consideration.[end_answer] Praet: Well, you see, the TLTRO-II is extremely advantageous for banks because they can borrow money at minus 40 basis points, so there is still a maturity of about one year. There is no incentive to go in a new one for a bank that could borrow at minus 40 except if you put the condition at minus 40, of course. But you see here, there is no need to rush for the banks. They maybe use it as a funding instrument but in terms of supporting lending for the time being, it's not the primary purpose; it's something we keep, we are aware of course of the slowdown of the economy, of the downside risk that we flag so that instruments can be designed and calibrated in a proper way when times come. That's a little bit what we have now, so the fact that the take-up for the September is far away, but for the September allotment it's not a major issue there because that's more a funding device. The question will be how you price it and what are the conditions of the pricing? That will depend on the assessment of the Governing Council about the lending conditions in general.[end_answer] Praet: We don't like to speak too much about the toolbox. There are many questions about the toolbox and they say, oh, what is this mysterious toolbox and all that? Once you start talking about something, you get a lot of speculative attitudes and speculation about what we do and how far you are going to go. You just say the path we always control that when we need to do something with our mandate, we find a way to do that. I think more realistically the situation which is more in probabilistic terms is an economy that will not recover in the coming quarters, because that's our scenario, and basically what you would see is an increase of credit spreads. You would see some impairment in the lending conditions, the standards would tighten. Then the appropriate instruments are for example the TLTRO and how the central bank can influence lending conditions. That's how the tiering discussions came back to see if at some point the conditions evolved in such a way that you see some impairments in the lending part or on the corporate bond markets. Then the central bank may wish to use some of these instruments. That's the context. Speculating about the big crisis, I think that's something I don't want to do.[end_answer] Praet: Well, we say that all instruments are available, even new instruments are available; QE is of course available as we say, but I think it's needless. All the instruments are available as we said, even new instruments are possible, but I think it's not a time to speculate about this.[end_answer] Praet: I don't have a worst day at the ECB, really. I thought about these things, now that I'm reaching the end. I had difficult days, that yes, sometimes because of the sovereign debt crisis. I would say a worst day, you know what helps very much in difficult circumstances, and I must not complain; it's basically when you work in a group, in a team and it makes a whole difference. I had it all my life; also in the banking crisis in Belgium, it was sometimes extremely stressful. When you are in a team it changes totally the situation at least for me. I cannot speak about the worst day.[end_answer] If you really push me, the thing about the worst day, I would immediately say when there was less unity. You see, these are the situations where the stress goes up; because you feel that the team is disunited. Well, I don't see that really as a worst day because the team was in general, the team – that means the Governing Council – was very strong even for those having different opinions. There was a sense of unity in general in the Council, believe it or not, but that's how I feel.[end_answer] Praet: No, I have nothing to say on this. It was a fantastic cooperation with Mario, but that's for the others, that's for the politicians to decide.",[],[],1949,M,Belgium,2011 - 2019,[],[],0,0,12046,[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
313,2019-01-09,Interview with Latvian TV,Luis de Guindos,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2019/html/ecb.in190109.en.html,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Toms Pastors on 7 January and broadcast on 9 January for Latvian TV1 “Pasaules Panorama (World Panorama”)","The euro as a currency has just entered the age of young adult, if you will. There have been some growing pains especially during the sovereign debt crisis. How would you rate the role we have taken thus far? Did we barely survive these 20 years, or are we in a good position at the moment?[end_question] There was a time when we were actively speaking about the possibility that we might lose one member state and this last year Greece finished the whole programme. Do you feel that at the moment the mechanisms are there to avoid a situation like this; that crisis in one country could lead to a really large problem for the whole euro zone?[end_question] One of the gaps, if you look at the euro zone as a whole and the member states of the EU, you can see that even countries that are really financially stable are still refusing to do what they signed up to do – to introduce the euro, like in Sweden or Poland. Twenty years is a long time. Why haven't any steps been taken towards introducing the euro in these countries?[end_question] Do you have any timetables in mind?[end_question] As you mentioned, this is the time when the UK is leaving the European Union and many are unhappy, including many Brits themselves. But there is also this talk that without the UK, Europe could further develop towards closer integration, towards fiscal union, banking union and so on. Do you feel that this is also a possibility for the rest of the EU to go towards deeper integration?[end_question] Given the current political climate in Europe, do you feel that moving towards closer integration is the right step because we see a lot of backlash at this moment both in nationalistic, populist and so on?[end_question] If we take one case in particular – that of Italy – we see that there is this new government that is really pointing the finger against these technocratic institutions, including the ECB, and saying this is not the future, we cannot go on like this. They're the third largest euro zone member, so third most important. So what can you answer to that kind of political sentiment that indeed is rising?[end_question] How do you see this integration in the next five or ten years? Do you have some idea? For example, you mentioned a new member state - if the convergence criteria are fulfilled - regarding Bulgaria. Other things? What are you looking for?[end_question] Given the different approaches that the member states are having, do you feel that a two speed, a multi-speed Europe is a risk, a possibility, an inevitability?","Well, it's obvious that we've had difficulties but if you look backwards, I think that you can realise that the euro has been a very important success. Undoubtedly the euro is the most important element of European integration. It's not only economics or financial issues; it's that this is the real instrument in terms of cooperation. Despite the difficulties, because undoubtedly we had the debt crisis, as you have said, today the euro has delivered financial and economic stability to the euro zone. It is the second most important world currency now in terms of reserves. And we have an inflation rate that's below 2 %, -but close to 2%. Even if you look at the measures we have taken in the last five years, monetary policy has been one of the main drivers of the recovery that we have now in Europe. So, all in all, despite the difficulties and although we still need reforms to be taken in the near future, I think that we can conclude that the euro, the single currency has been a real success.[end_answer] I think there is something about the euro that is quite relevant. The euro is a project that you can join in but that is much more difficult to leave. In that regard, I would say that we come from the difficulties over the last ten years making reforms. We created the ESM, we set up the banking union, so we have been acquiring additional instruments to overcome the difficulties. I think that we are much more prepared to face a new crisis despite the fact that there are gaps; gaps that we have to fill.[end_answer] Well, I think that you know some countries have joined the euro. Latvia is a very good example. Now you are celebrating your fifth anniversary of joining the euro. The euro is the currency of the European Union, so in that regard I think that is a question of time. I am totally sure that besides the United Kingdom, that unfortunately is leaving the Union, and besides Denmark the rest of the countries will eventually join the euro. I think that in order to do that, we have to complete the financial and institutional architecture of the euro zone.[end_answer] No, it's very difficult to put forward a timetable in that area, but I'm fully convinced that as the euro makes progress and time goes by more and more countries will join the euro zone – we have the case of Bulgaria now. And I suppose other countries will rapidly start to apply to join the euro. If you look at the polls – the polls are very clear – 75% of the population of the euro zone is in favour of the single currency. So we cannot be complacent but I think, and this is quite relevant in the times that we are living now, the euro is the main instrument that we have in terms of political integration, in terms of financial integration and there is a lot of political will behind the single currency, so what I would expect is that more and more countries will eventually join the euro zone.[end_answer] Well, the first thing that I have to say is that Brexit is something that is detrimental especially to the UK, but also for the rest of the Union. These are the decisions made by the British population, we have nothing to say in that regard. But I think that it’s going to be quite negative in terms of economic performance for the UK. The rest of the members of the Union will have to continue cooperating and continue integrating our economies. I think that in that aspect further integration is the correct answer. I repeat again, it’s quite unfortunate that the UK, such a big economy, leaves the Union, but this decision is taken by the British people. We regret that decision. I would like to express that we have to continue cooperating with the UK and that I hope that we will have a divorce that will be orderly and that will let us continue operating with the UK. But now the decision has to be taken by the British parliament, so full respect for the decisions taken by the British population and by the British parliament. But I think that we will have to continue our integration process in the euro area.[end_answer] Undoubtedly we have seen more populism all over Europe in recent years, but I think that the correct response is to take further steps in terms of integration. There is not an easy fix to the problems of Europe. But I think that the euro indicates that there is a way forward and that we can overcome difficulties together and that the very nationalistic and domestic approaches are not enough in order to do that, but that it’s much better to do it together. And in that regard the euro is the main element of coherence and the main element of political integration and financial integration that we have in the EU.[end_answer] I do not want to comment on any particular country, but even if you look at Italy, if you look at the polls, there is a very important majority of the Italian people who support the euro. We have seen that the Italian government – and I think that is something that is quite positive – has switched to an agreement with the European Commission on the draft budgetary plan of Italy. We have seen that since this agreement has been reached, the financial tensions in Italy have started to ease. I think that this is an indication that there is a way forward. My impression is that we have to explain very clearly to the European people that there is not an easy fix, that there are no magic solutions for complicated problems, but that the only way forward is to continue with the process of further integration at the European level, and that this is going to be the best solution and the best alternative in terms of the well-being, the lives of the European people.[end_answer] I think that we cannot be complacent. If you look backwards with respect to the evolution of the European economy you realise that monetary policy has been the main driver of the recovery. We are entering into the fourth consecutive year of recovery in Europe. More than nine million jobs have been created within Europe. I think that monetary policy has been the main driver of this recovery. But there are other steps that we have to complete. For instance we started the project of the banking union; that is something that is quite relevant, we have a level playing field for all the banks in the euro zone. We created the SSM, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, also the Single Resolution Board. But there is a third part that has not been completed, there is a third pillar, the common deposit guarantee scheme. I normally say that a banking union is like a table. A table needs three legs in order to be stable. We have two – supervision and resolution – but we need a third one that is quite relevant, a common deposit insurance scheme, what we call EDIS in our jargon. So this is something where we have to take steps in order to make further progress.[end_answer] And there is another very important project, the capital markets union. In order to do that we need to harmonise the different regulations among different countries, something that is not easy, something that has been put forward by Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis. But I think that is going to be key. Finally, well, we will have the discussion about a fiscal instrument in order to confront potential asymmetric shocks in the euro zone. From a political standpoint the last European Council decided that we should start with this fiscal facility. I think that is a first step. Normally long trips start with the first step. We have taken the first step in order to have this fiscal facility. I'm thinking that is something that should complement monetary policy in order to have all these instruments to confront shocks, to confront a crisis, because a crisis will arrive for sure.[end_answer] I do not see it now. I think that we should work in parallel. I hope that we should create the political will in every country in order to work together and to advance and make progress together. I believe that a single speed is much better than a multi-speed euro zone or European Union.","[""inflation rate that's below""]","[""And we have an inflation rate that's below 2 %, -but close to 2%""]",1960,M,Spain,2018 -,['and we have an inflation rate that be below but close to '],['and we have an inflation rate that be below but close to '],1,1,8022,[],0,"[""And we have an inflation rate that's below 2 but close to 2.""]",1,1,['and we have an inflation rate thats below 2 but close to 2'],['orientation'],[True],[],[],0,['orientation'],1,1,['and we have an inflation rate thats below 2 but close to 2'],['orientation'],['and we have an inflation rate thats below 2 but close to 2'],['orientation'],['and we have an inflation rate thats below 2 but close to 2'],['orientation'],['orientation'],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True],[True]
316,2020-12-02,Transcript of the fireside chat at Reuters Global Outlook Investment Summit,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in201202~d24616dd00.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2020","The pandemic has of course dominated your year but after nine difficult months, might we be turning a corner? An effective vaccine puts the end of the pandemic in sight. But it’s going to take some time to deploy this vaccine, so 2021 is still going to be difficult. From your perspective, what’s the biggest challenge, the biggest risk in 2021?[end_question] If you translate that to monetary policy and your particular task in this, what does the ECB have to do in this period?[end_question] Even before the pandemic there was a tendency for deglobalisation, mostly on the back of trade tensions. Do you reckon this is temporary? Can there be a return to the sort of globalisation we saw in the past two to three decades?[end_question] Do you see a risk that there would be an actual reversal in globalisation or merely just a slowdown?[end_question] From start to finish, the pandemic will have disrupted life for a year and a half and it’s quite difficult for an economy to survive so long without some form of permanent damage or scarring. Where in the economy do you expect permanent damage and how do we overcome this?[end_question] We struggled with structural problems even before the pandemic. Europe had low growth, low inflation, weak productivity growth. Is the pandemic going to amplify these already existing structural problems and what is the long-term implication of this amplification for monetary policy?[end_question] You of course mentioned the Next Generation EU fund, but that is now held up over political concerns. Do you see a risk that it will not happen or that it will be significantly delayed?[end_question] Just a few moments ago you hinted that perhaps the ECB’s job is not to lower borrowing costs further but to maintain them at their current levels, and of course President Lagarde and Isabel Schnabel made similar comments. Are we interpreting your words correctly that your aim is not to lower borrowing costs any further but ensure they persist longer?[end_question] Next week you will of course recalibrate your policies and you made it clear the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and bank liquidity facilities will be the main instruments of your choice. But the ECB tends to work in packages, so should we expect you to touch other instruments as well or should we expect these two instruments to be the package?[end_question] One of these policies was to create a temporary purchase envelope of the asset purchase programme (APP), which was €120 billion but this is of course almost exhausted now. In retrospect, do you see the value in having such an envelope and, going forward, do you think you will still need an envelope for the APP?[end_question] Isabel Schnabel, who is also an ECB Board member, last week made an argument for the case of returning inflation back to target somewhat more slowly. I don’t want to pit you against Ms Schnabel but in a speech just a few days later you made a very different argument about not being complacent, no delay in increasing inflation. These two statements seem to be contradictory but of course you might just explain they’re not. I’m curious how you reconcile these two views.[end_question] The question is, of course, timing. I’m curious, the first step in your two-step approach, what is the timeframe for that?[end_question] Inflation figures out this week showed a negative reading for the fourth month running, and already in the accounts you warned that negative inflation may persist for longer than you feared earlier. Given the information from this reading and over the last six weeks, are you becoming more pessimistic regarding the inflation path?[end_question] You briefly discussed the strategy review just before. One of the questions about this strategy is what’s going to be the new inflation target. The Fed of course moved to average inflation targeting last August, and some members of the ECB’s Governing Council are also advocating either average targeting or some sort of make-up strategy. The IMF also said this is something the ECB should be looking at. What’s your view about a make-up strategy?[end_question] The review is scheduled to last until mid-2021 but there is some talk that the inflation target itself could be agreed upon earlier. When do you think the ECB could communicate the new target?[end_question] Still, should we expect the target to be taken out and communicated earlier? Or do you think it should be one package at the end?[end_question] The Wall Street Journal this week reported that after some policy meetings over the last year you held private conversations with investment banks and economists to explain policy decisions. In retrospect, do you think these conversations, which were one-on-one conversations, if I understand correctly, were appropriate and do you plan to continue having such discussions[end_question] Have you scheduled such calls for next Friday?[end_question] During this pandemic, much of the economy is sustained by governments and they are taking on a lot more debt. However, in a world of persistently low interest rates, perhaps our understanding of debt should be recalibrated. The Maastricht criteria appear to be outdated. Do you think that in a world of low interest rates, low natural rates, we should think about debt differently than 10 or 20 years ago?[end_question] Your debt purchases provided a sort of crutch for governments, who are spending through the pandemic. You are providing a similar type of crutch to the banking sector through your TLTROs – ultra-cheap refinancing operations. However, unlike in the case of the asset purchases, you haven’t made a commitment to keep these going for an extended period of time. Do you think that you will need to do something similar for banks? Is there a need to provide greater guidance on TLTROs or make this facility more permanent?[end_question] Disclaimer","2 December 2020[end_answer] As you indicate, what we have right now is a mixed story, which is the very good news that we have a credible route towards vaccination. That was, by the way, always the assumption in our baseline forecast, that there would be a medical solution rolled out in 2021. So, from our point of view, the fact that it looks like the vaccines are on their way confirms our baseline scenario and makes it less likely that we will have more severe scenarios. So, that’s very good news. But of course, the trick is we’re in the middle of the second wave. Of course, there is already some progress in containing the second wave. But the reality is – as I think all of the public health experts you will see on TV will tell you -- it’s going to be a mixed reality. We cannot live unrestricted lives until there is mass vaccination and, to me, the biggest challenge is making that adjustment: to realise and to benefit later in 2021 from as widespread vaccination as possible but, in the meantime, to reconcile the need to control the virus with the importance of supporting the economy.[end_answer] I think we’ve been clear and our most recent policy statement in October was extremely clear and really captures it: our role is to ensure favourable financing conditions. Right now, you can look at different measures. You can look at what’s happening in terms of risk-free rates, the sovereign bond market, the terms and conditions that banks charge their customers, which is a very important indicator in a bank-based system. So, if we can keep financing conditions where they are these days, at a low level, that supports the economic recovery and offsetting the pandemic shock to inflation. And in that world – we know and we’ve been saying that –,for example, fiscal policy can be very powerful. In a world with low interest rates, the multiplier effect of fiscal policy can be quite high, compared with normal conditions.[end_answer] I think it’s very important to differentiate between the policy decisions, so free trade, the attitudes of multinational firms and so on, and the technological issues to do with globalisation. What I think we have in fact been seeing in the last five or ten years is a plateau. After a period with the opening up of the former Soviet Union, the opening up of China and so on, the reduction in shipping costs, the digitisation, there was a big increase in global activity. You would need something that is driving down trade costs to see a resurrection of that. The fact that we have a high level of globalisation is relevant but let’s see what happens with the economics of trade costs and the economics of the differentials. So, in a world where, for example, wage differentials between the advanced economies and the emerging economies would narrow, then the economic case for a lot of offshoring, of chopping up the value chain, is less. And then in a world of geographic risk, climate change and so on, building redundancy into supply chains makes sense, which would mean more regional supply chains, not just global supply chains.[end_answer] I think that the economics of that is open. You can imagine a world where there are reasons why trade costs go up or the fundamental drivers of trade including, as I indicated to you, relative labour costs narrow, which we could see in a kind of market-driven way less by way of global trade. We also know that as countries get richer, the balance of spending moves from goods consumption to services consumption, which tends to be local. I’m not really a crystal ball gazer, I don’t need to make strong bets about the future of globalisation, but we do need to be open-minded. I do think, coming back to the basic point here, the force of hyperglobalisation – which surely contributed to anti-inflation pressures – is probably going to be weaker. That I do agree with.[end_answer] There will be problems to face but, of course, these would have been much more severe without the fiscal policy and monetary policy reaction, which has already been exceptional. Let me point to three areas. One is those sectors that were hit hardest. So, the travel industry, tourism; and then I think, looking ahead, now that we’ve got used to working from home more, also this issue about the future of offices. I’m sure it’s not going to return to where it was. I’m also equally sure the current working from home will not continue in the same way. So, I think there will be big challenges for certain industries.[end_answer] On the macro level, if you think about employment, workers can move across industries but the experience of so many workers, the fact that so many people have worked less this year, in terms of accumulation of their skills, their experience, the loss of their income, there’s a negative from that.[end_answer] The last one is that so many firms have lost revenues this year. We know that, with weaker balance sheets, their investment plans for the coming years will be less. Their retained earnings have been depleted. So, there will be scarring effects through those channels.[end_answer] One difference though, of course, with a pandemic, is that once the pandemic is over, it’s not the case that the tourism industry has permanently lost its desirability. Many people, in fact, will be very much wanting to return to normal holidaymaking, going to restaurants as normal and so on, once it’s fully safe to do so.[end_answer] I’ll give a nuanced answer to that. There’s no doubt that the fight against the pandemic is using up a lot of resources. Those resources, in a different world, could have been directly applied to boosting investment, boosting digitalisation and fighting climate change. In that sense, the pandemic is absolutely a cost which has made it more difficult to make progress on other fronts. On the other hand, we have seen very important structural change this year. In the European context, the fact that we have the Next Generation EU fund agreed in terms of the plan, the focus on that for the next few years, supporting public investment in digitalisation and the green transition. That is an important support for post-pandemic recovery, post-pandemic structural transformation. So, I do think indirectly there have been some innovations this year, which will be helpful after the pandemic.[end_answer] It’s not particularly my job to make political calculations. All we can say is that it’s very important that it gets implemented, that it creates a very strong bedrock of vision for the European economy for the coming years. So, it’s very important that this negotiation concludes with the plan agreed.[end_answer] Let me emphasise the near and medium-term perspectives on that. I’m going to remind you that, in our forward guidance, we do say that we are prepared to lower interest rates, if necessary, to support the convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim. So, in making these comments we are in no way suggesting that we are at the lower bound of our interest rate policy. But what we are emphasising, behind all of these comments, it’s a little bit like forward guidance. We know that the yield curve has drifted down to a low level. The forward guidance says look, you can not only think about ‘if I were to borrow today, what do I see?’. But it is a signal from the central bank that, in terms of the coming period, during this pandemic, we’re going to ensure favourable financing conditions. It provides a lot of reassurance. It reduces the risk of a sudden tightening of financing conditions, it should boost confidence, through that channel, in the same way as forward guidance does via interest rate policy. It’s not just interest rates today but we reassure you that interest rates are not going to rise until there is more pressure on inflation. So in that sense, it’s to provide the forward guidance, to provide the confidence in this world of uncertainty that it’s not the case – you are a firm or a household thinking about borrowing money – that you are going to face any kind of sudden reversal in financing conditions.[end_answer] From a policymaking point of view, we’re still nine days away. So it’s way too early to reach conclusions on that because, of course, the world evolves every day. But let me remind you, if you look at some of my speeches and others: we have done a lot of policies this year. Of course, the headline, the big ones are the PEPP and the revision of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) programme. But there is a wide array of policies in respect of collateral, in respect of swaps and repos and so on. So, I think it’s important not to infer that we are only looking at two programmes. But what is true is that these two programmes have been very effective ways to respond to the pandemic. It doesn’t rule out any other marginal policy but it does say: look, if these policies have proven to be an effective way to respond to the pandemic, then of course we have to look closely at them in the context of next week’s meeting.[end_answer] This extra APP envelope came in before the PEPP was invented, almost six days earlier. So of course, at many levels, at the margin, in terms of asset purchasing under these pandemic conditions, now that we have the PEPP, you might think that should be the dominant asset purchasing. But it doesn’t rule it out. We always have to take a look at the APP, if is there a value to looking at the APP margin. So, I wouldn’t want to convey any signal about that. But in terms of the design of the PEPP compared with the APP, the flexibility of the PEPP, we think is a very good match for these pandemic conditions.[end_answer] Let me offer one basic reconciliation. Isabel Schnabel, in the opening of that speech, made it clear that her speech was in the context of the strategy review. It was not a preview of the December monetary policy meeting, at least that’s my understanding. So these discussions about financial stability, the optimal speed to close the inflation gap, and so on, are all absolutely part of our strategy review and part of the global conversation about how you balance these different considerations as part of a monetary policy framework. She made clear that these are all big issues for our strategy review.[end_answer] More narrowly, in terms of the current conjuncture, what I’ve emphasised is essentially a two-step approach. So again, it’s not the case that we’re projecting we’re going to hit our inflation aim in the near term. The near-term [goal] is to undo the damage the pandemic has done to the inflation path. So that’s not going to deliver us the inflation aim over our projection horizon. But it’s important to break into steps the overall objective of getting inflation towards close to, but below, 2%. In terms of what we’re doing now, it’s useful to have to focus on saying look, let’s see if we can undo the damage of the pandemic, restore inflation to the trajectory it was on and then, of course, over time, it will be a sustained effort, as it has been since at least 2015, which goes back to the fact that we know it’s important to recognise that we’re going to move towards the inflation aim in a gradual way. But it’s very important that the momentum is there. It’s very difficult to live with a reversal of that momentum, to see inflation dropping. Right now, in the middle of a pandemic, we understand why inflation is so low. But it’s important that this doesn’t get locked in. It’s important that we restore momentum to the inflation path, in order to get us back on that trajectory which, over time and in a gradual way, will bring us to the inflation aim.[end_answer] It remains an intrinsic element of our medium-term orientation that this does not correlate with a fixed calendar. It does depend on what shocks hit the European economy, on what other policies are in place, and so on. I think it’s a mistake to orientate to any one fixed calendar, however frustrating that might be for somebody who is trying to think about that. What I always say is that it’s important that we see the momentum, it’s important that we see inflation move in the right direction. Of course that cannot be immediate; we’re not trying to say that inflation in the first quarter of 2021 will respond to our current policies. But, over the time horizon of monetary policy, we have to see an improvement in the inflation path.[end_answer] No, not especially, because we understand it. Part of it is the German indirect tax cut, which will be reversed. Part of it is, for example, categories which will be most heavily hit by the pandemic, such as tourism, airfares, hotel costs, all of those. Those have taken a big hit. But once the economy recovers then the very low prices in those sectors, which have been the case this autumn, will reverse to some extent. So it’s not so much the reversal of the very low inflation now, it’s going from the 1% tight range, once those are reversed, to bring inflation momentum up from 1 to the mid 1s towards 2. That’s going to be the big challenge.[end_answer] Time is too short to get into this too much. As we’ve said, no stone is going to be left unturned in this strategy review. All of those issues are definitely part of the strategy review. But let me drill into the key issue. The key issue is: how do you maintain expected inflation at your targeted level when the reality is that you’re going to spend a lot of time away from the target? The different types of make-up strategies are designed in order to support expectations remaining anchored at the target. I think that’s why there’s so much interest in make-up strategies. But also, it’s a matter of logic that there could be a very wide family of different strategies, which basically have the same intent, which is to make sure that medium-term expected inflation remains at the target, even when there are negative shocks. The policies to make all of that consistent, in terms of how you respond when you’re close to the lower bound, how you respond if inflation is temporarily just above the target, all of that needs to be worked through. But this is very much a global conversation. The academic world, the community of central bank economists, everyone is looking at that. But, of course, the precise expression of what is needed in terms of policy to support that could well vary across central banks.[end_answer] Right now we’re super busy. We heard this phrase in the Brexit talks about the tunnel. You go into the tunnel and you don’t come out. We’re in the tunnel. Right now the focus has to be on our internal discussions, because whenever we communicate it has to be in a very constructive and structured way. I think that’s down the road. The focus right now has to be on the content of the review itself and we need the time and the space as indicated by that timeline you have. It is going to be the second half of 2021 before we conclude. It’s important we have that time and space to fully consider our new strategy.[end_answer] We’re not at the point of discussing that kind of issue. It’s in a very much earlier phase than that.[end_answer] It’s very important whenever policy officials such as myself interact with market participants that it’s done in a very systemic, structured, planned, transparent way. So, in this communication policy, I would have these calls with individual ECB watcher groups – that’s essentially the community. And it’s not one on one, of course, because our rules say it’s important that I am accompanied by staff members in those conversations for transparency and note-taking. This is a long-standing issue of how policy officials should interact with the market. One of the core principles is not to be engaged before we make a policy decision. That’s why we have a blackout period. Once we have made a policy decision, and by the way, the days, especially the quarterly meetings when we have the new projection, even after the press conference we publish the new projections. So it’s in order to see if the information, the new public information that’s come out that day, to see if there are any questions, to hear their feedback. It very much conforms with the key principles of how to interact with the market in relation to already published information. It’s not to front-run future decisions. So, the timing, I think we thought a lot about it. It’s a structured, systematic approach where we rotate across different types of ECB watchers. It’s transparent, it’s in my diary. It’s also true that we should always review and keep in mind our communication policy. It was a deliberate and structured approach in doing so, I think it’s part of a good communication policy. But, of course, we keep that always under review.[end_answer] It’s important, our standing approach right now is to continue those calls. So, the concept of doing it, yes, but the practice is to schedule these calls in the afternoon, in between the press release at 13:45 and the press conference, to schedule calls for later the day.[end_answer] There’s a range of different elements to what you say. There is the European fiscal framework, which is under review. With so many countries away from the 60% debt limit under Maastricht, it’s important that this practical issue is considered in the context of the fiscal framework. Let me emphasise two points. One is that this pandemic has shown the value of having fiscal space. The ability to have a big surge in public debt in a short period of time is more possible if your public debt level returns to a lower level outside the emergency situation. That is an important message. If you want to be able to have a forceful fiscal response, because who knows about future tail shocks like this one, it’s important to recognise that having a bit of spare capacity in fiscal policy is important. That will indicate that it’s important post-pandemic to find a strategy to bring down the debt level.[end_answer] On the other hand, it’s inescapable that there’s a degree of uncertainty about the real rate, but there are many forces which say that the real rate is structurally lower now than 15 years ago or 30 years ago. Back then, that safe level of public debt could be different.[end_answer] My third point, which I try to make all the time, is that you have to interpret public debt in the context of the wider economy. This is unlike some classic cycles in the past, where the public debt was the mirror image of a large external debt. By and large, what’s happening now is that there’s no European country running large current account deficits. The macroeconomic effect of high public debt is very different when it’s balanced by high household savings, most directly, compared with accumulating net external debt to foreign investors. So the macroeconomics of debt sustainability is quite different in the situation we have now compared with some of those historical, classic vulnerability cases.[end_answer] Everything we’re doing right now is about the pandemic period. It wouldn’t make sense for it to be permanent, in the sense that it’s truly always there, at least in terms of the conditions we have now, which are very supportive of bank lending.[end_answer] But this goes back to the phrasing we used in the October statement, which is we are here to ensure and to preserve the currently favourable financing conditions. Very importantly, that includes the financing conditions that confront small firms that confront households, i.e. the conditions they have available from banks. The bank credit channel is very important in terms of overall financing conditions. Of course, in terms of thinking about recalibration, that discussion will also be about recalibrating the TLTROs as appropriate.","['shock to inflation', 'convergence of inflation', 'pressure on

318,2020-11-30,The future of money – innovating while retaining trust,Christine Lagarde,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in201130~ce64cb35a3.en.html,"Article by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, inL’ENA hors les mursmagazine","Important lessons can be drawn from the past to understand the factors influencing the journey towards the future of money, including the possible introduction of a digital euro. Ensuring the euro meets the needs of European citizens is at the core of the ECB’s mandate.[end_question] Role of the public sector[end_question] Technological progress[end_question] Digital euro[end_question] Crypto-assets pose risks[end_question] “Money is memory”[end_question] Disclaimer","Paris, 30 November 2020[end_answer] Throughout history, the nature of money has evolved in response to socioeconomic changes. But the functions of money – as a means of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value – have remained the same for centuries.[end_answer] One reason why money first emerged was to overcome the limitations and inefficiencies of bartering. As economies became more specialised, trade became all the more essential, and a universal medium of exchange was needed to facilitate it. Coins made from (precious) metals fulfilled that purpose for centuries.[end_answer] But with the development of international trade, coins became increasingly impractical because they are difficult to store and transport in large volumes.[end_answer] This led to the next phase in the evolution of money through medieval times into the late middle ages and early modern times. Developments included the advent of Templar’s credit notes in France, private giro banking in Italy, bills of exchange and promissory notes, and the first predecessors of paper money.[end_answer] All of these instruments foresaw convertibility into precious metal coins. The acceptance of these forms of dematerialised and easy-to-carry money depended on the reputation of the issuer, and credit risk became relevant.[end_answer] This led to the public sector playing an increasingly important role in issuing money and ensuring its value remained stable. Examples include the emergence of early public giro banks at the beginning of the 15th century and the first attempts to issue modern banknotes in the second half of the 17th century.[1][end_answer] In today’s modern economies, including in the euro area, money is no longer convertible into, or backed by, any commodity. Fiat money, as it is known, serves as legal tender by decree of the government or even constitutional legislation (such as the EU Treaty[2]). The value of money is based on citizens’ trust in it being generally accepted for all forms of economic exchange and in the ability of central banks to maintain its purchasing power through monetary policy. Central banks’ institutional independence also bolsters their ability to maintain trust in money.[end_answer] Since early modern times central banks have gradually been assuming an increasingly pivotal role in ensuring that money delivers on the three functions I outlined. They must be fully aware of and adapt to changing realities.[end_answer] As we enter the digital age, the nature of money, but also of goods and services, is changing quickly. Digitalisation and technological advances are transforming all areas of society, accelerating the process of dematerialisation.[end_answer] Non-cash payments continue to increase. In the euro area, over the last year the total number increased by 8.1% to 98 billion. Nearly half of these transactions were made by card, followed by credit transfers and direct debits.[3][end_answer] The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated this trend towards digitalisation, with a surge in online payments and a shift towards contactless payments in shops.[4]Market participants expect payments to be the financial service that will be most affected by technological innovation and competition over the next five years, according to a survey conducted in 2019.[5][end_answer] To meet the demand for digital means of payment, new forms of private money (i.e. a liability of private entities) have emerged. They are available as commercial bank deposits which can be used for transfers and direct debits, and as electronic money through credit cards and mobile payment apps.[end_answer] In the euro area, the Eurosystem’s supervision mechanisms ensure commercial banks and payment service providers are effective and safe. This enables people to continue to have confidence in private money, which remains an integral part of our financial system.[end_answer] But central bank money in digital form is still not available for retail payments.[end_answer] The ECB wants to ensure the euro remains fit for the digital era. Early this year, the Governing Council decided to explore the possibility of issuing of a digital euro – digital central bank money for retail payments, in other words.[end_answer] The Eurosystem is assessing the implications of the potential introduction of a digital euro, which in legal terms would be a liability of the central bank. In October the ECB published the Report on a digital euro[6]and launched a public consultation[7].[end_answer] But why issue a digital euro, if other forms of (private) digital money are already available?[end_answer] Central bank money is unique. It provides people with unrestricted access to a simple, essentially risk-free and trusted means of payment they can use for any basic transaction. But for retail use it is currently only offered physically in the form of cash.[end_answer] A digital euro would complement cash and ensure that consumers continue to have unrestricted access to central bank money in a form that meets their evolving digital payment needs.[end_answer] It could be important in a range of future scenarios, from a decline in the use of cash to pre-empting the uptake of foreign digital currencies in the euro area. Issuing a digital euro might become necessary to ensure both continued access to central bank money and monetary sovereignty.[end_answer] A properly designed digital euro would create synergies with the payments industry and enable the private sector to build new businesses based on digital euro-related services.[end_answer] A digital euro would also be an emblem of the ongoing process of European integration and ultimately help to unify Europe’s digital economies.[end_answer] But what about bitcoin or other crypto-assets that have been trying to gain a foothold in the digital payments space and to anchor trust in their technology?[end_answer] Innovations like distributed ledger technology (DLT), in particular blockchain (which is at the core of crypto-assets such as bitcoin), bring both new opportunities and new risks.[end_answer] Transactions between peers occur directly, with no need for a trusted third-party intermediary. The trust that is usually inherent in a transaction is replaced by cryptographic proofs and the security and integrity of records is ensured by DLT, which avoids the “double-spending” problem. Nevertheless, trust is not entirely dispensable.[end_answer] The main risk lies in relying purely on technology and the flawed concept of there being no identifiable issuer or claim. This also means that users cannot rely on crypto-assets maintaining a stable value: they are highly volatile, illiquid and speculative, and so do not fulfil all the functions of money.[8][end_answer] Recently, we have seen the emergence of stablecoins, which try to solve crypto-assets’ problem of a lack of stability and trust by pegging their assets to stable and trusted fiat money issued by States.[9]And the issuers of “global” stablecoins, which target a global footprint, further aim to introduce their own payment schemes and clearing and settlement arrangements.[10][end_answer] Although stablecoins could drive additional innovation in payments and be well integrated into social media, trade and other platforms, they pose serious risks.[end_answer] If widely adopted, they could threaten financial stability and monetary sovereignty. For instance, if the issuer cannot guarantee a fixed value or if they are perceived as being incapable of absorbing losses, a run could occur. Additionally, using stablecoins as a store of value could trigger a large shift of bank deposits to stablecoins, which may have an impact on banks’ operations and the transmission of monetary policy.[11][end_answer] Stablecoins, particularly those backed by global technology firms (the “big techs”), could also present risks to competitiveness and technological autonomy in Europe, as they would attempt to leverage their competitive advantage and control of large platforms. Their dominant positions may harm competition and consumer choice, and raise concerns over data privacy and the misuse of personal information.[12][end_answer] In general, end users prioritise ease of use and smooth integration with other apps or services, and therefore welcome new solutions in exchange for providing their personal data. Public authorities are open to innovation and are prepared to act as catalysts for change, while implementing appropriate policy measures to ensure this innovation helps consumers rather than hindering them.[end_answer] Payment providers and their payment solutions must be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight – in accordance with the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules” – to protect users and safeguard the stability of the economy against new risks that even go beyond financial ones.[end_answer] Some say that “money is memory”[13], and it seems that this memory is becoming increasingly digital. But consumers’ digital data and records must not be misused. The abuse of personal information for commercial or other purposes could endanger privacy and harm competition. These and other potential risks are being assessed by the Eurosystem and European institutions.[end_answer] At the same time, public authorities must balance the benefits and risks of innovation in payments and be prepared to take a leading role in ensuring that payments remain efficient, safe and inclusive in the digital age.[end_answer] As the economy continues to evolve and new expectations about the nature of money emerge, the Eurosystem must be ready to respond and ensure that European payments adapt to changing consumer preferences and remain inclusive and efficient.[end_answer] Despite all the changes I have mentioned, the foundations of money remain intact. People accept money only if it is highly trusted, maintains its value and respects privacy – an aspect that is becoming increasingly important in the digital age. These foundations have been and will continue to be found in central bank money, irrespective of the form it takes in the future.",[],[],1956,F,France,2019 -,[],[],0,0,10149,[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

Do you think that this “revolutionary” process is now a reality in most of the major institutions, businesses and governments?[end_question] Is the process starting to produce results? As our report shows, women are finally gaining access to management positions. Are we witnessing the shattering of the glass ceiling, even though some institutions are still lagging significantly behind in terms of gender parity (and I am not just referring to the ECB Governing Council!)?[end_question] More generally, do you think that women have become more influential, even outside the institutions, firms or countries with female leaders?[end_question] Having long worked with (predominantly) male teams, do you see a change in men’s attitudes to women accessing top jobs?[end_question] Do you find it easier and more pleasant to have women around you?[end_question] In your view, are there still cultural, ideological or religious barriers in some countries which are impeding this “revolution” to bring about gender parity at work. Isn’t it true that women have fewer rights than men in some societies?[end_question] Disclaimer","18 September 2020[end_answer] There is a certain level of awareness now, but we’re only just getting started. Gender inequality still exists in terms of access to the job market and the pay gap. In OECD countries, the gender wage gap is still 13%. Women are working more and more but are still under-represented in management positions in both the private and public sectors. The coronavirus crisis has made the situation worse for women. Women make up almost 70% of the healthcare workforce; they are at greater risk from a health perspective. During lockdown, they have been active on all fronts, forced to work while caring for their children, not to mention coping with the threat of domestic violence. As in every economic crisis, they are at greater risk of losing their jobs or of having their wages cut.[end_answer] The road towards gender parity in the workplace is anything but straight. It is a long-term process that requires vigilance at all times from every segment of society.[end_answer] We have made some progress, but unfortunately there is a civil society consensus at international level that, given the still slow pace of advancement, any significant gains on the equality front will take decades rather than years to emerge – unless something changes. Even if one particular female director, or a company or organisation helps to bring about change, we cannot focus on this one achievement at the expense of the bigger picture. There are still too few women in management worldwide, particularly in the economic and financial spheres, including central banks. The 19 euro area central banks are run exclusively by men. Of the 25 members that make up the ECB Governing Council, Isabel Schnabel ‑ a member of the Executive Board ‑ and I are the only two women in the family photo. That’s not how it should be![end_answer] I think that progress is being made within institutions, firms and countries and that people are acknowledging women’s ability to see things differently from men. We take a different approach to risk-taking, for example. You’ve often heard me say that if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters, the financial crisis of 2008 would no doubt have turned out differently. And the quality of a number of women leaders in the political or economic arena has certainly enabled better management of the unprecedented health crisis which we are now experiencing. But there are still too few women in positions of responsibility. More needs to be done in many areas. Just to give one example: we should encourage men to take paternity leave, and grant it to them for longer periods than their current entitlement of a few days or weeks.[end_answer] And beyond the professional world, too, there is still quite a way to go, as is sadly evident from the prevalence of domestic violence and number of femicides.[end_answer] Yes, men are definitely more accepting than before of women attaining the most senior positions, and corporate behaviour is beginning to change. Not only with regard to career paths, but also in day-to-day interaction between men and women. This is a valuable and necessary transformation; moreover, the younger generations are more aware of these issues. But the real change in mentality will come when nobody, male or female, questions the legitimacy of a woman holding a position of power.[end_answer] What matters in a team is the diversity of backgrounds and profiles and the complementarity of its members. Gender is a part of this necessary diversity, but it’s not the sole criterion.[end_answer] Yes, there are all kinds of barriers. Take legal barriers for a start. I suggest you read the most recent World Bank report on the subject. On average, women around the world enjoy only three-quarters of the rights afforded to men. Legal inequities are still enshrined in laws, even in certain constitutions, in matrimonial law, inheritance law, the signing of contracts and access to credit. Much progress has been made over the past 50 years – and France is well-placed in this respect – but in general, at global level, there is still a long way to go! Female emancipation boosts productivity and economic development. That is an established and documented fact.

Will a verbal intervention be enough to prevent the euro from continuing to rise?[end_question] Eurozone unemployment is increasing rapidly, core inflation reached historic lows in August, the pandemic is gathering pace. Yet the ECB is a little less gloomy about the economic outlook than three months ago. How does that fit together?[end_question] Eurozone citizens often feel that prices are climbing faster than official inflation data suggest. Do you think this misunderstanding can harm public support for ECB policies?[end_question] Do you see the ECB imitating the Fed, which listened to the public and concluded that it will now aim for an “average inflation target”?[end_question] Could some of the emergency fiscal actions by governments in response to the COVID-19 crisis increase the risk of a “zombification” of a part of the economy?[end_question] Can the public debt held by the ECB at some point undermine its independence?[end_question] What do you say to those, in France in particular, who advocate the cancellation or the perpetualisation of the public debt held by the ECB?[end_question] But when the ECB claims that it will replace the maturing public bonds with new purchases, isn’t that the same as converting them into perpetual debt?[end_question] Regarding Brexit, how concerned are you about a no deal that is likely to weigh on economic activity?[end_question] Disclaimer","16 September 2020[end_answer] We are not targeting the exchange rate. We adjust our policies according to the medium-term inflation outlook. And at the last Governing Council meeting there was still an exceptionally high level of uncertainty. As President Lagarde explained at the press conference, it was the Governing Council’s view that more information was needed on how the pandemic evolves, how our measures transmit to the real economy and how persistent exchange rate movements would ultimately prove to be. We continue monitoring incoming information carefully, including developments in the exchange rate, and we stand ready to act if the incoming data is not consistent with the objective of our emergency measures to close the inflation gap that has emerged as a result of the pandemic.[end_answer] We do not see a V-shaped economic development where we return to the pre-crisis path very quickly. Instead, we see a protracted recovery that takes time, and the same is true for the inflation outlook.[end_answer] Regarding inflation, we never base our decisions on just one month of data; we focus on how it evolves over the medium term. We see that our measures provide tangible support to core inflation, which was, however, partly offset by other factors.[end_answer] This has indeed been observed in many countries, so it must be taken seriously. This perception has mainly to do with the fact that households buy goods relatively more often for which prices have gone up more quickly – take food, for example – and they don’t really perceive that the prices of other goods, which actually have quite a bit of weight in the consumption basket, have increased by much less. I think that there is a need to communicate this better and to also work on a better understanding of what the inflation rate actually measures.[end_answer] In our monetary policy strategy review, which has just been resumed, we will also listen carefully to the different stakeholders. As far as the monetary policy strategy is concerned, the euro area differs from the United States in several important aspects, starting with the mandate. We also have a different economic structure and our financial system is much more bank-based. We will review our strategy with an open mind but it could well be that we do not end up with the same strategy as the Fed.[end_answer] We are still in the middle of the pandemic – this requires a lot of support from the fiscal, as well as from the monetary side. This has helped viable firms to survive. It would be dangerous to end the fiscal support prematurely. This mistake was made before and I don’t think we should repeat that.[end_answer] But we’re all aware that the crisis will bring structural change. In addition, we are facing secular challenges, such as the green and the digital transition, which will require support by fiscal policy. Therefore, it would be a mistake to try to preserve the pre-pandemic economic structure. Instead, we have to make sure that the crisis measures support the transition to a sustainable growth path.[end_answer] Even after years of asset purchases, the ECB is holding a relatively small share of outstanding government debt on its balance sheet. The bond free float, i.e. the share of bonds that is held outside of the Eurosystem, amounts to close to 80% when taking into account the maturity structure of outstanding government debt.[end_answer] The simple answer is that it is prohibited by the Treaty, because this would clearly constitute monetary financing. We are guided by our price stability mandate and we are not allowed to finance governments.[end_answer] No, because these reinvestments are limited to a specific time period or are contingent on a sustained return of inflation to our aim, implying that purchases are not unlimited.[end_answer] A no-deal Brexit would be harmful for everybody, especially for the United Kingdom, but also for the euro area. I would encourage the negotiating parties to work hard on avoiding that outcome. In any case it’s important that financial institutions and other market participants are prepared in the event of a no-deal scenario.","['inflation gap', 'return of inflation']","['We continue

345,2020-07-23,Interview with The Washington Post,Christine Lagarde,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in200723~0606f514ed.en.html,"Video interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted live by David Ignatius on 22 July 2020","I'm David Ignatius, a columnist for The Washington Post. It's my great pleasure to have this morning on our Washington Post Live series of programs about the Path Forward, Madam Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, before that for eight years the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, one of the people who will be guiding our global economy out of this post-COVID pandemic world. Welcome, Madam Lagarde. It's so good to have you with us on the program.[end_question] So, we're lucky to have you this morning, the day after the announcement of the EU's recovery package of €750 billion, roughly $850 billion. It's being described in the US and European press as unprecedented, revolutionary, a new path forward for the EU. I know this isn't directly your area because this is in the area of fiscal policy, not monetary, but perhaps you could just explain to our viewers why this is so important and what you think it may accomplish.[end_question] So there have been commentators in the US this morning who have been describing this as a Hamiltonian moment, remembering Alexander Hamilton and his actions as our first Treasury secretary to assume the debts of the different states after the Revolutionary War and thereby pull the United States, the young country together. Do you think that that's an apt comparison to what's been done here by the EU in pulling the countries together and making this common commitment to borrow and then make grants?[end_question] Madam Lagarde, you said last weekend as this deal was being worked out that you hoped that it would be ambitious and not just fast. And I want to ask you whether what's been accomplished meets your test of being ambitious, stepping up to the enormity of the problems.[end_question] So, let's turn to the question that your economists oversee at the European Central Bank, and that is where the European economy is going. And I'd be very interested in your colleagues' forecasts and your own sense of what we can expect, both for the final two quarters of this year and then going into 2021. The numbers that I've seen from the EU suggest a significant contraction this year on the order of 8.7 percent is the latest figure I saw, but then a recovery that's significant, 6.1 percent in 2021. Do those numbers seem right to you? And I'm curious about what bumps in the road you think there might be in terms of achieving the kind of recovery everybody wants.[end_question] So, I take it from what you just said that your economists, forecasters do not see ahead what we refer to as a W, that is to say, we're rising but then we're going to get hit with a second wave and a sharp additional downward trend? It sounds like your numbers don't bear that out.[end_question] So, I think it's important for our viewers to understand that you as president of the ECB don't see that W, don't see us falling off a cliff again based on what you know now.[end_question] Let me ask you, Madam Lagarde, Europe is farther along in the reopening path than the United States is. And I'm very curious what you think Europe is learning about this process of reopening, that is to say, what's sensible and what's risky as you survey the experience of European countries.[end_question] So, this question really is an extension of your answer to the last one. What have Europeans learned in this period about what good political leadership looks like? What's been helpful to Europe as it's made its path out of the initial lockdown?[end_question] This, go ahead, please.[end_question] And I wonder just to ask you to take your provocative and fascinating comment a moment ago a step further, why is it that women were such successful leaders? Chancellor Merkel, obviously, Ursula von der Leyen at the EU similarly, you as the ECB president, why is it that these women have had great success, and let's say honestly, relative to male leaders?[end_question] And in closing this out, I know you're not a politician, but I do want to ask you if you have thoughts for the United States as we're heading toward an election in November, not about which candidate but about what good leadership is.[end_question] Let's talk a little bit about the technical side of your life at the ECB. You're responsible for monetary policy, and my impression is that you've taken a stance very similar to our Fed Chairman Jay Powell in saying that the ECB will do whatever it takes within the limits of its charter to assure financial markets that it will be a provider of liquidity, that it will stand behind the ability to continue orderly trading. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how you've tried to play your monetary hand and what differences, if any, there are between your approach and that of Chairman Powell, here.[end_question] Let me ask just one final blunt question about monetary policy. Some analysts worry about the underlying solvency of many European banks. Yes, there are liquidity problems which the ECB can address through its loans. But in terms of the fundamental capital structure, the resilience of those banks, it's harder for you to do. And I wonder if you'd be willing to comment on that problem, if you think it is a problem, and what the ECB with other sensible financial policymakers can do.[end_question] Let me turn to the question that I know you've reflected on a great deal, and that's what the post-pandemic global economy will look like. And you've done something that's really very interesting and unusual in structuring at least some of your quantitative easing purchases of debt, of assets, towards companies and sectors that are sustainable in terms of their response to global warming, to climate change. So, in effect, you have a green bond portfolio that you're imagining putting together, as I read the news. Tell us a little bit about that. And then respond to the criticism that's made, which is that central banks aren't in the business of making decisions like that that favour one political or policy strategy as opposed to another. What do you tell critics when they say, ah, this green bond stuff is not what a central bank should do?[end_question] We have less than five minutes left, I'm sorry to say. So, I'm going to ask you one more big question where I'd love to hear your thoughts. You've said that you think that this post-pandemic economy will lead to, you said, an acceleration of transformations in the global economy. Obviously, part of that involves what we just had been talking about, the sustainable green aspect of the economy. But there are many other changes that are ahead. And I'm wondering in particular whether you think that the kind of globalization that we experienced for the last several decades really is going to, is going to make a turn, that we'll be facing a more decoupled, more limited global economy, whether we'll have major disruptions of industries that just don't work as well in a post-pandemic world as they did before. What do you, what do you think when you think about these accelerating transformations? What are some of them?[end_question] Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, you've given us a wonderful half-hour example of how women are leading in key aspects of our recovery from the global pandemic. We're grateful for your insight. We hope that you'll be able to get on a plane before too long and come see us here in Washington. We miss you, and we hope we can do this event face to face in the near future. But thank you so much, Madam Lagarde, for joining us this morning to discuss the path forward.[end_question] Disclaimer","Thank you so much, David. It's a pleasure to see you and to be with you and to say hello to my friends in Washington.[end_answer] David, I think it is, it is important because for the first time, albeit on a temporary basis and to deal with the emergency situation, the 27 member states comprising the European Union have decided to jointly borrow in order to support those member states that were most affected by COVID-19. So, this is clearly a demonstration of solidarity, of transfer to those that need it most, and it's the first time that, you know, there is such joint borrowing of that magnitude.[end_answer] You know, I don't think that history actually repeats itself, and comparisons are odious. But I think it's a breakthrough in that at a time of shock, where the economy is massively, brutally impacted, I mean, just think for a second. In a matter of two quarters the euro area will have lost as much output as it has gained over the last 15 years. So that gives you an idea of the violence of the economic shock. So, in response to that, in a determination and decisiveness, solidarity act, the member states have said, okay, let's borrow together. So it's not an assumption of the debts from the past, you know, each country keeps its own lot of debt from the past, but it's a determination to move forward together and to particularly help those that have been massively affected by COVID-19 and which did not have actually the fiscal space to respond as they should have.[end_answer] The total envelope that they've agreed is €750 billion, as you say, north of $850 billion, and that's just for the, what they call the recovery and resilience plan. In addition to that, they've also discussed a seven-years budget that is north of a trillion euros. What I think was important was the right allocation of how much was going to be grants, in other words, joint borrowing allocated, given if you will, to those member states that need it most, namely, you know, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, but also Poland and many countries actually will benefit from that portion, and how much was going to be loans that will have to be refunded by those countries that borrow. And I think the proportion is reasonable. It was hoped in the first place that it would be two-thirds grants, one-third loans. It ended up being a little under €400 billion of grants and 350 of loans. So, you still have more grants than loans. But it's, you know, it's a good balance. It could have been better, but it's a very it's a very ambitious project, actually.[end_answer] You're right. The numbers you've mentioned are our baseline. A contraction of 8.7 this year and a clear pickup next year and the year after. It's the baseline. We have also worked on scenarios, as most economists have done. The mild scenario, which is a little better, which is in the range of -5 percent, and severe scenario, which is -12ish percent. We, for the moment, the numbers that we're getting for the second quarter would comfort us in the idea that our baseline is probably in the right place. But obviously those things can change, and forecasting is a difficult exercise, particularly at the moment when you are missing some of the usual tools to measure the economic progress and the creation of value. What could actually derail this baseline which seems to be in the right place now, would be a massive second wave, would be a re-confinement of significant scope, would be, you know, any catastrophic development that you can think of, of course, in geopolitical terms. But in economic terms, back here in Europe and in the euro area in particular the, what could aggravate the baseline is a major second wave. And by the way, because you're a man of numbers as well, those numbers that you've mentioned do incorporate a minimal element of second waves, you know, the flaring up that we see here and there in small clusters and against which instant action is taken by the various policymakers. So that's taken into account. If it was a second massive wave of the kind that we have faced back in early March, then it would be a different story.[end_answer] No. No, they don't. They don't. And I'm not sure exactly what letter of our alphabet our forecast would correspond to. What I know, though, David, is that this recovery is uneven, is uncertain. And, you know, it's the first time that we're actually making a projection. We had operated on the basis of scenarios before that. So, it's going to be touch and go. But for the moment, given the numbers that we have given, the survey numbers, the very unconventional elements that we have, you know, some of the big data providers are now analysing traffic or use of cards, payment cards and instant payment to actually understand whether the economy is picking up or not, and to what extent people are back into the normal or quasi-normal consumption.[end_answer] Based on what we know and, you know, barring any massive second wave, we certainly don't see this W that you're talking about, no.[end_answer] I think what we are, what we have seen is a very gradual de-confinement where precautions were still either mandatory or highly recommended. So to give you an example, despite the fact that people were allowed back in cafés and terraces, as is often the case in Europe to have a glass of beer or a café, people were still asked to wear their masks in any confined places where there was, that was open to the public. So, whenever you went to, still today, when you go to a shop, when you go to the hairdresser, when you go to a restaurant, social distance is the rule, mask is the principle, and that is learning number one. The exit out of strict lockdown was very gradual, very thoughtful, very patient. And it was not an easy exercise, neither for policymakers nor for the people themselves. But we observed a really strong discipline throughout, and a good understanding that, you know, you had to guard against the temptation all the time if you wanted to protect not only yourself but others. I think the second learning was that we were all in this together. And clearly taking measures in one part of the country or one part of Europe was not enough and that those measures had to be taken together. It was a bit laborious in the first place, and there was the odd, you know, decision here or there to go solo, but in the main I think we learned that by working together and by moving together it was much safer.[end_answer] I'm going to be, I'm going to be extremely biased, David, and I'm not going to be a central banker at this very moment, but I would say that for myself I've learned that women tend to do a better job. It's quite fascinating, actually. When you look at those countries that were led by women and the path that they took and the policies that they adopted and the communication style that was in play was quite stunning. So, this is my woman's bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias. I think what …[end_answer] I think the other aspect of policy communication that worked, as I observed it here, was the very honest, transparent and sometimes almost scientific approach that some of the policymakers adopted. When I look at what Chancellor Merkel has done here in Germany for instance, she very, very transparently shared data, numbers, casualties, rate of contaminations, and so on and so forth. And it became very quickly sort of common, you know, lingua franca, common knowledge that people would understand those scientific elements that enabled them to appreciate why certain measures were necessary such as masks, such as being confined, such as keeping social distances. I think that's, you know, from what I have observed in a few of the European countries that I know best, that seems to have worked well.[end_answer] You know, I was also thinking of those other leaders around the world. You look at the leader in Taiwan, in Belgium, in New Zealand. Many of those leaders, prime ministers or presidents that have also communicated well and carried the water of bad news as well as the water of clear explanation and strong recommendations.[end_answer] You know, I don't want to comment on any particular country. But, you know, leading is about inspiring, is about being both responsible and accountable, is about caring as well. I think, you know, you asked me the question about what is special about those, some of those women. I think the caring dimension is something that they manage to express well, and that was considered by viewers and voters probably as authentic.[end_answer] Well, first of all I'd like to pay tribute to him, because we really had a very good working relationship. We cooperated. We compared notes. We talked to each other on a regular basis at the height of the crisis and subsequently. One of the key differences is that he has a Treasury Department not far, and they can be strong interconnection relationships between them, and there is clearly, there are links that cannot be established at this point in time between the European Central Bank and a euro fiscal authority that still doesn't exist at this point. So, I think that that's the key difference number one. Key difference number two is that the markets are very different. A lot of the financing here in Europe is handled through banks. So, some of my programmes here at the ECB were directed at the banks, and we made financing available at very, very attractive conditions through the national central banks that constitutes the whole euro system of which the ECB is the center. But we made those loans available to banks, because they are the ones that actually provide the financing to corporates, to enterprises, to SMEs, to households. In the United States you have very different markets where the bank intermediation doesn't matter as much because you have a much deeper and more vibrant capital market, which is the source of financing for, you know, most of the corporates. So that's another big difference that clearly has driven us to design programs differently. He had a whole list of specifically designed financing tools and instruments that were, that identified particular segments of the markets. We had a massive financing that we called the targeted long-term refinancing operations, which was really a massive financing tool for the banking sector throughout the euro area. I think that I've identified a few differences for you here.[end_answer] You know, I think the European banks are much more solid than they were at the time of the great financial crisis. Their equity is strong. Their capital ratios are high. They have buffers to guard against the potential shocks. I think what distinguishes them from some of their U.S. counterparts is the fact that their profitability is lower, and that is a factor of many different reasons that it would take too long to go into. But I wouldn't say that European banks are, have solvency issues, not at all. Not at all. I would say that what would be desirable and what we are certainly encouraging is more consolidation, because there are banking systems in some European countries that are too fragmented, where there are many small institutions, and where clearly consolidation would reinforce them. And if we can see cross-border consolidation as well, even better. So, we are trying to change the regulatory framework in such a way that it does not prevent, it doesn't hamper possible consolidations. So, we'll see.[end_answer] Yeah, and if everybody looks at those issues and says, oh, this is not really my mandate or this is not really for me to do, this is always for somebody else, I would caution against that for anybody who's tempted to go in that direction. Let me just step back for a second. Forty percent of green bonds around the world are issued in Euro. So that gives us an indication of how strong that percentage of the market is. We buy 20 percent of all available green bonds, we the ECB. But apart from that, most of our purchases are not directed at corporate bonds, which is where you can actually distinguish between the brown, the not so brown, the green the very green. But most of our purchases are directed at sovereign bonds. And in that particular category, you cannot distinguish between greenish or not so green. You buy sovereign bonds. And it is obviously for governments, for policymakers to decide how much they want to respect or comply with the Paris Agreement that they've signed, and I certainly hope that they do. What directionally I hope we achieve is moving in the direction of being more active on the green bond sector that will itself be expanding. And what I have said is that we need to explore each and every activity that we have to see how climate change and the risks associated with climate change would affect our policies. I for one believe that price stability, which is the mandate of the ECB, we don't have two mandates like Jay Powell does; Jay has price stability and full employment; we only have price stability. But I contend that price stability can be significantly affected by climate change, and that as a result of that, if we want to deliver on our mandate, we have to be not only mindful but also take action in order to prevent climate change from affecting that price stability that is our mandate. So, I think that the two are intrinsically related and bound and require that actually we take those matters seriously into account, even though we are central bankers.[end_answer] One is, I agree with you, acceleration of transformations. Those things were already there. And I can think of green. I use that, you know, as it's a bit an oversimplification, but let's use that. An economy that is more green, that is more digital and that will value proximity more than it did before. Now on the latter part, will that entail industrial sunset in some countries and the rise of new supply chain that would be more partner-based and more into proximity than into cost-cutting by all means and irrespective of the stretch of the supply chain? It would seem like it. And you know, it's difficult to predict what will happen. But this shock has been so brutal and so harsh, and it's not over yet, that everybody is rethinking and reconsidering. Why would I fly to all corners of the world as often as I have rather than use some of those technological device in order to talk to people and share ideas and communicate? Why would I buy unnecessarily many things that are cheap when I can actually access something that is more in my proximity? Why don't I use more digital devices in order to enrich my culture? I mean, those are sort of obviously advanced economy preoccupations, and it's a whole different ballgame when you think about some of those developing countries and fragile countries around the world that also depend on some of those supply chains. So how this is going to pan out and how we will continue to be mindful of all communities around the world, whether vulnerable, fragile, or advanced, is something that will require cooperation amongst ourselves. So, I think that multilateralism is not dead. This is the old IMF managing director inside me that is speaking, and I salute my, all my colleagues there. But I believe that those sort of natural reframing of our economies are going to have to be mindful of what happens in other corners of the world to make sure that it is actually sustainable, because that's another learning of this COVID-19, is that we are all so-interrelated and so dependent on each other in the face of those global massive challenges that come to hit us and will come back to haunt us if we don't deal with them.",[],[],1956,F,France,2019 -,[],[],0,0,15679,[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
346,2020-07-21,Interview with Expansión,Isabel Schnabel,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in200721~eed22f9cd9.en.html,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andrés Stumpf on 16 July and published on 21 July 2020","The last meeting didn’t lead to any new stimulus measures. Has the ECB already done enough?[end_question] And are you comfortable with that situation?[end_question] The asset purchases have slowed down in the past few weeks. Does this have anything to do with the improvement that you mentioned?[end_question] There are doubts about whether or not the ECB will use the full envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which now stands at €1.35 trillion.[end_question] If the situation were to worsen, does the ECB have any tools left? You always seem to have something else in your toolkit.[end_question] By increasing the purchase volume again? The markets are already discussing the possibility of that.[end_question] In the current environment, when we’re already talking about trillions of euro in purchases, does an increase by hundreds of millions still have an impact?[end_question] There has also been a lot of talk about the possibility of you buying fallen angel debt (debt that has lost its investment grade rating), but you haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a controversial measure?[end_question] So it might be a possibility in the future?[end_question] One concern about the programme is the capital key. How will the purchases converge towards the capital key? Could it be done through the reinvestments? We don’t know much about those…[end_question] Moving away from the purchases, the liquidity injected into the banking system (targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTRO III) is another of the measures that you have taken. There has been a take-up of €1.3 trillion. Has the limit already been reached?[end_question] This liquidity is conditional on loans being granted, but quite a few people are concerned that the banks are using it to purchase sovereign debt. Are you monitoring this? Is it something you’re worried about?[end_question] But is the ECB at all interested in banks purchasing sovereign debt to relieve the pressure on your purchase programme?[end_question] Credit is currently flowing at record levels.[end_question] You have signalled that you do not want monetary policy to be conditioned by the markets. But is it not conditioned, in some fashion, because of the most indebted countries? Their debt levels are being described as unsustainable…[end_question] So if inflation were to shoot up next month, would the ECB be obliged to abandon its stimulus programmes?[end_question] I understand that the ECB is much less constrained by one-off increases in inflation than it was in the past. Is that the case? Because in the past we saw the ECB raise rates in such a situation…[end_question] Public opinion of the ECB in Germany has improved a lot recently, hasn’t it?[end_question] On the other side of public opinion you have the ruling of the German Constitutional Court, which indicated that the ECB has exceeded its competences with its debt purchases. The conflict seems to have been resolved, but did it condition your actions?[end_question] This crisis seems to have struck Spain especially hard. How do you see the situation there?[end_question] How do you assess last European Council’s discussions?[end_question] What about Spain’s financial sector?[end_question] Disclaimer","Our decisions are guided by the incoming data, so we continuously monitor what is happening in the economy and financial markets. We calibrate our measures based on these data. Our latest macroeconomic projections were published in June, which was when we decided to expand our measures because we saw that the economic and, in particular, the inflation outlook had deteriorated substantially.[end_answer] We’ve now seen some upside surprises but they are not sufficient to make us change course from our baseline scenario, which projects an 8.7% drop in real GDP in 2020. There was hence no reason to revise our decision from the previous meeting. In any case, we have certainly seen an improvement in the financial data, compared with the situation back in March. Markets have calmed down quite a bit. Nevertheless, financial conditions are still somewhat tighter than they were before the pandemic.[end_answer] Our measures take time to fully take effect. That does not happen overnight. Besides, monetary policy is not alone in providing support to the economy. Fiscal policy also plays a very important role, and we have seen a lot of action there as well.[end_answer] Markets must be careful not to read too much into data that show short-term variations in the pace of our asset purchases. These purchases are determined by various factors, including seasonality. There is typically less activity in both the primary and secondary markets during summertime. That’s one reason why the monthly volume of purchases may drop.[end_answer] The PEPP envelope was calibrated to meet two objectives: to counter the risks to the medium-term inflation outlook due to the pandemic, and to prevent market fragmentation and ensure the transmission of our policy to the entire euro area. As long as we remain in the baseline scenario of our projections, it’s likely that the envelope will be used in full. Of course, upside or downside surprises are both possible in a situation with so much uncertainty.[end_answer] The balance of risks is currently still tilted to the downside in our view. It would be very good news if we were to see such an improvement in the outlook that we could use less of the envelope. That’s not the case for the time being, so the size of the current envelope remains appropriate.[end_answer] Let’s not forget that, not so long ago, many people were saying that the ECB had run out of ammunition. Our response to this crisis has clearly shown that we have a large and effective monetary policy toolbox at our disposal. We have, in fact, expanded our set of tools during this period, to be able to fulfil our mandate. And we can adjust our existing tools or create new tools in the future if necessary. I can assure you that we are in no way constrained in that sense.[end_answer] Whenever we take a new measure, some market participants already predict that we are going to do more. It is important that markets properly understand our reaction function. We link our decisions to the developments that we see in the data. It is crucial to avoid a situation in which the markets end up dictating what decisions we take.[end_answer] The current purchase programme has been calibrated on the basis of the data in the current macroeconomic environment. This won’t change just because investors are expecting more. What would have to change is the data.[end_answer] We are seeing that this programme is very effective and it does make an important difference how much we buy in addition to the total purchases that have already been conducted.[end_answer] The truth is that, at least for the moment, we have not seen waves of rating downgrades for companies or countries that are on the brink of losing their investment grade ratings. So there is no urgency for us to discuss this now in relation to our asset purchases. But we are, of course, aware of the risk that credit rating downgrades could have procyclical effects, and this is something that we are monitoring very closely. And we are accepting this type of debt as part of the collateral that banks can provide when seeking central bank liquidity.[end_answer] I would not rule out this possibility completely, but it’s not on our agenda at the moment.[end_answer] Our only decision on this issue is what was published in the press release following the June Governing Council meeting. Maturing securities purchased under the PEPP will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022 and the decision to stop reinvestments will depend on the situation that we find ourselves in at that time. The end of the reinvestments should not interfere with our monetary policy stance.[end_answer] Our purchases of public debt securities under the PEPP are guided by the capital key and we are currently using the flexibility of the programme to deviate from it, if necessary. The question that we will have to answer in due course is how, and to what extent, we will later converge back towards the capital key. It seems clear that the reinvestment phase can play a role here, but we haven’t decided on this yet.[end_answer] There is still capacity for some banks to ask for more liquidity. But there was clearly a huge incentive for banks to take part in the first big operation, which ensured the maximum benefit from the extremely attractive conditions. In my view, we have already seen the largest part of the take-up although we might still see some additional demand in the upcoming operations of this kind.[end_answer] The design of the programme is very clear. It provides incentives for banks to continue lending to the real economy, which is what makes this tool so attractive from our perspective. We know that banks can be reluctant to lend in times of crisis, which could reinforce the downturn, so the conditionality linked to this liquidity is very important. Having said that, the funds allotted through the TLTROs cannot be earmarked for a specific purpose.[end_answer] That is not our objective. The aim is to ensure that credit continues to flow despite the crisis, and that banks are lending to the real economy. If you look at the potential returns that banks can generate from lending, it continues to be more attractive on average, even when adjusted for risk, to lend to non-financial companies than to purchase domestic public debt. Therefore, we believe that this is a sufficient incentive to lend, even if banks have already reached the minimum lending threshold required by the conditions of the programme.[end_answer] In any case, the volume of debt issuances of both sovereigns and firms has shot up, and we are aware that some of the new bonds will be purchased by banks. This can be a stabilising factor in times of crisis, but the previous crisis taught us that a strong interconnection between banks and domestic sovereigns can cause other types of problems. Therefore, such a situation should generally be avoided, and breaking this link was and is one of the main aims of the banking union. To achieve this, all the pillars of the banking union need to be completed.[end_answer] Our measures seem to have worked very well so far, and we have indeed seen a strong increase in lending volumes. This was absolutely crucial, especially in the first few months, because during the lockdown period many firms suffered a total collapse in their revenues, and the banks played a crucial role in allowing firms to draw down their credit lines to weather the storm. Banks are a key part of the solution to this crisis.[end_answer] This is clearly exaggerated. Even at the height of the crisis no Member State was close to losing market access. There is a debate about fiscal dominance and some have raised doubts about whether we will ever be able to stop our purchases. In fact, we have shown in the past that we can stop our net asset purchases. When the time comes, we will reduce our asset purchases, depending on the inflation outlook. We have a clear legal framework that prevents us from conducting monetary financing, so every decision we take has to be linked to our mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term.[end_answer] We look at inflation over the medium term, so if there is a sudden increase in prices, but it is a one-off event, it will not affect our decision-making. It has to be something persistent.[end_answer] If that were to happen, we would carefully assess what the appropriate response is. The aim of all our decisions is to bring inflation closer to a level of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. However, we can adjust the speed at which this happens. And there we have to take the side effects of our measures into account, for example the effects on our secondary objectives that are also defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU or on financial stability. So even if inflation were to increase, we would not raise interest rates immediately if doing so would tip the economy into a recession. Over the medium term, such a rate hike could be even more damaging to price stability. So we have some flexibility.[end_answer] This is not so much related to constraints; it is a policy decision. The Governing Council has to continuously discuss the pros and cons of its decisions, within the flexibility permitted by our mandate.[end_answer] In Germany and elsewhere in the euro area, people are acknowledging that the ECB has done a lot to avert a financial crisis, which is what we were facing in March. Our actions seem to have had a positive effect on how the ECB is perceived. I put a lot of effort into communicating better with the citizens of the euro area, especially those who view our measures critically, to try to explain why we do what we do and how it is helping all parts of the euro area.[end_answer] The Federal Constitutional Court argued that we had not sufficiently demonstrated the proportionality of our measures. In reality, we are constantly doing just that. So one of the factors that appear to have led to this ruling was that we have not been sufficiently transparent about the reasoning behind the decisions we take. Therefore, it makes sense that we are talking more openly about all of this, so the public understands that we are always carefully considering the proportionality of our actions and that we take this very seriously. In that sense, the ruling of the Constitutional Court has been positive. In any case, it has not constrained our actions.[end_answer] Spain is one of the countries that has been most affected by the pandemic and the crisis. Relative to the severity of the crisis, the fiscal response may prove to be insufficient. The fiscal space is more limited than in some other countries because debt levels were already high before the crisis, and it is important to avoid them becoming excessively high. Therefore, the European recovery fund is incredibly important, especially for Spain. This virus has already caused too much suffering, and Europe has to make sure that the economic consequences are cushioned as much as possible, also to avoid a divergence of economic developments in different parts of the euro area.[end_answer] Spain was one of the euro area’s success stories before this crisis broke. There were many challenges, but the country managed to handle them well. I think it is important that Europe shows the same level of determination now to fight this crisis. The ECB is playing its part. The measures to ensure the flow of credit are particularly relevant for a country like Spain that has a large share of small and medium-sized enterprises.[end_answer] It is good news that the European Council seems to be coming closer to a solution even if the initial proposal has been watered down somewhat. The proposed package is likely to include a substantial grant component, which is particularly important for those countries that have been hit hardest by the pandemic and that have more limited fiscal space, such as Spain. There are still many details to be determined but discussions appear to be moving broadly in the right direction. I hope Europe will show that, in spite of all the differences among Member States, it can stand together and provide a common solution.[end_answer] Spain’s financial sector has become much stronger after the restructuring efforts launched in 2012, and this has helped Spanish banks enter this crisis with fairly solid levels of capital. Therefore, they should be able to support the Spanish economy through this crisis.","['inflation outlook had deteriorated', 'counter the risks to the medium-term inflation', 'look at inflation',

352,2020-06-22,Interview with Der Spiegel,Luis de Guindos,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in200622~3bd6510157.en.html,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Tim Bartz and Stefan Kaiser on 15 June and published on 22 June 2020","Because of the Corona pandemic, the ECB is buying euro area[end_question] The ECB is currently discussing a new strategy. We have a suggestion for you: Call out 0.5 or 1.0 percent as the new inflation target, then you will have virtually fulfilled your mandate in no time and can stop buying bonds.[end_question] Perhaps you are also measuring inflation incorrectly. Residential property has been getting more expensive for years, stock prices are rising, and many people feel that life as a whole is becoming much more expensive than the official data suggest.[end_question] If asset prices for real estate and stocks continue to rise, the rich will become even richer. Those who have little or no assets will go away empty-handed. That increases social inequality.[end_question] Is it even possible to get out of crisis policy? The US central bank, the Fed, tried to do so at the end of 2018, raising interest rates and sending global capital markets into a panic.[end_question] Do you really think that's still possible? The ECB itself says that factors such as the ageing of society and globalisation are exerting long-term pressure on inflation. Then you will never again reach your inflation target of just under two percent and will continue to do so with bond purchases and give critics a cause for allegations of implicit government financing[end_question] Are you breaking the law because you are buying many more Italian government bonds than the country's capital key at the ECB? Most recently, you bought about 20 percent Italian securities, but according to the capital key it would only be 14 percent.[end_question] What do you mean?[end_question] You would simply have to extend the program again and again, so you would never have to prove that you are following the rules, because the final settlement never comes.[end_question] How do you actually explain the boom on the stock markets? After the outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe and the USA, the markets slumped by more than 30 percent, and have since recovered their losses. How can that be?[end_question] So you think that stock markets exaggerate and share prices will fall again?[end_question] What is the mood in the ECB towers? At the last meeting under former President Mario Draghi in autumn 2019, the massive crack in the central bank Council due to Draghi's monetary policy became apparent. Now the situation seems more relaxed. Is the pandemic masking the crack?[end_question] The decisive factor is one percent disagreement. Like in autumn 2019, when the ECB suddenly started buying government bonds again. And at that time the coronavirus did not even exist.[end_question] Does that also apply to the head of the Bundesbank? The fact is that the Federal Government now handles money much more loosely and reacts more pragmatically to the crisis. Do you notice this new German flexibility also in Jens Weidmann?[end_question] What about the Bundesbank?[end_question] As independent as the Federal Constitutional Court. That accuses the ECB of disproportionate and poorly communicated monetary policy. What next?[end_question] Meaning: the Bundesbank has the buck.[end_question] Why is it always the Germans who cause trouble?[end_question] But they seem to have the biggest problem with the ECB's monetary policy, and above all they fear inflation more than the other Europeans.[end_question] Should Jens Weidmann send out this message more strongly because it apparently has too little resonance in Germany?[end_question] Wouldn't it be better if the ECB focused its strategy much more strongly on growth rather than inflation in the future, if only to end this eternal cycle of complaints against your monetary policy?[end_question] As ex-Economy Minister of Spain, you must have an opinion on such a question.[end_question] As Vice-President of the ECB, you are responsible for financial stability and the banks. Are you sure that the banks in the eurozone are strong enough to absorb credit defaults, which will certainly come?[end_question] So what must the banks do?[end_question] Is it true ECB has set up a taskforce to look into the idea of creating a European bad bank?[end_question] Disclaimer","Monetary financing is prohibited by the Treaty and ECB’s decisions are driven by our price stability mandate. We are experiencing a severe economic crisis. Our forecasts predict that, in the medium scenario, the euro area economy will shrink by almost nine percent in 2020 and that prices will only rise by 0.3 percent. This is significantly lower than our inflation target of just under two percent. We are therefore buying more bonds in order to promote economic growth, achieve our inflation target and prevent fragmentation in the euro area, a too strong tightening of financing conditions in euro area countries. We are acting solely according to the principles of our mandate. Against this big drop in GDP and inflation, we had to act. It is our duty to do the necessary within our mandate.[end_answer] It's really not that simple. But yes, in the context of the strategy review, we will be looking at the inflation target. We will also listen to a wide range of stakeholders, academics, civil society.[end_answer] Eurostat calculates inflation for the euro area on the basis of data from each country. This measurement of inflation is considered appropriate. However, it is always possible to improve it and we are looking into this, e.g. the treatment of owner-occupied housing. In our strategy review we will take great account of what you mention in your comments. Unfortunately, the pandemic postponed the work, we now aim at presenting the new strategy in mid-2021.[end_answer] The best policy against social inequality is to create growth and jobs. Monetary policy has greatly helped to achieve this. Please do not forget that, in the present juncture, as in 2015 and 2016, we have deflationary pressures that we have to deter.[end_answer] The ECB also decided in 2018 to stop net purchases of government bonds. So you can see that we can get out if the economic conditions and inflation data allow it. At that time, we had to relaunch the programme after ten months due to economic weakness and decreasing price pressure. But if the situation improves and the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level which is in line with our mandate, we can return to exit mode.[end_answer] I see no reason why inflation shouldn't increase again. At the moment, the pandemic is depressing global demand and oil prices, and therefore consumer prices. Our forecasts are clear in that they will remain low for some time. But de-globalisation and the disruption of global value chains could also be pushing inflation up.[end_answer] No, for the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the benchmark allocation continues to be the capital key, but we use the flexibility it offers us over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions.[end_answer] Above all, that in the end there will be a reckoning. We will ensure convergence to the capital key.[end_answer] I cannot foresee what will happen and therefore I cannot rule out extending the programme, but we’ve clearly said that our pandemic emergency purchase programme is temporary and under the current conditions we have stipulated that the programme will end in June 2021. Until then, we are using the flexibility we have.[end_answer] There could be two factors at play: the measures promptly taken by the central bank and governments to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic generated some optimism. In addition, until recently, the view that the public health pandemic has been largely controlled had prevailed. All this had a positive impact on the stock markets. But we also know that markets sometimes overreact, both downwards and upwards. At the start of the pandemic we saw large drops in equity prices.[end_answer] I wouldn't say that. It will depend on the evolution of the pandemic. Ultimately, stock markets must remain realistic: we are facing a recession in the euro area.[end_answer] The past is the past. And I think that Mario Draghi’s successor Christine Lagarde took office with the intention of listening to everyone. Also in Draghi’s times, 99 percent of all decisions were taken unanimously.[end_answer] There are always nuances. There are very knowledgeable people in the Governing Council, who sometimes vote differently. But in general, the degree of agreement is enormous.[end_answer] The German economic stimulus package is very positive. Such programmes are the first line of defence to minimise the consequences of the pandemic. The German government's response is the right one and Germany has the financial leeway to react quickly and intensively. I believe that a fiscal response is also necessary on a pan-European level. It's not only about the size and scope of the programme, but about the message. A European response makes it very clear that there is a response from the core and the heart of the EU. And that is politically very important.[end_answer] I don't comment on the Bundesbank’s view. The Bundesbank has always taken a cooperative and positive attitude and made important and relevant contributions. The Bundesbank is a very, very independent institution. I can assure you of that.[end_answer] Our position is clear: we are a European institution and are subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice accountable to the EU Parliament as well as the European Court of Auditors. We have taken note of the judgment from Karlsruhe. Our monetary policy decisions have always been proportionate and appropriate. I expect that the Federal Government and the Bundestag will react to this. We stand ready to cooperate with the Bundesbank and to provide information to facilitate the response that the German institutions have to give to the Constitutional Court. So we are ready to cooperate, but always with full respect of our independence.[end_answer] Well, that's your way of saying things. Once again: we are under the control of the European institutions, but we are open to cooperate with the German institutions. That is the approach.[end_answer] I don't think it's the Germans who make trouble. You know, it's the largest country in the euro area.[end_answer] Inflation is well below our target. In addition, Germany's growth rate has been positive over the past ten years, Germany is a very competitive economy, and the favourable euro exchange rate has also been positive. So I think that the euro has been very beneficial for the German economy and that this is recognised by most Germans.[end_answer] I cannot speak on his behalf. But when I listen to his remarks in the Governing Council of the ECB, I can agree very often with his comments.[end_answer] Our mandate is enshrined in the Treaty, it has been decided by governments and parliaments, and we have no say. Whether the treaties and the mandate will be changed in the future is not known, certainly not a matter for today.[end_answer] I had other priorities then. We had a difficult time, the recovery of the Spanish economy was very important. So I concentrated on other type of issues.[end_answer] European banks are, on average, in a much better capital and liquidity situation than ten years ago. The problem of European banks is that their profitability was very, very low even before the pandemic. This is clearly reflected in bank valuations in the stock markets. So profitability is the real problem. And I think that the pandemic will make this situation even worse. Since the beginning of the crisis, the valuations of European banks have fallen by 30 percent. I think that this also justifies the rapid policy responses to the pandemic.[end_answer] Cost cutting, reducing excess capacity and – for some of them - consolidating domestically and across borders. Much of what has been necessary already in the past is now completely unavoidable.[end_answer] We haven’t taken any decision or entered into any detail about this. It’s premature having this discussion now.","['inflation target', 'inflation target', 'big drop in GDP and inflation', 'inflation target', 'calculates inflation', 'measurement of inflation',

354,2020-06-14,Interview with ABC,Luis de Guindos,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in200614~717384384f.en.html,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by María Jesús Pérez on 9 June 2020 and published on 14 June 2020","European economics and finance ministers met on Tuesday to discuss the EU recovery plan to deal with a post-COVID-19 scenario using guarantees. Why wasn’t there an agreement?[end_question] In any case, the coronavirus crisis is wreaking havoc on the world economy. In Europe, for example, the ECB was expecting the economy to grow by 0.8% this year. But last week ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that it would contract by 8.7% in 2020, which is a downward revision to your projections of almost 10% and an “unprecedented contraction” in the euro area economy. Is the situation likely to worsen or will the support packages approved by the Eurogroup and by the ECB be enough to bring about a recovery?[end_question] Are you ruling out an increase in the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) after the summer, or is another new injection of funds possible?[end_question] Do you monitor whether this capital is being used correctly?[end_question] In general, countries spend, then they borrow to pay for their spending, and to ensure that the cost of debt doesn’t weigh too heavily on their budgets, the ECB buys that debt. Then what? Don’t you think we’ll be living in a world flooded with liquidity, with lots of social expenditure, very limited productive investment and high levels of unemployment?[end_question] It finally seems that support for the southern European countries will come, despite the reluctance of their northern counterparts. Do you think there will be any strings attached to this support? Will the support for Spain come without any conditions?[end_question] The Banco de España’s projections for the Spanish economy and its recovery have been another heavy blow. It previously warned that extending the lockdown would mean a longer recession and higher unemployment, but nobody listened. Yesterday it made further downward revisions to its GDP and unemployment forecasts given the lack of effective measures from the government. You said that if things are done correctly, we will see a rebound and a return to pre-crisis levels of activity. Have you changed your view after seeing the Banco de España’s forecasts?[end_question] How can they do that?[end_question] [end_question] And is Spain doing the right things to bring about this rebound? Are the measures taken the ones that we need? Are they the right ones? What still needs to be done?[end_question] By cutting public spending and putting up taxes?[end_question] You were in favour of a minimum income, but one which was temporary and linked to the length and impact of the pandemic. What do you think about the minimum income that has finally been approved in Spain?[end_question] In your view, what have other countries done better than Spain to manage the crisis?[end_question] In your opinion, economic policy in Europe should focus on saving as many businesses as possible. The Spanish government has opted to focus its support measures on workers, with moratoria, the ERTE scheme and subsidies. But in many cases these aren’t reaching the workers or are taking a long time to reach them. What do you make of this?[end_question] Do you take it as a positive that the ERTE scheme may be extended until December in specific sectors?[end_question] Is there concern at European level that Spain has a government with so many diverse viewpoints, and that there is so much improvisation and haste to implement measures which are perhaps not in line with the European project?[end_question] Some experts, pundits and even politicians with different views to those at the heart of government are raising doubts about whether the issue of nationalisation has been completely resolved at European level. It has been approved that, in certain situations, the government may become a shareholder in companies that are failing as a result of the coronavirus crisis.[end_question] What is your take on the political tension we have recently been seeing in Spain’s lower house? Shouldn’t there be greater unity and consensus to get the country out of what is the most severe economic crisis it has seen since the Civil War?[end_question] The European Banking Authority has confirmed that Spanish banks are facing the coronavirus crisis with the lowest level of capital in Europe, while noting that they were among those with the lowest leverage ratios. How will the banks, and Spanish banks in particular, recover from this crisis? Were they ready to deal with a crisis of this kind?[end_question] Will mergers make a return? How many banks should Spain have for the system to be entirely cleaned up? Should three big banks absorb all the others?[end_question] Regarding the cancellation of dividends, will the ECB “recommend” that payments be suspended beyond October? What measures will it take against banks that don’t comply with its recommendation?[end_question] Will the ECB create a bad bank in the end?[end_question] What is your opinion on borders opening back up and flows of tourists as the summer approaches?[end_question] To reopen and revive the economy, isn’t it a great idea that we’re now talking about revoking the labour market reforms?[end_question] Given what we’ve seen and what we’ve gone through, how many times a day do you give thanks for having left the Spanish government when you did?[end_question] One last question. Mário Centeno’s departure from the neighbouring Portuguese government opens the door to his succession at the helm of the Eurogroup, and apparently the Spanish Vice-President Nadia Calviño is among the candidates. What do you think of her potential candidacy? Spain would once again have several representatives in very important financial institutions.[end_question] Spain already suffered a “bailout” during the last crisis, although not the entire country, just the financial sector. You witnessed it first-hand. Do you think Spain will end up being bailed out? Some economists are sure it will be, although they say they would not describe it in this way...[end_question] Still on the subject of Spain, when times were good, the country did not reduce its debt levels and is now facing the crisis from a poor starting position. Will this debt not be a burden for future generations and hamper the recovery and our ability to create jobs again if we don’t solve this issue?[end_question] Disclaimer","A consensus has not been reached yet and some countries seem reluctant to sign an agreement, but we are confident that they will be able to do so at the end of July. A strong European response is essential to ensure that every country is included in the recovery.[end_answer] There is currently a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the economic projections. GDP fell by 3.6% in Europe in the first quarter. Our projections see GDP shrinking by 13% in the second quarter, and we expect the economy to start to recover from the third quarter onwards. That would mean an overall decline of 8.7%. However, there is so much uncertainty that we are working with three potential scenarios. These range from the mildest, which is very unlikely and entails a decline of just under 6%, to the most severe, in which we see GDP declining by over 12%. The final data will be determined by economic developments once most of the restrictions that we have been living under as a result of the need to impose a lockdown have been lifted. We saw the worst of the situation around the middle of April.[end_answer] We have just increased the PEPP. We started with €750 billion in March and we increased that by €600 billion to €1,350 billion on 4 June, with purchases that will be conducted until at least the first half of 2021. It’s an enormous purchase volume and comes on top of the Asset Purchase Programme (APP), the ordinary debt purchase programme that we already had, with purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion, and to which we added a further €120 billion in March. With all of this, our purchases would come to €1,700 billion, which is a huge amount. And, depending on economic conditions and our inflation projections, we are always open to recalibrating the programme.[end_answer] Our purchases are not conditional. To decide on the appropriateness and proportionality of the programme, the ECB takes into account inflation expectations, which are now lower than before the pandemic, and financial conditions. We try to prevent a tightening of financial conditions because that would have a severe impact on credit and sovereign bonds and could lead to fragmentation in the euro area. The asset purchases are allocated in accordance with the capital key, which is calculated based on the GDP and population of each country. And in the PEPP we have greater flexibility in its implementation.[end_answer] The ECB focuses on its inflation aim and on ensuring that there isn’t a tightening of financial conditions, because that would have very negative consequences and we must prevent any fragmentation in the bond markets. We are taking the necessary measures to tackle the pandemic. The quality of public finances is the responsibility of governments and the European Commission, which, as it’s known, in the current circumstances, will not be calling for the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. At the ECB, as I’ve already said, our actions are guided by our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The current projections show inflation at 1.3% in 2022, so we are still a long way from the aim and our stimulus measures are necessary.[end_answer] It’s very important that the European Commission’s recovery plan for the post-COVID-19 economy is approved, not only because of how much money is involved but also because of the message of united action that it sends out. Monetary policy cannot be the only European policy being used to counteract the impact of the pandemic on European economies. An agreement would send a message that there is political will to do so among all countries. The proposed plan will be linked to the European Semester, which coordinates economic and budgetary policies within the EU. The Commission has initially given carte blanche for fiscal policy action in the short term, but it will ensure that public finances are brought back onto a sustainable path over the medium term.[end_answer] At the ECB we are constantly in touch with the national central banks. The Banco de España’s projections are in line with what we have published for the euro area as a whole. There are signs that economic activity is picking up as countries are reopening their economies and lifting restrictions on movement, lockdown measures and the like. What’s key is knowing how quickly countries will be able to recover what was lost during the four months from March to June. And for that recovery to take place as soon as possible, every country must ensure the survival of most of the businesses that were active before the crisis.[end_answer] I’m not going to comment on specific countries. Generally speaking, every country should have loan guarantees, support measures such as tax moratoria, the possibility of postponing social security contributions during this period, and temporary employment schemes like the ERTE. All of these measures will lead to a very significant increase in the public deficit and fiscal policy planning will be needed to address this expenditure. After all the fiscal efforts required right now, once the pandemic is over, countries will of course be left with something they won’t be able to avoid: a very significant increase in the government debt-to-GDP ratio. On average, the debt-to-GDP ratio for the euro area as a whole could increase by between 15 and 20 percentage points. This situation is the result of an expansionary fiscal policy required to tackle the pandemic, and it will have to be addressed in the future so that the public deficit can return to a path that is considered to be sustainable over the medium term.[end_answer] It will depend on each country. But every euro area country will have to deal with this new economic situation after heavy public spending programmes and a significant dip in tax revenues. This will lead to a larger hole in the public finances which will have to be covered by government debt. The ECB’s debt purchases are preventing a fragmentation of bond markets and a tightening of financial conditions, which is greatly helping all countries prevent the health and economic crisis from being exacerbated by a debt crisis.[end_answer] Once we see a return to growth, countries will have to address the situation by reducing this extraordinary spending and recovering tax revenues. This will be an individual task for each country. But it will be of vital importance and, as the Governor of the Banco de España said, it will require a fiscal consolidation plan lasting several years.[end_answer] I am personally in favour of a temporary emergency minimum income for those hardest hit by the crisis. This has been done in a structural way in Spain. It is a legitimate social policy decision which, as ECB Vice-President, I am not going to comment on. Generally speaking, it’s important that these kinds of support measures don’t discourage people from seeking employment and that they are funded in a sustainable manner over the medium term. And, in any case, job creation is without a doubt the best social policy to tackle poverty and emerge from this crisis.[end_answer] When you look at the action plans of each Member State, their basic principles are all very similar. There are three key courses of action. The first is government guarantees so that the banks will grant loans. The second is moratoria on tax payments, social security contributions and the like. And the third is temporary employment schemes, such as the ERTE.[end_answer] But not all countries have the same fiscal capacity. Those countries with less debt and lower deficits have been able to embark on more ambitious programmes. And this is precisely why a pan-European response is essential. We have to avoid a situation in which some countries are left behind in the recovery because they had less fiscal space to address the public health crisis and the ensuing economic crisis.[end_answer] The ERTE scheme also helps businesses. It was reformed in 2012 and is proving to be extremely useful. The government pays part of the wages and social security contributions, which helps businesses and means that, in the event of a downturn, they don’t have to make redundancies.[end_answer] That is a decision for the unions, employers and the government. A major advantage of the ERTE is that it limits companies’ expenditure but it also has a budgetary cost, which is why it is a decision that must be taken by the government in conjunction with labour and management stakeholders.[end_answer] I am not going to get into assessing the performance of any government. Member States will have to submit their programmes and action plans for reforms, investment, etc. to the European Commission, and it will be up to the Commission to evaluate those plans, not me.[end_answer] As a result of the pandemic, the Commission has waived the application of State aid rules. But some countries are in a better position than others to inject funds, and fragmentation of the Single Market must be avoided. That’s why it’s essential to restore the core principles for granting aid. We are currently experiencing an exceptional situation but we must not let it become structural. As things gradually get back to normal, State aid must once again be governed by the principles of free competition and preservation of the Single Market. These common rules must be restored as soon as possible, and I am sure that they will be.[end_answer] The current recession is even worse than the one that occurred between 2009 and 2013. It is the worst on record since the Civil War. It will affect public finances; there will be a drop in incomes, and more poverty. Measures will have to be taken on many economic and social fronts which will require consensus at the highest level. In this respect, it is obviously much better to have a coordinated approach between the government and the main opposition parties. The recovery plan will be very complex, it will have to deal with many different variables, and reaching a consensus will obviously be vital. That would require leaving dogmatic approaches to one side, a great deal of transparency, a great deal of commitment, and the willingness of politicians to achieve that consensus. Clearly, for the future of the Spanish economy, reaching a consensus on the recovery plan will be vital.[end_answer] Europe’s banking sector has more capital and is much more resilient than it was ten years ago. It is therefore in a much better position to face the crisis. Its main problem is low profitability. Profit levels were already low before the crisis, and have fallen even further, and this can be seen from banks’ stock market valuations; currently banks are priced at 70% below their book value on average. In some cases, the figure is even higher, at 80% or 90%. The crisis will put more pressure on profitability. Consequently, what was essential before the crisis will now be even more so, including the need to reduce cost/income ratios or to proceed with consolidation or restructuring processes. We also have to keep in mind that a bank’s solvency is not measured by its capital ratio alone, but by other variables, such as the level of provisions or the efficiency of the system. In the last ten years, the Spanish banking sector has undergone an intensive clean-up and consolidation process, which is why it is currently not giving cause for concern.[end_answer] The ECB does not shape the market. Profitability was low before the crisis and will be further affected by it. Provisions will increase, there will be a rise in the number of defaults and non-performing loans, and this will affect the profit and loss account, further reducing the bottom line. Faced with this situation, banks will have to react. The ECB believes that consolidation could help to reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of certain banks, but it’s not the supervisor’s role to say what form specific operations should take. ECB Banking Supervision has taken steps, such as requesting the suspension of dividend payments, so that banks use their funds to maintain lending volumes and don’t make the recession worse.[end_answer] The ECB Supervisory Board will reassess the situation. At the moment, the recommendation is to suspend dividend payments until at least October, and a decision will be taken before then about a possible extension. The aim is to use the funds that would have been distributed as dividends to grant loans in order to help the recovery and help banks maintain their own solvency levels. It is a recommendation, and as such is not mandatory. But like all the other supervisory recommendations made, the banks pay a great deal of attention to them.[end_answer] Bad banks have been created in some countries. “Sareb” was created in Spain, and it has been a very efficient tool for cleaning up the sector. But the ECB has not taken any decision or entered into any detail about the possibility of creating a bad bank at the European level. It is too early for this discussion at the moment.[end_answer] We must strike a balance between health and the economy. For countries like Spain, where tourism plays a crucial role, opening up the borders helps with exiting the crisis and making progress on the recovery front. It is a vital step to help reboot the economy with as much force as possible and offset some of the contraction seen over the last four months. It is therefore important, but health must always be taken into account and we must be on our guard to ensure the epidemic is kept under control.[end_answer] Spanish labour market reforms have played a vital role in creating employment in the country since 2012. What’s more, the ERTE for example, provides clear evidence of how the tools that were improved as part of these reforms are helping substantially. To face the major crisis triggered by this global pandemic, it is important to provide certainty and be predictable.[end_answer] That was almost two-and-a-half years ago. I decided to leave the ministry because the ECB is a wonderful place to work. I was a minister for six-and-a-half years, in fairly tricky economic circumstances. But numerous economic and financial reforms were introduced that laid the foundations for the recovery. From a professional viewpoint, it was excellent, in spite of the difficulties, and I am also very satisfied from a personal viewpoint. And now I’m delighted to be at the ECB.[end_answer] I don’t know who will go for this position, but, generally speaking, I will always be in favour of having Spanish representatives in important positions in international organisations, because it shows that the country can have an influence.[end_answer] Spain asked for a bank rescue package in 2012 of up to €100 billion, of which €40 billion was used. This loan from the European Stability Mechanism was essential to clean up the financial system which, at the end of the day, enabled the economy to grow. It is up to the government to review the situation and decide if it must take that decision.[end_answer] The crisis triggered by this public health emergency requires governments throughout the euro area to make a fiscal effort, which will lead to bigger deficits and higher debt levels. By purchasing assets, the ECB is avoiding fragmentation and enabling governments to obtain financing on the market. It is also essential to have a pan-European response to this problem to ensure that all countries can get back on the path to economic recovery. Once this has been achieved, governments will have to adopt measures to ensure that their public finances are sustainable in the medium term.","['inflation expectations, which are now lower',

357,2020-06-05,"Interview with Radio anch’io, Rai Radio 1",Fabio Panetta,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in200605_1~5721fc5275.en.html,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Giorgio Zanchini on 5 June 2020","My first question is partly taken from the front page of Corriere della Sera, and that is: is the ECB worried about recession, and is that what triggered yesterday’s decision?[end_question] Mr Panetta, what are the projections for the euro area for the next two years?[end_question] And what about Italy, Mr Panetta?[end_question] One last question: this is an excellent parachute – I’m using a term from one of today’s newspapers – for our public debt, among other things, sales of bonds have been excellent. Some are now asking whether all the instruments being made available by the European authorities – and I’ll try to list the main ones without making a mistake: the SURE programme, the EIB, the Recovery Fund – are they not making the ESM, for example, useless? I understand that it’s not your role to answer. But do we really need all of these financing measures if in reality there is this safety net, this parachute of yours?[end_question] So, you detect a note of relative optimism?[end_question] Disclaimer","Yesterday’s decision was triggered by the tensions that we are experiencing in the euro area economy. At yesterday’s meeting, we discussed the new projections for growth and inflation. We have seen that the prolonged lockdown of economic activity has hit many euro area countries very hard and has caused deflationary pressures to resurface. Inflation is very low and is expected to remain so over the entire horizon covered by our projections (that is, the next two years). We acted in accordance with the ECB’s mandate to ensure price stability at the European level, and expanded our programme for purchasing securities.[end_answer] Every three months, the ECB publishes its projections for growth and inflation in the euro area over the following two years. Yesterday we published the projections for June and, as was to be expected, they were much worse than the previous set of projections. The outlook for growth for this year, 2020, has fallen by almost 10 percentage points, which is huge. Before the pandemic, growth was projected to be just below 1%, and now we are looking at a contraction of more than 8.5%. So, this difference between 1% in the pre-crisis projections and a recession of around 8.5% – that’s the effect of the pandemic, that’s the coronavirus effect. We expect to see an improvement in 2021 and 2022, but this will only go some way towards mitigating the effects; it will not make up for all of the fall in economic activity this year.[end_answer] We don’t publish projections for individual countries, but Italy will clearly follow a similar path. The Governor of the Banca d’Italia gave some data in his recent Concluding Remarks. According to the latest estimates, the Italian economy is expected to contract by between 9% and 13%. Of course, these estimates are surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, because economic developments in the coming months will probably not be dictated by the laws of economics, but very probably by variables that are much less well known. Will there be a new wave of infections? Will there be a vaccine? Will there need to be another lockdown phase or social distancing measures? We don’t have the answers to these questions, and there is clearly a very close relationship between the measures to contain the pandemic and economic developments. However, the Italian economy will follow a similar path to that of the European economy, with a very strong fall in economic activity this year and partial recovery in the following years.[end_answer] Well, the market conditions we observe depend on the information investors have at their disposal. Investors know that this is a very large purchase programme implemented by the ECB to finance the economy, keep a lid on borrowing costs and provide liquidity. They also know that these are measures that have been taken and that others are being discussed by the European authorities. It would be a mistake for people to believe – after the fact, and seeing that conditions are relatively positive and calm – that this situation is entirely unrelated to the steps that have been taken beforehand. What we see on the markets, the degree of optimism – or reduced pessimism – and the greater sense of calm that is a result of all the decisions taken by national and European authorities. It would be wrong to think that these measures are useless.[end_answer] Compared to a few weeks ago, there is no doubt about it. It has become clear that, first of all, the ECB will take action, it will do so in a decisive way, and it will not allow a tightening of financial conditions to further weigh on the euro area economy. Second, even though the situation has been somewhat challenging at times, it has become clear that the authorities at European and national level are taking action.

373,2020-03-21,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung,Isabel Schnabel,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in200321~e8725acf2f.en.html,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Bernau and Dennis Kremer","Ms Schnabel, never before has the ECB provided so much money for asset purchases in such a short period of time. Is this crisis worse than anything we’ve seen before?[end_question] Where do you see the biggest problems?[end_question] If the ECB buys sovereign bonds, governments will be able to borrow money more easily and pass it on to firms. Is that still in line with your mandate?[end_question] So it’s not a rescue plan for Italy?[end_question] …meaning that investors start selling, government bonds fall in value, and so even more investors have to sell…[end_question] One week ago, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the ECB isn’t responsible for closing risk premia on government bonds. Did that create additional uncertainty?[end_question] Are there any rules at all now for such asset purchases, or does the ECB just do what it likes?[end_question] Would you have liked to go into this crisis with higher interest rates, so that you could cut rates now?[end_question] Some people are already calling for signals to hike interest rates once the crisis is over.[end_question] The authors of that piece were talking about the period after the crisis.[end_question] Yes, but one does get the impression that every crisis sees the introduction of new measures which then can’t really be unwound afterwards, and then central banks have to come up with something bigger and better in the next crisis. Is that the right way forward?[end_question] The banks are also a cause for concern. Do they have enough capital to survive this crisis?[end_question] But is that enough in the face of the current shock?[end_question] How long can the economy withstand such a situation?[end_question] Would the ECB then be able to do even more? Or has it completely exhausted its scope for action?[end_question] So you really want to buy even more bonds? What effects do you envisage?[end_question] The German Constitutional Court might put a spanner in the works when it rules on the legality of the bond purchases in May.[end_question] Would it help if crisis bonds, jointly issued by the euro area countries, were now available?[end_question] What should they do?[end_question] How many people are still working in the ECB tower?[end_question] Disclaimer","It’s an extraordinary crisis. It’s not just Europe that is affected, it’s the whole world. And in addition to the health problems and the human suffering, we’re also experiencing a severe economic shock that is being compounded by the protective measures taken. Our new asset purchase programme, which has been put in place specifically for this pandemic emergency, aims to address the particular nature of the situation we are facing.[end_answer] The crisis is affecting supply and demand at the same time. Initially, the focus was mainly on disrupted supply chains. Now the protective measures taken are also hampering production in many companies. And demand is falling too – if people don’t know what the future will bring, they hold on to their money, especially since many activities have been curtailed. Companies are investing less. And all that means that we are already facing a massive shock; we need to make sure that it doesn’t get even worse.[end_answer] Our actions are always determined by our mandate of price stability. And for this we need a functioning transmission mechanism so that monetary policy is passed on to the real economy. That mechanism had recently become impaired, as manifested by the sudden rise in euro area government bond yields. It was affecting all euro area countries, even Germany. When that happens, monetary policy has to step in.[end_answer] No, of course not. And Italy has not lost its market access. The concern was rather that we could start to see self-reinforcing price spirals…[end_answer] …which can always happen in times of crisis, especially when capital is seeking safe havens. The central bank must act to counter such effects when the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is at risk.[end_answer] The markets were questioning whether the ECB continued to stand ready to do everything necessary to stabilise the situation. But that was never in any doubt. And then the situation in the markets deteriorated rapidly, so we had to take further action.[end_answer] Our purchase programmes are rules-based. We continue in principle to buy bonds in line with the capital share of each country. But we need more flexibility now, over time as well as across countries and asset classes, in order to tackle the situation appropriately.[end_answer] Interest rates have been set appropriately also in recent years. Higher interest rates were not an option – otherwise we wouldn’t have been able to fulfil our price stability mandate and we would have damaged the economy. I know very few economists who are of a different view.[end_answer] Your newspaper featured a guest commentary last week on the subject. In view of the current situation, that article seems a little out of place. We are looking at what might well be one of the worst economic crises of all time. It seems inappropriate to be talking about raising interest rates now.[end_answer] We should talk about what happens after the crisis at a later date. For now we need to concentrate on mitigating the effects of this crisis.[end_answer] The new package is proportionate to the situation. It will only run until we have overcome this crisis. Your question also seems to suggest that we need to return to the former style of monetary policy, that is before the ECB began to purchase bonds. But that is not necessarily the case. There are long-term trends that have resulted in very low real interest rates. Among other things, these trends reflect demographic ageing and declining productivity gains. A central bank cannot counter that.[end_answer] It is imperative to prevent the crisis from spreading to the banking sector. That’s why measures targeting liquidity bottlenecks in firms are especially effective; they work by warding off high levels of loan defaults at banks. We should be glad that the banks’ capital requirements were significantly increased over the past few years. All in all, the banks are currently much better prepared for a crisis than they were before the financial crisis of 2008.[end_answer] We are indeed living through a scenario that no one could have imagined. It was therefore never assessed in a stress test – we are unfortunately experiencing it now in real time. If widespread insolvencies occured among borrowers, the banking sector would also be affected. But in many cases, the issue in the first instance is a liquidity bottleneck. That’s something politicians can deal with. The decisive factor is how long the crisis persists.[end_answer] It depends on how severe the restrictions are and on how well-placed firms are to adjust to them. In some sectors, this is relatively unproblematic; in others, for example catering, it’s hardly feasible. At some point, this situation will presumably become unsustainable, prompting the question as to what role the state intends to play in supporting firms.[end_answer] The ECB is in the comfortable position of having a large set of tools, none of which has been used to its full extent. We stand ready to take further measures if needed to fulfil our mandate. This was decided by the ECB’s Governing Council.[end_answer] We have a wide range of instruments: we have the key interest rates, we have instruments for providing liquidity to the banks and we have the asset purchase programmes. All of these instruments can be used to improve financing conditions. That is immensely important during such a crisis. The claim that central banks have run out of tools simply doesn’t match up to the facts.[end_answer] Against this backdrop, it’s important that our measures are proportionate. Given the severity of this crisis and the threat of massive economic damage, our monetary policy decisions are in my view appropriate. By the way, the Court’s judgement relates to the existing asset purchase programmes the rules of which we have basically left unchanged.[end_answer] That could help. The success of our measures hinges on what happens on the fiscal policy side. We can’t resolve the situation by ourselves. Much has already been done at the national level, also in Germany. But it is ultimately a European problem. No country can be indifferent to what is going on in another European country – not only for the sake of solidarity, but also for economic reasons. I hope that this is understood by the politicians.[end_answer] There are proposals to use the European Stability Mechanism or the European Investment Bank. The issuance of one-off “corona bonds” would also be conceivable. It is up to politicians to decide.[end_answer] Only a handful of people are still on site. Almost everything is taking place remotely, even the meetings of the ECB’s Executive Board.

380,2020-02-14,Interview with RTÉ (Ireland’s National Television and Radio Broadcaster),Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2020/html/ecb.in200214~f13ad74497.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Robert Shortt on 13 February 2020 and broadcast (in part) on 13 February 2020","There has been some criticism of ECB policy when it comes to quantitative easing and negative interest rates. Some people have described it as an experiment in monetary policy. There’s been this assertion that interest rates are no longer an effective tool for stimulating economic activity. People have painted the scenario of the Japanification of the eurozone economy. What’s your response to all of that?[end_question] What would you say to the criticism – and it’s been quite loud in some eurozone countries – that the ECB has been deaf to some of the side effects of its policies, say, in particular towards savers and pensioners?[end_question] Some have said that the continued low interest rates and quantitative easing have had benefits for large investment funds, and for the area of property investments in particular these benefits come at the expense of individual prospective house buyers, or indeed people who end up renting. It’s become an issue here as it has in other parts of Europe. How would you respond to that?[end_question] Some would say that part of the answer would be to cap particularly retail interest rates charged by banks. Do you see that as part of the answer?[end_question] You don’t even see a role for it, say, if you were to consider the housing situation to be an emergency scenario; that it would be a temporary measure given to the central bank?[end_question] We’ve just had an election. We probably won’t have a government for some time. What economic advice would you give to any incoming government?[end_question] Is the Irish economy one of those countries that has more room to stimulate economic activity?[end_question] You’re nine months into the job: what do you think the advantages are for Ireland of having the former Governor of the central bank here in such a key role at the ECB?[end_question] One of the things we’ve been very worried about here for quite some time is Brexit. What concerns would you have? What concerns at a European level, at the ECB level, are there about Brexit?[end_question] Final question, just on a personal level: how are you finding the new job? Are you enjoying it? Is it everything you thought it would be? What’s Frankfurt like?[end_question] Disclaimer","We don’t agree with that analysis. If you go back to 2014, which is when this policy started, since then ECB monetary policy has been very effective. We have seen very low interest rates for firms and households. We have seen a big increase in employment in the euro area economy. And we do see inflation moving upwards. Without these policies these disinflationary pressures would be more severe. We would not only have lower inflation: we could even have the risk of deflation. And without these policies the recovery in Europe we have seen in the last five or six years would not be so far advanced. So we think ECB policy is still effective. Going back to your question about Japan, all of this is very much with the intent of avoiding the situation of deflation that Japan had from the mid-1990s to about 2013. That was a very costly episode to have and we are intent on making sure inflation goes back to target in order to avoid that situation.[end_answer] At any time when the interest rate goes down, it clearly has a different effect on those who have a mortgage and those who have a lot of debt -- governments and corporates -- than it does on those households that are maybe saving for retirement, those who are accumulating funds and pension funds. That has always been true. Monetary policy has different effects on savers and debtors. What is true at the moment is that this episode has been going on for years now. We have had very low interest rates for a long time and that does have implications for the financial system and for these groups. Going back to the previous question, if we did not pursue these policies then the medium-term scenario would be worse. If inflation gets worse, if it gets lower, if it gets locked in at a low rate, then the prospects for interest rates recovering in the future would be less.[end_answer] A temporary phase, which we are in, of low interest rates makes it more likely that we will return to a situation where savers get a better deal. It is a temporary phase, but there is no doubt that there are consequences for those looking to earn income. This is not a situation that is ideal. But we are still in the legacy of the crisis and I think this policy path is correct. We also always say that, in terms of the speed of the recovery, European fiscal policymakers can do more. Those countries which have fiscal space can do more to accelerate the recovery.[end_answer] The low interest rate environment has many benefits. It helps to create jobs. For those with a mortgage, it reduces the cost of maintaining that mortgage. For highly indebted governments there is a saving in terms of debt service payments. But there is no doubt about it: it does mean that it raises the purchase price of homes. It raises the purchase price of commercial property, so those, as you say, with a lot of financial firepower, global institutional investors and so on, will find it easier to deal with that. And as you say, there are knock-on effects in the rental market, absolutely. We have a strategy review this year, where I think we have always been alive to these concerns. Revisiting how we think about housing in how we do monetary policy is part of that review. For monetary policy, if it has these consequences, we need what we call macroprudential policy to go hand-in-hand.[end_answer] So here in Ireland, as you know, the Central Bank of Ireland has mortgage rules, and it is a very difficult situation. If someone says that in order to allow the individual to compete with the global investors, maybe they should be able to borrow more money: I don’t really think that’s part of the answer. We tried that before here, and we need to keep a limit on the amount of debt that households take on. Because the cost of excessive debt is so high, as we know in this country. Going back, how we deal with improving affordable housing, all of these are frontline political issues, that is true across Europe in different ways. For a fast-growing economy like Ireland, where the workforce is growing, where there is so much pressure on housing, it’s obviously quite intense. But we don’t think tighter monetary policy from us is part of the answer.[end_answer] This is a long-running debate here. Even though the ECB rate is quite low, when you look across Europe, the mortgage lending rates in Ireland are higher. The ECB has provided a legal opinion on the draft law, and it highlights, in line with the Central Bank of Ireland analysis, that a policy that caps the interest rate runs the risk of having an unintended effect, which is that it will deter entry. The Irish banking system is quite concentrated. Many people would like to see more banks enter to compete and, through competition, lower the rates. If you have a legal approach, where there is a legal regulation capping the interest rate, then the incentive for foreign lenders to come in is less. We have this long-running debate about the contribution of the quite high default risk in Ireland being built into those higher rates. I understand the intent: trying to make housing more affordable is a big issue. But personally, and in terms of the official advice of the ECB, we think capping interest rates is not the advisable way to go.[end_answer] Well, again let me come back to the basics here. So much of the funding now in the Irish property market is not coming from mortgages. You give the example of global institutional investors. What is driving the overall pricing of housing, also rental accommodation and so on, is not the mortgage situation in Ireland. Those global factors will be there no matter what happens to these mortgage rates in Ireland. It’s a very important issue for the individual in terms of coping with the mortgage they face. But in terms of saying this will somehow contribute to a repricing of the value of property, I don’t think that’s how it will work.[end_answer] Every six weeks when we make our monetary policy statement, the last part of our statement essentially gives the list of our advice. One thing is that we do think the European economy will be better off the more governments do to improve the functioning of the economy. There is a long list of recommendations, called the country-specific recommendations that the European Commission offers to the member countries. Ireland has a long list in terms of improving infrastructure, productivity, etc. There are many dimensions to it, but I think everyone can identify the same list. We also say that those countries with a strong enough fiscal position can do more to raise the level of economic activity in the euro area. But we also say that those countries with high levels of public debt, and less robust public finances, need to make sure their fiscal position is prudent.[end_answer] What I have just said there doesn’t boil down to any fixed set of demands. In the end, the decisions of government are correctly left with the political system. But in terms of some core principles, it’s to balance prudence in managing the public finances and to make sure that the government policies are promoting sustainable growth: sustainable, long-term, climate-conscious, consistent with the carbon transition, consistent with raising productivity. If you read the manifestos of all the parties, they all have different ideas, but I think all share the same principle, which is: the more we can have a sustainable economy that is delivering employment and so on, the better for the future of the Irish economy.[end_answer] Well, as you know, this is a long-running debate. At one level, there has been a lot of progress. All of these difficult years of austerity have led to a big improvement in public finances and the number one uncertainty is about the future of corporation tax revenue, which has been unexpectedly high. When I was at the Central Bank of Ireland, and where I am now, we would still have the same concern, which is: where do you strike a balance between recognising that this is an important source of revenue versus whether it is guaranteed to be here into the future. For any incoming government, having a prudent approach to managing that would be important.[end_answer] What’s very interesting about the ECB is that our only focus is on the overall performance of the euro area. The euro area is a very important trade partner for Ireland. What is good for the wider euro area would typically be good for Ireland. What I can say more generally is that the ECB has staff from everywhere in the EU. It’s very interesting to have that diversity. We talked earlier on about savers versus debtors. That’s important because that differs across the euro area. Some countries have big manufacturing sectors. Other countries are more focused on tourism or technology. It differs so much that having staff -- and, if you like, the Executive Board membership -- that reflects the diversity of the euro area makes for a very interesting workplace and I think makes for better-quality policymaking.[end_answer] Let me make three points on this. One is, as I think it’s well understood here: we’re in a pause. Brexit has happened, but until we know what the new trade deal is going to be, the uncertainty remains. The more quickly a trade deal is concluded the better, because we do think uncertainty in general is holding back the European economy.[end_answer] A second point to make is trade frictions: the more severe the trade frictions, the worse we think the medium-term performance of the UK and European economies will be. But taking the overall European view: the United Kingdom is not big enough. It’s a big country, but compared with the EU27 it is not big enough to be the driving force for the future of the euro area. Of course, it’s more important for us (in Ireland), as it’s the closest neighbour. But for the euro area, while it’s an important concern, compared with global trade and the future of, say, China and the emerging economies, this is a medium-priority topic.[end_answer] The last point is that, in terms of the financial system, it’s very important that we have good supervisory relationships with the Bank of England and the other supervisors in the United Kingdom. So even though the trade deal focuses on trading goods and services, we also have an agenda to make sure we can work together post-Brexit in terms of supervising the euro area financial system and the UK financial system.[end_answer] Let me say two things. One is that of course I very much miss working at the Central Bank of Ireland, which is a great institution. But as an economist, leading the economics work of the ECB is a tremendous personal challenge and tremendously fulfilling. I can tell you that residentially, Frankfurt as a city is fantastic to spend time in. They may have historically a reputation of being a bit quiet, but I think anyone who spends time there is pleased with it. It is a really nice city to visit.","['inflation moving upwards', 'disinflationary pressures', 'lower inflation', 'inflation goes back', 'inflation gets worse']","['And we do see inflation moving

She's Christine Lagarde. Madame Lagarde, thank you so much for giving us a little bit of your busy schedule. When you look at the strategy review event, you really laid out what you were trying to achieve yesterday in the press conference. At this moment, what do you see as the biggest challenge for it?[end_question] You said that you have a preference on how you would look at inflation, but you wouldn't say why.[end_question] Is it about the consensus building, or is it just about not influencing?[end_question] Can you give us, then, a sense of the future timetable for these reviews? Should it be a regular thing?[end_question] Markets are interpreting the exercise as maybe having a little bit of a dovish tilt. Then you look at housing costs and you look maybe at side effects of negative rates…[end_question] You're an owl.[end_question] But what signs should markets be looking at in the review to give us a sense of where it goes?[end_question] Is it also a warning to the markets not to over interpret too quickly?[end_question] Economists believe that monetary policy at the ECB will be largely on autopilot for the next two years: is that a mistake?[end_question] Yesterday you talked quite extensively about negative rates; you said tiering is working well, but is there a point where actually the side effects of negative rates mean that you need to scale it back?[end_question] Which means what, that you could extend tiering?[end_question] President Trump left Davos saying that actually he's still thinking about possible tariffs against Germany and Europe in general. You're seeing growth in Europe; how do you match up the two?[end_question] Are tariffs the biggest concern you see for the European economy?[end_question] You've done a number of public events in the last couple of weeks. What concerns have people raised with you?[end_question] Is it reconnecting with the citizens?[end_question] A lot of the focus here is on sustainability. You talked about sustainability.[end_question] Is there a danger that we have outsized expectations about what central banks can do to tackle this?[end_question] Do you worry that the more questions you ask…[end_question] Like what? If you force, for example, financial institutions or ask for them to stress test climate change, how much complexity does that actually. How much cost does it involve and how many more complex issues come up to the surface because of the exercise?[end_question] Do chief executives and governments take it seriously, or is there a danger that they come to Davos, and talk about it…[end_question] If you see a recession or if you see it tilted downwards for the economy, is there a danger that actually all of this goodwill goes out the window?[end_question] What is the one thing that you would ask of the European Commission when it comes to tackling climate change right now? Do we need a common definition? Is it carbon pricing?[end_question] Is this one issue you think Europe can speak with a common voice on?[end_question] But is this one thing that will deliver the real fiscal spending that you and your predecessor have been asking for, for a long time?[end_question] Christine Lagarde, I know you have to go, so a final question: if you look at the central bank stance around the world, there is a lot of talk that central banks are coming to the end of the tools that they have. Can somehow fiscal spending across the world make up for that?[end_question] If you look at how markets have reacted, do you worry that they're out of kilter actually, so markets are going up and the world economy is in a little bit of a standstill?[end_question] Is that because they don't price risk?[end_question] Christine Lagarde, thank you so much for joining us.[end_question] Disclaimer","24 January 2020[end_answer] The biggest challenge is going to be to harness all the views, all the assessments, all the convictions into a direction that will actually serve the purpose that we have been assigned, which is guaranteed price stability in the economy. Now, that seems like a very dry proposal but the whole point is to actually create the ground, maintain the ground and fertilise the ground – so that there is growth, so that there are jobs, and so that the economies of the euro area are working well and hopefully are generating some good value for the citizens of the euro area. That's the purpose.[end_answer] Now, I have a preference on many topics. I have views and I'm not an idiot. Yes, I do have views in relation to how we can procure this price stability, how financial stability has to be taken into account, how we take into account the risks of climate change and the impact that it has on many aspects of the work that we've been doing. I do have those views, and all the people around the table have those views. I think my job as President is to facilitate the expression, the rallying of views around various themes, one of which will be the inflation objective-setting, if you will – which may take multiple forms – but which is one of the anchors that will determine our discussions. But I don't think that a President right from the get-go, as we are just about to embark on the process, should state; this is my view. I don't want to preclude others from expressing theirs and I don't want to over-influence the debate.[end_answer] Lagarde: It's a combination of both. There are very strong members around the table and I don't think that they will be under any kind of influence other than reviewing the facts, understanding the reactions, understanding the response, understanding the effectiveness of what we can do. The world has changed so dramatically over the last 20… you know, last time we had a strategy review was in 2003. The growth was much higher in those days, inflation was higher, the prospects for the various demographics around the world were different. The world has massively changed. We didn't use social media as much as we do; we hardly had the cell phone in those days.[end_answer] That's to be debated. First of all, the initial timetable that we are setting for ourselves – which is ambitious, I acknowledge that – is to try to conclude before the end of this year. So December 2020, hopefully, we will have reached that platform of consensus on the various topics that we have. Now, do we have to repeat the exercise every five years, every eight years, every 16 years, as we have? I have my views as well and we will debate that with the group to see how necessary it is, how helpful it can be.[end_answer] I'm an owl; I'm not a dove, I'm not a hawk![end_answer] There are doves and hawks around the table, I get it![end_answer] If markets are interested in what happens in the next 12 months, they should not pay too much attention to the strategy review because we're conducting two separate exercises here. We will have our monetary policy assessment and review as usual. Every six weeks we all get together, we look at the numbers, we look at the markets, we look at the views of the citizens in terms of inflation expectations. We decide whether things should be status quo or whether they should vary one way or the other. That exercise will be conducted irrespective of the strategy review, so to those who say, “Oh, it's going to be completely static and stable for 12 months”, I'd say, watch out! Because things change and we might have different signals and we might reconsider. We might. I don't know at this point in time. What I know for sure is that there will be two different exercises and the strategy review will be on its own, on a standalone basis, and will progress. We are looking at what we do in the future, not what we do next week, or in May or in July.[end_answer] They always over interpret. They're going to look at my face and see, well, is she smiling? Is she “dovish”? Is she hawkish? I told them on day one: I said, “Don't over interpret. We will say what we can say.” I know that some people are disappointed that we didn’t say much more yesterday, but a strategy review starts here, finishes there. You cannot here say what you are going to do there; otherwise you don't do a strategy review. We need to do a lot of stock-taking, looking at the effectiveness of what we have done, learning from other countries around the world as well in the process. You know that the Fed is undergoing the same exercise, and we need to take time to reach out to the Parliament, to academics, to people, to those who are interested in these issues to hear the voices, to understand what their views are. We will listen to markets as well, but they are one of the voices that we will listen to.[end_answer] No, I just told you – as to those who think that it's on autopilot, I think that's ridiculous. There is forward guidance which is strong, which is setting a very clear timetable that is fact-dependent. But let's look at the facts, let's look at how the economy evolves. That's what we do; we need to be fact-driven, we need to be clear in our communication and we will be. I'm saying today: don't assume that it will be on autopilot.[end_answer] We will be looking at the side effects as part of the strategy review. There is no question about that. We need to be attentive to that. Financial stability is not our first driver of concern and consideration, but we will have to look at it, of course, yes. Don't forget that we need to have a banking sector in the euro area that acts as a good channel of transmission.[end_answer] Multiple responses! As I said yesterday, we are not considering that at the moment.[end_answer] We're saying modest growth in Europe. We're saying a bit more modest downside risks as well, so that's probably the reason why it's kind of slightly balanced to the upside, but very slightly. We shall see. What I was pleased about is to see that there had been a good first meeting between Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and President Trump. It's better to start off on a good footing and there will be difficult relationships going forward, and points of negotiation that will be hard. Whether it's trade, whether it's tax, whether it's technology, whether it's energy – there are multiple topics. As Ursula said, Europe and the United States have been friends for a long, long time. It will not go away and in many instances, they have joint interests but Europe is different. Europe operates on different values, with different systems, and that needs to be secured and preserved for the sake of the Europeans.[end_answer] It's a big concern, let's face it. Don't forget that there is trade intra-Europe and that would not indeed be affected. But trade with the United States, which is an important trade partner, would be affected if there was a sudden rise in tariffs, yes – or a tariff war. Tit for tat, you tariff me, I'll tariff you: that's going to operate as a brake on the economy, for sure.[end_answer] You know, it varies. When I talk to family members, they say, “Explain what you do, Mum, please? We don't really understand!” That's a really good signal for me that we need to communicate in a more explicit way about what we procure. If we explain exactly what we do, it's technically sound – the experts will understand. Family members and the taxi drivers, the hairdressers and the shopkeepers are not going to understand. If we explain that what we do actually procures growth, facilitates investment and creates jobs, then it means something. But we should not be the only one to try to do that![end_answer] I think that's an important factor, yes, because people of Europe – particularly the euro area – are quite bullish about the euro. They are pleased to have the euro as their currency. And we do everything we can to make sure that euros can flow easily, that payments are secure, that what they have is solid, is stability. But I think we need to do a bit more.[end_answer] Yes.[end_answer] Possibly, but I think that nonetheless, each and every one of us has to explore what he or she can do about the current risks. I think that it has been under… The risks caused by climate change to corporates, to the economy, to general stability have been largely underestimated – and for good reasons, because many risks are difficult to assess. We are talking about what happens in 30 years. It's not on the cards of a stress tester to anticipate what happens in 30 years. You look at the immediate future, you look at the market risks, you look at macro risks. But the climate risks in 30 years, that need action now if we want to remedy those risks, that's difficult – but we need to do it, absolutely.[end_answer] Lagarde: And by the way, central bankers can do quite a bit.[end_answer] I say never mind the cost; beware of the accident, number one, so even if it costs something, the risk that it protects us against is so much bigger that it's really worth a bit of investment. And it's also a source of economic opportunities, let's not forget that. That's where everybody has to rally at the table because it requires good and probably different accounting principles. I'm delighted that the big accounting firms are taking this seriously, and I hope they deliver. It requires the regulators to be on board as well. But the policymakers, the governments have to take it seriously and not pay lip service to the risk. They have to also take the right measures, so everybody must be at the table. Central bankers will not eliminate climate risk on their own. They can participate in the process and for my money, I'll do the best I can to participate, but it's not a business of central banks.[end_answer] The governments have to take it seriously. They all signed up to the Paris Agreement. Not many countries are at the point of beginning to deliver.[end_answer] We've seen that in the past and we might see it in the future, but I think that the youth around us and public opinion will be around to remind us that this is not something that we can put on the back burner, because we have an issue.[end_answer] It's not just the European Commission; I think the European Commission is completely devoted to this. And the Green Deal, as advocated by Ursula von der Leyen, is really a good – I would say – “repurposing” of a lot of existing budgets and additional budgets and probably new financial instruments to guarantee and leverage. But it also takes the European Parliament and they are heading in the right direction, identifying a taxonomy, without which it would be difficult for others to move and say; here we need to take a provision. That collateral is not really worth what’s on the face of it.[end_answer] I would hope so. I know it's difficult. There are some countries that are still heavily coal-dependent but I would hope so. Just as Europe has moved, and is moving the world, on Data Protection, as it also has moved the world in relation to safety. Everybody complained about REACH at the time. REACH was this legislation that actually helped better regulate chemicals that could be dangerous for people. There are a lot of goods that are used on a daily basis around the world that are safer because of that Directive. So in that sense, Europe – which is often criticised for being too bureaucratic, too government-intensive – is also helping people.[end_answer] Well, I'm watching! I don't have a voice concerning fiscal policy, so to speak, but I have a voice to say; our monetary policy is much more effective if you leash out, where you have the space, on some fiscal tools as well. When I look at some countries, they are beginning to put money on the table.[end_answer] First of all, I don't think that the central banks have exhausted their tools. When conventional policy was heading towards very low rates, then new tools were invented. These were challenged but eventually they were validated. So I think that creativity also applies to central banking, number 1. Number 2, they won't be a substitute; I think it's a coordination, an amplification of one by the other.[end_answer] There are times when I think so.[end_answer] I think that some of them clearly do not price the climate change risk, for sure, yes.","['one of the anchors', 'inflation was higher']","['I think my job as President is to facilitate the expression, the rallying of views around various

388,2021-12-22,Interview with Le Monde,Isabel Schnabel,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2021/html/ecb.in211222~5f9a709924.en.html,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert on 16 December and published on 22 December","With the very rapid economic recovery on the one hand and the new wave of the pandemic on the other, the economic situation is hard to read. What’s your view?[end_question] Inflation has reached 4.9% in the euro area, 6% in Germany and over 9% in some of the Baltic countries. Are you worried?[end_question] We’ve been hearing this explanation about transitory inflation since last summer. But month after month, it always surprises on the upside…[end_question] Officially, after inflation of 3.2% in 2022, you are projecting 1.8% in 2023. Is that still credible?[end_question] And what’s the answer to that question?[end_question] Are we therefore entering a “new normal”?[end_question] Despite these uncertainties, and the risk of higher inflation, the ECB only announced a very gradual withdrawal of its asset purchases, from the current rate of €90 billion per month to €40 billion from April, then €30 billion in the third quarter of 2022 and €20 billion in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to say that this is a very accommodative stance?[end_question] Nevertheless, the ECB has been carrying out asset purchases for six years now, the interest rate is -0.5% and normalisation of monetary policy has been pushed back several times. How will you achieve it this time?[end_question] And yet, on the contrary, the impression is that the ECB has had to do more and more every time, and that its measures are less effective every time, that more billions are always needed…[end_question] In this context, is it possible to imagine a return to a “normal” monetary policy – say a 0% interest rate – during your mandate (which comes to an end in 2028)?[end_question] Disclaimer","22 December 2021[end_answer] Uncertainty is very high, as it has been throughout the pandemic. In general, I think the recovery continues. But owing to the recent wave of infections and the new variant, we are seeing headwinds in the short term. Now we’re looking at a weaker fourth quarter and this is likely to spill over to the beginning of next year. However, we expect a stronger rebound thereafter, so activity essentially shifts over time. This has been a recurring pattern during the pandemic. Households in the euro area have accumulated considerable savings, which supports the recovery. Hence, we see the recovery as being delayed rather than derailed.[end_answer] Those high numbers are related to the specific situation of the pandemic. When the economy reopened, there was a strong rebound in demand. Supply couldn’t meet that demand quickly enough, partly because of health-related restrictions. That led to numerous supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices, in particular energy prices. This has been amplified by a number of statistical effects, stemming from the fact that we’re comparing prices today with very low prices one year ago, in the middle of the pandemic, when they had collapsed. That distorts the picture somewhat.[end_answer] All those factors are likely to either reverse or at least become less pronounced over the coming year. Take supply bottlenecks: we don’t know how quickly it will happen, but it’s clear that over time they will be resolved. Similarly, it’s highly unlikely that energy prices will continue to go up at the same speed. And lastly, base effects will disappear. We know that inflation is going to be elevated for a certain period of time, but also that it’s going to decline over the course of next year. We are less certain about how fast and how strong the decline will be.[end_answer] Most economists hadn’t expected the extent of the increase in inflation. That’s why we are increasingly relying on surveys of companies and households to better understand what is happening. Some companies are telling us they expect the supply chain bottlenecks to last into 2023. We are well aware of the uncertainty around our inflation projections. There is a risk to the upside.[end_answer] Another factor that plays a central role is wage developments. Current data point to moderate growth. However, we also learned from our survey among companies that they expect wage growth to pick up. It’s something we are monitoring very closely.[end_answer] Our staff are using the best economic models available in order to make these projections. But everybody agrees that uncertainty is unusually high.[end_answer] One of the trickiest questions is whether the economy is undergoing some fundamental structural changes that are not yet reflected in the models. Are we going to go back to the disinflationary environment that we had before the pandemic? Or are we entering a new phase that may be characterised by inflationary rather than disinflationary shocks?[end_answer] Take climate change as an example. Previously, when oil prices were going up, shale oil producers quickly increased their levels of production, which put downward pressure on prices. That is not happening to the same degree now. This can probably be explained by the fact that, owing to the green transition, there is less incentive to invest in shale oil facilities. If that’s true, we are perhaps going to see stronger upward trends in oil prices in the future.[end_answer] This remains to be seen. We should follow a risk management approach so that we can quickly respond should we see signs that inflation will stay more permanently at a level above our 2% target.[end_answer] We have taken an important step towards the normalisation of our monetary policy. This has to be a gradual process – it can’t happen all at once. If we responded too quickly, there would be a risk of choking the recovery by tightening financing conditions too abruptly. We are taking a step-by-step approach to normalisation, the pace of which can be adjusted to the incoming data. We need to retain optionality to make sure that we sustainably reach our 2% target.[end_answer] The reason why our policies have been accommodative for so long is that inflation was stubbornly low. Despite all the measures we have taken, it has been hard to get medium-term inflation back towards the 2% target. Over the past year, however, we have made substantial progress, and it seems we are on the right path to achieving our target in a more sustainable manner. This is a precondition for policy normalisation.[end_answer] Because the interest rates were already very low, we had to use new tools, which have proven highly effective. But the effectiveness of some instruments diminishes over time. We have already bought a lot of bonds, and the balance of the benefits and costs of additional bond purchases deteriorates as the economy gains ground. This is why we slow down purchases now.[end_answer] But given the prevailing uncertainties, this has to be gradual, also with a view to ensuring the smooth transmission of our policy across the entire euro area.[end_answer] I hope so. The developments over the past year give reason for cautious optimism. Before the pandemic, we were in an environment of relatively low growth and too low inflation for many years. But now we are seeing that inflation is picking up and inflation expectations are realigning with our target of 2%. This is precisely what can help us get out of the low growth, low inflation environment and back to a more normal world.","['inflation is going to be elevated', 'increase in inflation', 'uncertainty

Is that an illusion or reality?[end_question] Do you recommend that banks don’t release their provisions?[end_question] You are concerned about a correction in property prices. Could we say there is a bubble?[end_question] What can you do to curb this trend?[end_question] Along with Germany and the Netherlands, France was highlighted in your financial stability review. Should France implement this measure?[end_question] Financial markets are also showing signs of exuberance. Should we be afraid of another accident like the Archegos collapse, which caused banks to lose 10 billion dollars?[end_question] Bank balance sheets have grown substantially during the crisis. This is the opposite of the “too big to fail” syndrome we wanted to combat after the financial crisis. Is this a cause for concern?[end_question] The current wave of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) will soon draw to a close. Might the ECB extend this instrument?[end_question] Does that imply that banks are still in need of support ?[end_question] The new “Omicron” variant is emerging as parts of Europe are being hit by a fifth wave of COVID-19. Does this worry you?[end_question] Turning to payments, is the European Payment Initiative important in your view?[end_question] What will the success of this project depend on?[end_question] Is it time to more strictly regulate the world of crypto-assets ?[end_question] Are big tech firms also a source of concern?[end_question] Are you still calling for banking consolidation in Europe?[end_question] You recently said that certain inflation factors in Europe were becoming more structural, and therefore permanent. What are they?[end_question] Could inflation become uncontrollable?[end_question] The markets have the impression that the next ECB meeting will signal a tightening of monetary policy. Is that the case?[end_question] And after the PEPP has ended?[end_question] Does that mean that an increase in the ECB’s key interest rates, which some market participants envisage happening by the end of 2022, isn’t a credible scenario?[end_question] Disclaimer","30 November 2021[end_answer] European banks have performed fairly well recently. Since the pandemic, profitability has increased, but the main driver of this increase is the drop in provisions. This performance is therefore based on an optimistic scenario in which the recovery continues and there is no large wave of insolvencies. However, it is good to be very cautious, because once the government support measures are withdrawn, insolvencies and non-performing loans will increase.[end_answer] It’s something that should be assessed on a bank-by-bank basis. My recommendation would be to be cautious, because we don’t know what the ultimate impact of the pandemic will be, or what effect the withdrawal of support will have. That also holds true for dividends and remuneration policies. As supervisors and given our responsibility for financial stability, our role is to call for caution.[end_answer] There is no definition of “bubble”. You know there is a bubble when it bursts. Our message is very clear: in the housing market, there are clearly pockets of overvaluation that go beyond the fundamentals. And this trend continued throughout the pandemic. Up until now, it was a localised phenomenon, but it is becoming increasingly widespread throughout the euro area. We must monitor it closely, as it comes against a backdrop of low interest rates.[end_answer] The countercyclical capital buffers were released during the public health crisis to maintain the flow of credit. Now, the macroprudential authorities in some countries should start considering the possibility of increasing them again in order to increase banks’ resilience and temper the growth in housing loans, and thereby ensure there is a soft landing if the cycle turns.[end_answer] I’m not thinking about any country in particular. But the European Systemic Risk Board will issue country-by-country recommendations in the near future.[end_answer] The environment of very low interest rates has a greater impact on the risk appetite of non-banks than it does on that of banks. And these financial intermediaries are becoming increasingly important, including in Europe. To improve the returns of their portfolios, they invest in less liquid securities, and often accumulate debt to do so. The combination of this leverage effect and less liquid securities as well as riskier assets should give us cause to be vigilant. But regulation is weaker in this sector. As for banks, their levels of capital and liquidity have increased significantly since the financial crisis. But hedge funds and other investment funds are interconnected with banks and can have a system-wide impact. Archegos could be the canary in the coal mine.[end_answer] That’s correct. There has been a strong increase in bank lending. In France, the increased indebtedness of companies was accompanied by the increased accumulation of cash. So the increase in net indebtedness is actually very limited. What is important is that bank capital ratios remained stable, and asset quality improved. That’s why I’m concentrating on provisions.[end_answer] The TLTROs are not finished yet. I think they have been a very useful instrument during the pandemic for providing short and medium-term liquidity to banks, but there is no urgency to decide on their renewal. We can wait a little longer; it’s not going to be a decision we discuss in December.[end_answer] The TLTROs are part of an emergency programme in response to the pandemic. Now that the situation is improving, the pandemic has left scars that need to be taken into consideration. Let’s not forget that TLTROs are not repaid on a fixed date but that there can be several repayment windows. So there will not be a cliff effect, and the repayment will be spread over time.[end_answer] Indeed, we have more bad news about the virus and are observing the situation of this new Omicron variant closely. The incidence rate in Germany is clearly on the rise and we have seen lockdowns reintroduced in Austria and Slovakia. It’s always unfortunate. But the situation is different from that in 2020. First and foremost, we now have vaccination. The vaccination rates in Spain and Italy, for example, are very high, in the region of 90%. Infection rates are highest in countries with lower vaccination levels of around 60-70%. Moreover, a policy of booster jabs is gaining ground, as is the requirement for a health passport. And the economic impact of a lockdown is no longer the same either, because the economy has now adapted to the situation.[end_answer] The banking union is key for establishing a truly European payment system. But it’s also essential to have a truly integrated interbank payment system, in terms of technological solutions and in terms of costs. Our approach is to support this initiative.[end_answer] Such a system would have to be customer-friendly and efficient. The system should also be completely open to other banks wishing to join the project, not only in the euro area but in Europe as a whole. Of course, it could start with a limited number of countries in the initial phase, and we hope that this initiative can expand in the future.[end_answer] The development of this market is rather impressive. I personally think that it will continue to expand rapidly. Up to now, the volatility that we have seen has not had an impact on financial stability. But at this pace of growth, we have to pay attention to it − especially in relation to issues such as terrorism financing and tax evasion. Above all, we have not yet focused enough on the combination of two risks: the acquisition of crypto-assets with leverage, in other words with debt. A market that is growing so quickly, combined with a leverage effect, generates stronger and more systemic connections with the rest of the financial system.[end_answer] Our basic principle is very simple: same activity, same regulation. If you grant loans, you should be regulated like a bank is. In terms of financial stability, however, I find these players much less worrying than the world of crypto-assets. Because the tech giants are large corporations with high market capitalisation and with a capacity for dialogue…[end_answer] I don’t think there has been cross-border consolidation. Any operations that we could see were on a much smaller scale. This is linked to the banking union, which has still not been finalised. We should welcome the incoming German government’s inclusion of this point in its programme. Once banking union has been achieved, we will have a common deposit guarantee scheme in addition to single supervision and a single banking resolution mechanism. I expect that consolidation will then play a more prominent role.[end_answer] The outlook for price developments isn’t entirely clear. What is certain is that the factors behind the high rate of inflation we’re experiencing will not last, and we should see them fade next year. But what I’d first like to draw attention to is that we underestimated inflation developments in 2021. Not only the ECB, but all forecasters. The European Commission published its economic projections two weeks ago, and revised inflation figures upwards.[end_answer] Why? Because the base effects linked to supply problems and energy costs were stronger than we envisaged. In 2022, bottlenecks may last longer than expected. As a result, there’s a risk that inflation will not go down as quickly and as much as we predicted.[end_answer] Amid the current uncertainty, it’s crucial to look at inflation expectations, to see what level they will settle at. For the time being, they’re a little below our inflation target of 2%, which is largely reassuring. But we need to remain vigilant to avoid second-round effects via wages. In that case, the upward inflationary trend could be more long-lasting. We haven’t seen any such effects yet. However, it should be noted that owing to the pandemic, most wage negotiations have been postponed to the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. So we should be very careful.[end_answer] What we will do is adjust our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) to the dynamics of inflation, to our economic forecasts and to the changing health situation. The programme was designed to deal with the consequences of the pandemic. Despite the recent rise in infections, COVID-19 will eventually fade away. But we will not go ahead with tapering (phasing out purchases), as the US Federal Reserve has done. The President of the ECB has announced that net purchases will end in March. But they could be resumed if necessary.[end_answer] From a personal perspective, I think that monetary policy must remain accommodative after the PEPP has ended, because some of the scars left by the pandemic haven’t properly healed yet. Even if we have returned to pre-crisis levels of production and income. We must therefore keep our monetary policy accommodative, although not to the extent that we did at the height of the crisis in order to meet our medium-term inflation objective, and be even more driven by economic data.[end_answer] We haven’t discussed that yet, but I’ll give you my personal opinion. If we look at our forward guidance (note: the ECB’s tool for steering market expectations) we have two main instruments: asset purchases and key interest rates. And we make it clear that we will start increasing our rates shortly after we have ended our net asset purchases. I’m confident that those net purchases will continue throughout next year. Beyond that, I don’t know.","['rate of inflation', 'underestimated inflation', 'inflation figures upwards', 'inflation will not go down', 'inflation target', 'meet our medium-term

How would you assess your term so far, and what aims do you have for the second half?[end_question] I thought you might be a little more optimistic, but it seems you are happy with mitigating the consequences and going back to where we were before.[end_question] In such an environment, do you think the economy is ready for a gradual withdrawal of asset purchases?[end_question] But with that in mind, is it not too early to determine whether or not the European economy is ready for the emergency purchases to be withdrawn?[end_question] Up until now, you have said that we would reach pre-COVID income levels in the first quarter of 2022. Is it the improving economic forecasts that are now leading you to say this could happen by the end of the year?[end_question] Does this improvement in the projections also apply to Spain?[end_question] What are your expectations for inflation growth?[end_question] What is the ECB’s assessment of the measures governments have taken to soften the impact of the crisis? Did they get it right, or have they gone too far?[end_question] Were any measures missing? Or do you maybe think some measures went too far, like public borrowing?[end_question] With the worst of the pandemic over, should steps now be taken to reduce public debt and correct the deficit?[end_question] Nobody is saying that adjustments won’t be necessary, but there are two schools of thought: one is in favour of starting to talk about them already, while the other would prefer to put it off until later. Which do you most identify with?[end_question] Although fiscal policy is the European Commission’s responsibility, are you not afraid that this increase in public debt could once again raise the issue of the link between sovereign risk and the banking sector?[end_question] All of the ECB’s actions have contributed towards eliminating these negative links. But its actions carry risks as well as benefits. For example, the more stimulus there is, the more difficult it is to withdraw. How dangerous an obstacle is this?[end_question] The Bundesbank recently renewed its criticism of the ECB’s ultra-loose policy. In the current climate, does this stance worry you?[end_question] We wanted to ask you about that. Some say it is a missed opportunity, others that it goes too far. Do you think it will still be around in another 20 years?[end_question] But do you see signs that the market thinks that the ECB will be more tolerant about inflation?[end_question] But the definition is more tolerant.[end_question] One of the risks of monetary policy is the development of bubbles in assets such as real estate, which has continued to increase considerably in Spain. Do you see a risk of overheating?[end_question] And, in your view, have the conditions been met for macroprudential buffers to be activated in certain countries?[end_question] There have been quite a lot of mergers in Spain. When you were a minister you worked with the idea of there being fewer banks. Do you think there is still scope to work along these lines?[end_question] And in this context of overcapacity and the need to improve profitability, what are your views on the debate in Spain about bank redundancies? Could it get in the way of the improvements needed in terms of profitability?[end_question] Following the controversy surrounding [the asset management company] Sareb, would you change anything from the 2012 bailout?[end_question] During the latest round of earnings announcements, the banks have been clear that current provisions are more than sufficient, and some even see the right conditions to start releasing some, which goes against the ECB’s message. Have the banks won the battle with the supervisor?[end_question] Despite all the attention the ECB has given to stopping reputational issues in the banking sector, they are still very much present, at least in Spain with cases like Villarejo. Does it worry you that there is no end to such cases?[end_question] Disclaimer","1 September 2021[end_answer] These three years have been extremely interesting, and they have been marked, above all else, by the pandemic – an extraordinary event that has sparked an enormous health crisis. It had an extremely severe economic impact in a short space of time, which required an unprecedented economic and monetary policy response. The next 18 to 24 months will be defined by attempts to leave the economic consequences of the pandemic behind us and to minimise its structural impact. That will be the main objective.[end_answer] Some of the short-term impact has been successfully mitigated, but the pandemic will have had structural effects on the European and world economies. The fiscal effects will be the most apparent, with the euro area’s average debt-to-GDP ratio 20 percentage points higher and more pronounced structural deficits. There is also other scarring, which could be structural, in the job market, as well as greater inequality between advanced and emerging economies. The pandemic has had a greater impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, low-income workers and women.[end_answer] I was talking about the medium term in what I just said. The ECB’s primary response to the crisis consisted of action in three different areas. The first focused on liquidity, through the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTROs, supporting banks’ credit provision to households and firms. The second focused on asset purchases through our emergency [purchase] programme. And the third focused on changes in the field of banking supervision to enable banks to free up capital and increase their lending capacity. These measures were crucial to averting a debt crisis. Bond market fragmentation has been avoided, and we have ensured that financing conditions remain favourable. Future monetary policy decisions will essentially depend on how the economy and inflation develop in the coming months.[end_answer] The monetary policy measures were intended to limit the impact of the pandemic on the economy, maintain favourable financing conditions and ensure we met our inflation target. Looking at the European economy, you can see that the recovery was very strong in the second quarter, and we believe it will continue to be fairly strong in the third and fourth quarters. Our emergency [purchase] programme is linked to the pandemic and its economic consequences. But one thing is clear: recent data are very positive. The European economy will be able to recover its pre-pandemic income levels by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. We will have new projections in the coming days and will take our decisions accordingly. In September we will also have to decide on the volume of purchases for the last quarter of this year. If inflation and the economy recover, then there will logically be a gradual normalisation of monetary policy, and of fiscal policy too.[end_answer] It is a nuanced issue – we are talking about just a few months. The economy is performing better in 2021 than we expected, and this will be reflected in the projections that will be published in the coming days. The leading indicators are positive, and in the coming days we will see the actual figures. The main uncertainty was the impact the Delta variant would have. What we are seeing is that it is not having as great an impact as we projected four months ago. This is mainly because governments have responded with fewer restrictions on economic activity than we had anticipated.[end_answer] The Spanish economy shrunk by 10.8% in 2020, more than any other euro area economy. So it should logically experience a stronger-than-average recovery. A country’s economic development during the pandemic should be assessed in terms of when it recovers its previous income levels.[end_answer] Inflation will continue to pick up in 2021. Our baseline scenario is that it will fall back in 2022. We have to check that there are no second-round effects, because that would mean this temporary impact would become structural.[end_answer] In terms of fiscal policy, governments acted in a very similar manner. First, they provided public guarantees, so credit continued to flow. Second, they granted moratoria, which have also had a positive impact. And third, the temporary layoff schemes that have been introduced in various countries have also been very effective. These measures have taken the sting out of the crisis, the impact of which has been greater on GDP than on employment. In Europe, GDP fell by 7%, but employment by just 2%. However, if we look at the figures for hours worked, the fall was greater.[end_answer] The measures were appropriate. The rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio was inevitable. Significant action was needed in the realm of fiscal policy. The alternative would have been worse. And at the European level, this time there was a response that stood out: Next Generation EU. European funds, if used well, will be crucial to the recovery.[end_answer] The premature withdrawal of stimulus should be avoided given that the economic situation is still fragile. Some measures are being gradually withdrawn, such as temporary layoff schemes, debt moratoria and loan guarantee schemes. In that respect, we are seeing how fiscal measures are starting to adjust to a certain degree of normalisation. The withdrawal should be prudent, while also avoiding leaving measures in place for too long leading to the creation of moral hazard or the zombification of the European economy.[end_answer] Once the pandemic and its effects are over, countries are going to find themselves with higher deficits and, more importantly, with much higher levels of public debt. Once the effects of the pandemic are behind us, credible budgetary plans will be required. It will be up to the European Commission to set the pace in this area, since this is a fiscal policy issue. The general escape clause will apply next year, but once pre-pandemic income levels are reached, the Stability and Growth Pact will once again be taken into consideration.[end_answer] The pandemic has brought about an increase in budget deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios. It has also led to greater divergence between countries. Those with a debt-to-GDP ratio higher than the European average will have to make a greater effort to rectify this situation through a credible budgetary plan. It’s that simple. The European Commission will decide on the exact form, and in any case, any plan must be implemented gradually and cautiously.[end_answer] At the start of the crisis, one of our main concerns was the risk of a “doom loop”, i.e. the interconnectedness of firms, banks and sovereigns and the risks that could arise from it. Fortunately, these risks did not materialise. The non-performing loan ratio has continued to fall, it has not had an impact on bank balance sheets and credit did not dry up, which would have made the economic situation worse. And this occurred thanks to the fiscal policy measures, the debt moratoria, the government loan guarantee schemes, the liquidity we have provided to banks and the fact that the ECB’s actions have ensured that financing conditions remain favourable.[end_answer] This is the negative link that has been avoided and that we must continue to avoid. How can we do this? By withdrawing stimulus gradually. There must first be an economic recovery before monetary policy and fiscal policy can return to normal. But obviously we will not always have emergency programmes, since that would mean that we had not put the pandemic and related costs behind us.[end_answer] Withdrawal of the extraordinary stimulus measures should be aligned with changes in economic activity levels. If things start to return to normal, as is currently the case, the extraordinary measures will have to be gradually withdrawn. We should monitor economic developments, inflation and economic projections. We will analyse upside and downside risks, then make a decision. We rely on the data. At the end of 2019, before the pandemic, the ECB had its monetary policy and governments had their fiscal policy. When the pandemic is over, we will have to return to using the economic, fiscal and monetary stimulus measures that correspond to a normal economy. We are not there yet, but we are gradually and continually moving towards that point.[end_answer] In a very high percentage of cases, the ECB’s monetary policy was adopted unanimously. This was the case for the pandemic emergency purchase programme. Different points of view do of course exist; there are 25 of us on the Governing Council. Sometimes we take decisions unanimously and other times with a large majority. The strategy review, for example, was adopted unanimously.[end_answer] I wouldn’t dare make forecasts for the next 20 years. Besides, we have said that the Governing Council intends to assess periodically the appropriateness of its strategy, and the next assessment will take place in 2025.[end_answer] It’s not a question of being more tolerant. We have changed the definition of price stability, but that doesn’t mean that in general we will accept a much higher rate of inflation. We have set our target based on a logical development. The inflation target is now 2% over the medium term and not “below, but close to, 2%”, as it was before. That’s not revolutionary. We continue to be fully committed to price stability.[end_answer] Yes, but that’s a marginal issue. We have said that our target is symmetric, meaning that any negative or positive deviations from the 2% target are equally undesirable. This is important because up until now, the perception was that the ECB acted more forcefully when inflation overshot the target. But we’re not like the Federal Reserve System and we don’t accept inflation compensation. What we have said is that inflation can be temporarily and moderately higher than 2% because current interest rates are zero or close to zero. But that does not mean that in general we have raised our level of acceptance of high inflation.[end_answer] There are certain sectors in the European real estate market, such as residential real estate, where we are seeing prices rising and which we are therefore monitoring. These cases of very specific sectors, which are nevertheless starting to become more common, have to be addressed through macroprudential policy. Monetary policy is not the appropriate tool because it cannot differentiate in that regard.[end_answer] There were some countries, like Germany or France, which had taken measures such as activating the additional capital buffer. But they deactivated it when the pandemic hit, which makes sense. Once things return to normal, it would also make sense to take measures of this kind if there are instances of overheating.[end_answer] The context is one of low profitability in the banking sector, and consolidation is a tool that can be used to improve profitability through cost savings. But it is a tool and not an end in itself. It’s the market, not the ECB, that takes decisions about bank consolidation. What the ECB has identified – in Europe, not just in Spain – is an environment of low profitability. This has now improved because the level of provisioning hasn’t been as high as it initially might have needed to be. From the structural perspective, Europe is facing a situation of overcapacity and excess costs. And consolidation is a tool that can be used to bring about improvements in those areas.[end_answer] As ECB Vice-President I can’t comment on that kind of domestic matter. In general, bank consolidation is one of the methods that can help to improve profitability. This sometimes means making adjustments, which can be painful in the short term. But if the adjustments are not made, there’s the possibility of a crisis. Moreover, bank profitability is not only a medium-term problem. It has implications for banks’ ability to generate capital now, and it even ends up affecting their lending capacity. Of course, we must think about measures that might minimise the downside of the necessary adjustments. But, if nothing is done, over time that low profitability ends up becoming a much more structural crisis.[end_answer] The bank bailout allowed Spain to grow [at a rate] above the European average for years and has made it easier for Spanish banks to face the stress tests and the crisis with sufficient levels of solvency. Having said that, there is always room for improvement.[end_answer] It’s not a matter of battles. A wave of corporate bankruptcies, as was feared in March or April last year, has been successfully averted. But the fact that developments in non-performing loans lag behind economic developments must be taken into account. And this is particularly true in the current circumstances, when there have been moratoria and government guarantees. The current low levels of non-performing loans don’t appropriately reflect what might happen in the coming months. Non-performing loans are going to rise. So from the financial stability and supervisory perspectives, caution is the best approach. Banks will have to adjust those provisions to an increase in non-performing loans due to the significant time lags. The “fallen angels” situation has been avoided, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be an increase in non-performing loans in the coming quarters. And if that happens, provisions will have to be adjusted.[end_answer] A bank’s main asset is its reputation. The banks themselves have the greatest interest in their reputation being spotless, since their credibility and business depend crucially on the trust that is placed in them.","['inflation develop',

402,2021-08-21,Interview with Focus,Isabel Schnabel,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2021/html/ecb.in210821~186713780d.en.html,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Carla Neuhaus on 17 August and published on 20 August 2021","Ms Schnabel, do you see the images of the catastrophic floods in Germany or the forest fires in Greece as a sign that the ECB should also do something to counter climate change?[end_question] But why is that a topic for a central bank?[end_question] Critics say that it is up to governments to respond to that, not the ECB…[end_question] Does climate change push up prices?[end_question] But rather?[end_question] What does that mean for the work of the ECB?[end_question] The ECB is still buying particularly high amounts of bonds from firms with high carbon emissions.[end_question] Why not?[end_question] But how do you intend to ensure that the firms actually put the funds raised by issuing bonds towards revamping their business model?[end_question] So is exclusively purchasing green bonds not an option?[end_question] As a central banker you also need to keep an eye on financial stability. Could the climate crisis become a financial crisis?[end_question] What does that mean in practice?[end_question] What conclusion can be drawn from your results?[end_question] Are these climate risks factored in at all right now? Do rating agencies take them into account when assessing the creditworthiness of firms, for example?[end_question] What is the situation like for banks?[end_question] Isn’t it in the banks’ best interest to know their risks?[end_question] Will climate considerations play a role in banks’ future lending decisions?[end_question] To what extent is inflation affected by climate policy measures, for example the introduction of a new carbontax in Germany?[end_question] In Germany, the inflation rate is already 3.8%. Are you not worried?[end_question] So the high inflation rate doesn’t bother you?[end_question] Does this mean that you see no reason to change your loose monetary policy any time soon?[end_question] Why exactly did the ECB change its inflation target? It used to be “below, but close to, two per cent”, now the inflation rate is also allowed to moderately exceed it.[end_question] What’s next for the economy? Are we going to see the strong recovery we’re hoping for?[end_question] Disclaimer","21 August 2021[end_answer] For me, the latest events have confirmed that we are doing the right thing with our new strategy. Only recently we decided to give more consideration to climate protection in our monetary policy. Climate change is the greatest challenge of the 21st century. Unfortunately, we will likely see extreme weather events, such as those we have just experienced, more frequently in future.[end_answer] Climate change has far-reaching effects on economic developments and therefore also on price stability – which is our main task. For example, it exposes the economy to more frequent macroeconomic shocks, which has an impact on growth and inflation.[end_answer] Of course governments are primarily responsible for taking action. But we as the central bank cannot just stand on the sidelines and do nothing. Our primary objective is to keep prices stable in the euro area. And climate change has large implications for price stability. That is why we are obliged to act in order to fulfil our mandate.[end_answer] That can happen if firms pass on to customers the higher costs they incur by having to become more environmentally friendly or having to adapt their business models. Think of the transition from combustion engines to electromobility or the energy sector’s changeover to renewable energy sources. Added to that is the increasing price of carbon. Food prices may rise, too, if droughts or floods occur more frequently in the future. Nonetheless, it’s not certain that climate change and the transition to a climate-neutral economy lead to higher inflation.[end_answer] Countervailing effects are also conceivable. For example, the prices for sustainable energy sources may decline if more efficient technologies are developed. It may then become cheaper to generate electricity from renewable energy sources. We will therefore have to see which effects ultimately prevail.[end_answer] We will need to incorporate climate change considerations into all of our future activities. That starts with us having to redesign the models underlying our forecasts and monetary policy. To do so we need new data that we will have to collect. Climate change will in the future play just as much of a role in banking supervision as in our monetary policy measures, such as our asset purchases.[end_answer] That’s true. When purchasing corporate bonds, we have up to now been guided by the bonds available in the market. That automatically results in us holding a relatively large number of bonds issued by firms with high carbon emissions as part of our portfolio, because such firms usually have considerable financing needs and issue large amounts of bonds. We therefore need to reconsider the principle of market neutrality that we have adhered to up to now. However, it would not make sense to completely exclude climate offenders.[end_answer] We have to focus on accelerating the transition to a climate-neutral economy. Excluding certain sectors or firms from our asset purchase programme would be counterproductive. In order to lower emissions, firms with high levels of carbon emissions are extremely important because they offer scope for making the most progress. If these firms want to become climate-neutral, they are dependent on favourable financial conditions.[end_answer] To that end we need to draw up new criteria for selecting bonds. For example, we could in the future buy more bonds from firms that commit to the goals of the Paris climate agreement and thus show that they are willing to adapt their business model.[end_answer] No, a purely green asset purchase programme would not be realistic at present in any case. Even though the market is growing rapidly, there would still be far too few green bonds. And let’s not forget: we are already buying almost a quarter of eligible outstanding green bonds.[end_answer] Climate change is also an unprecedented risk for the financial system – and it is not limited to one country but has a global effect. This is what we call a systemic risk.[end_answer] Around a third of the loans that euro area banks have granted to firms are – to a significant or increasing degree − exposed to climate risks from extreme weather events. That emerged from our macroeconomic stress test, for which we recently evaluated data from 2,000 banks and four million firms. We took into account the effects of natural catastrophes such as floods, forest fires and droughts, which entail huge losses for firms and thus also for banks and insurance companies. In addition, the climate transition measures pose a threat to many firms’ business models.[end_answer] Above all, they tell us that the earlier we react, the better. We can then still shape the transition to climate neutrality in a way that allows firms to adapt. The longer we wait, the faster and more radically we will have to respond. If the transition comes too late and too fast, many firms could become insolvent and banks could face high loan defaults.[end_answer] Currently, climate-related risks are presumably not yet appropriately reflected in prices. However, rating agencies are aware of the problem and are working hard to take better account of climate-related risks when assessing credit quality.[end_answer] The ECB as European banking supervisor has already made it very clear to banks that they need to consider climate-related risks. However, initial analyses show that not a single credit institution is fully compliant with the outlined requirements. The progress made by individual banks varies greatly: while some have made significant headway, others still have a long way to go. That needs to change.[end_answer] Indeed it is; that is why banks are keen to tackle this issue. As early as next year there will be a comprehensive supervisory review of how banks account for climate-related risks in their balance sheets.[end_answer] Yes, it is safe to assume so. Climate-related risks will weigh more heavily in future decisions whether, for example, a company will be granted a loan and at what terms. Climate may also play a role in real estate lending: it might become easier to borrow money to build an energy-efficient property. This would set incentives, making energy-efficient buildings more attractive. This is why banks play a key role in the green transformation.[end_answer] At the beginning of the year, prices went up following the introduction of the carbontax in Germany. For now, these are one-off effects. Nevertheless, a gradual increase in carbon prices may well lead to higher inflation rates in the coming years.[end_answer] We are faced with a very unusual situation and the current high inflation figures are largely due to transitory effects. At the beginning of the pandemic, inflation decreased significantly starting with the first lockdown. This was mostly due to the fall in energy prices and the policy reactions to the crisis – such as the VAT cut in Germany. Now that we are seeing the economy reopen, these effects are reversing. Energy prices are rising, the VAT rate has gone back to its original level, and all of that automatically pushes inflation much higher. In part, this is simply because the high prices of today are set against the very low prices of last year – the inflation rate always shows the change in consumer prices year-on-year.[end_answer] No, but I do understand why people might be worried. However, if you compare today’s prices with those before the pandemic, it doesn’t look all that dramatic. While we expect inflation to continue rising until the end of this year, especially in Germany, our estimate is that it will fall significantly as of next year.[end_answer] That’s right, because monetary policy looks at inflation developments in the medium term. And on that horizon, we expect inflation in the euro area to be below our target of two per cent. As surprising as it may sound to some – we are more worried about the inflation rate being too low in the medium term rather than too high. This may change, of course, for example if trade unions were to negotiate higher wages. But appropriate wage adjustments would also be a good sign from our point of view. Increased demand on the back of higher real wages would bring us closer to our inflation target – which we have been falling short of for years – and help us escape the low interest rate environment.[end_answer] The old wording was less clear and had occasionally been misinterpreted. Some had seen it as a ceiling, assuming that while inflation must not exceed it, undershooting it would not be a problem. That is why we made it clear: the target for us is two per cent. And it is symmetric, meaning that too low inflation is considered equally undesirable as too high inflation.[end_answer] We continue to expect to see a strong recovery. Given the high level of vaccinations, another hard lockdown is unlikely, despite the current rise in incidence rates. The supply-side bottlenecks in some products, such as microchips, are currently the major constraint. This has hit German manufacturers particularly hard. To solve the problem, it would be important for the international community to support developing countries in boosting their vaccination rates in order to successfully contain the virus.","['higher

406,2021-07-10,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung,Isabel Schnabel,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2021/html/ecb.in210710~4b73d128ac.en.html,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Bernau and Dennis Kremer on 8 July and published on 10 July 2021","Ms Schnabel, the ECB has set itself a new, higher inflation target of two per cent. Do people now have to fear higher inflation?[end_question] But if inflation rises too high, it’s not good either.[end_question] What would you do if inflation overshoots this target?[end_question] So Deutsche Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann also gave his agreement.[end_question] The inflation rate in Germany will shortly reach four per cent. Might it be that the ECB has already lost control of inflation?[end_question] What makes you so sure?[end_question] But what if that continues?[end_question] At what rate of inflation will the ECB start to intervene?[end_question] What happens with countries that have high levels of debt, like Italy, if inflation remains high and you raise interest rates? Will it become difficult for them?[end_question] So countries don’t have to worry?[end_question] In the worst case, the ECB would not risk government default.[end_question] The higher inflation target gives you leeway to continue purchasing government bonds for longer.[end_question] You are now describing bond purchases as standard? We learnt something different in college.[end_question] You haven’t placed the resilience of financial markets in the face of crisis at the centre of your new strategy.[end_question] Climate protection also plays an important role in your new strategy. Why is a central bank involving itself in an issue that is not a monetary policy matter?[end_question] Are you also going to be looking at whether companies act in an environmentally friendly way?[end_question] The devil is in the detail. How much agreement is there on that[end_question] What if others pipe up now and say: we are also doing great work for society, give us better financing conditions too?[end_question] If low-carbon firms were issuing more bonds, you would be buying more of them already.[end_question] Is it not something that needs to be decided by democratically elected politicians rather than the ECB?[end_question] 20 years ago the ECB wouldn’t have discussed such specific issues of economic policy.[end_question] Why has this changed?[end_question] You want to communicate your monetary policy discussions in “plain language”. Will you manage?[end_question] The ECB is getting closer to the public.[end_question] Is this where Christine Lagarde’s famous charm comes up against the technocratic leviathan that is the central bank?[end_question] The new strategy was announced sooner than expected – just three short weeks after the Governing Council of the ECB met in the Taunus mountains. Does this suggest that working remotely may not be the answer to everything?[end_question] Disclaimer","8 July 2021[end_answer] No, they don’t. For one thing, the increase in the inflation target is minimal. And for another, a target of two per cent has an important function: it creates space so that our monetary policy can have its stabilising effect. In bad times, such as during the pandemic, monetary policy stimulates the economy through low interest rates and so has significant favourable effects on economic growth and employment. However, today’s interest rates are already so low that they cannot be reduced further very much. That is not primarily the ECB’s doing. We have seen a pronounced desire to save, reflecting demographic developments for example, whereas demand for investments has been comparably low. That is why interest rates worldwide have been falling for many years. The new inflation target safeguards our room to manoeuvre and benefits people.[end_answer] That’s true. The two per cent target also continues to protect people from perceivable losses of purchasing power.[end_answer] Our target is symmetric: inflation may sometimes be slightly above it or below. We look through short-term deviations. By contrast, we regard persistent negative and positive deviations as equally undesirable. But when the economy is close to the lower bound, especially forceful or persistent policy measures are required to safeguard price stability. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above the target of two percent. The Governing Council supported this unanimously.[end_answer] Unanimous means unanimous.[end_answer] No, this development is temporary. Inflation in Germany is now relatively high on account of the pandemic. We will see this as of July – precisely one year after the reduction in value added tax – when prices will be particularly high compared to last year, but only because prices were reduced at that time. The recovery in oil prices has a similar effect. The Deutsche Bundesbank forecasts that inflation will reach just over four per cent in Germany towards the end of this year, but will already fall again significantly next year. Given such short-term fluctuations, the ECB’s monetary policy is oriented towards medium-term price developments – across the entire euro area. Our medium-term inflation projection is subdued: only 1.4 per cent in 2023. Though that is surrounded by uncertainty, I am sure that we will not experience excessively high inflation.[end_answer] We are currently experiencing an exceptional situation. First the economy was shut down and then it opened up more rapidly than expected. Demand consequently soared, but it has outpaced supply. Think of the problems with the supply chains.[end_answer] We will watch that very closely. Whether inflation rises sustainably ultimately hinges on whether wages also rise and amplify inflation through second-round effects. So far we have seen little evidence of that – also in Germany.[end_answer] In previous years, inflation was too low. The global financial crisis, the sovereign debt crisis, the pandemic: all these crises weakened demand and dampened inflation. That is why it is important to firmly anchor people’s inflation expectations close to our target of two per cent. Moderately higher inflation is a sign of a better economic outlook. We have to support this with our monetary policy for as long as it takes to achieve our medium-term inflation target.[end_answer] Governments will manage this. Many euro area countries reacted to low interest rates by significantly extending the maturities of their sovereign bonds. An interest rate increase has no direct effect on total sovereign debt, but only on the part that has to be refinanced.[end_answer] Every euro area country has to be aware that interest rates will not always remain low. That means, above all, one thing: countries must use targeted measures to deploy the large amounts of public money that have, for good reasons, been made available during the pandemic, so that they get to a sustainable growth path. That is the best way to deal with pandemic-induced higher government debt.[end_answer] We are far away from such a situation, thankfully. During the pandemic, the greatest crisis since the Second World War, there was not a single moment when the debt sustainability of a euro area country was seriously called into question.[end_answer] We are yet to decide on the concrete effects that the new strategy will have on our current monetary policy stance. It is clear that we must achieve our medium-term inflation target in a sustainable manner. Bond purchases are part of our standard toolkit.[end_answer] That is also an outcome of the strategy review. Our primary instrument is the set of ECB policy rates but, when rates approach the lower bound, instruments such as bond purchases are effective and indispensable.[end_answer] Financial stability actually plays a very important role in our new strategy. It comes into play when we assess the costs and benefits of different measures. In addition, we have modified our analytical framework: as before, we have two strands of analysis but they are now more tightly interwoven. The second strand – previously the monetary pillar – has been expanded with financial considerations and now focuses on monetary transmission and financial stability. Few central banks pay such attention to this topic in their monetary policy.[end_answer] Climate protection is first and foremost a matter for governments. But climate change is the greatest risk facing economies in the next decades and it has massive effects on price stability and, consequently, on monetary policy. For instance, climate risks in the financial system can compromise the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. This means we have to take it into consideration in the context of our price stability mandate. Until now, our models have not sufficiently taken climate risks into account. This is something that we want and need to change.[end_answer] It will play a role, both in banking supervision and monetary policy. For example, we are planning to only accept bonds as collateral if the companies that issue them disclose climate-related risks. We also know that private sector bonds bought by the ECB are on average relatively carbon-intensive. This is because we buy bonds according to the volumes that are available on the market, and the market is dominated by carbon-intensive companies. But is the market the right benchmark if it fails to take sufficient account of the climate impact? We will be looking into that very closely.[end_answer] We have unanimously agreed on an ambitious action plan. Individual projects will need to be discussed in detail but we all support the overall goal and planned measures.[end_answer] Our overarching goal is price stability. In the case of climate change, the risk of a severe crisis with wide-ranging consequences for price stability is particularly high, and climate change is at least partially irreversible. So it’s problematic for our policy to favour carbon-intensive business activities.[end_answer] This is exactly the transition we mean. Once the climate measures fully take effect, market distortions will disappear.[end_answer] Politicians have already decided just that. But we know that such transition takes time and requires huge private and public investment. The financial market is crucial here. This is where the central bank plays an important catalyst role and can support political efforts.[end_answer] Climate change was probably not something that was discussed much even five years ago.[end_answer] A lot has changed in society as a whole. The ECB cannot ignore that. We care about the things that are important to the people – for example house prices, which we will account for better in our inflation measure. We engaged with citizens in our strategy review and we will continue to do so. All of this strengthens people’s trust in their central bank, and trust is valuable in monetary policy.[end_answer] Not everyone will follow our monetary policy statements in great detail. The point is to tailor our communication to different target audiences.[end_answer] That is true, and this could support our price stability objective. While the euro enjoys high approval ratings, trust in the ECB fell somewhat after the financial crisis. It has recovered since but we need to do more. To win their trust, we must ensure our actions are understood by the people.[end_answer] Christine Lagarde has made a big difference at the ECB. She has put climate change on the agenda. But the ECB is hardly the only central bank that is looking at that topic.[end_answer] Indeed. Video calls have worked surprisingly well even in serious emergencies. But when trying to reach a consensus, you are much more likely to succeed if you can talk to each other during informal breaks.","['increase in the inflation target', 'inflation target', 'inflation

I believe Lagarde signalled a contraction last week. How much does that matter? Does that obscure the picture of a positive outlook going forward?[end_question] You are often referred to as the Chief Economist of the ECB; can you talk a little bit about forecasting and making predictions in this very particular environment, with economies going into lockdown? Has it been dramatically different?[end_question] If you could summarise the crisis management from the central bank so far: any conclusions? Anything you wish you would’ve done differently?[end_question] A very common critique against central banks in this crisis has been increased economic division through the crisis. Unemployment is still frustratingly high, while markets have been very, very strong. Any thoughts on this dynamic?[end_question] In that context, can you talk a little bit about possible market effects on your stimulus and your purchases? Will you also analyse how the corporate bond market, for example, could have been affected or changed by your purchases?[end_question] Just a quick follow-up. When do you reach a point where you feel uncomfortable at how much of a country’s debt the ECB should own, or of a company’s debt products, say?[end_question] Speaking of the balance, I’d say that you’re not so worried about the fear of inflation that’s been tormenting markets lately. Can I also ask you about the inflation target? Do you at all look at an American-style, more average inflation target?[end_question] Speaking of strategy, I’d like to bring one more central bank into the discussion. The Swedish Riksbank does seem reluctant to go back into negative territory. The ECB has been more comfortable, or at least has been in negative territory for a long time. Any advice or any conclusion from your experience that you would like to share?[end_question] One last question involving the Riksbank: Sweden has been looking at digital currencies for quite some time. More central banks are doing this as of right now. What are your thoughts on central bank digital currencies?[end_question] Disclaimer","29 April 2021[end_answer] We are very much at an inflection point. Until now, the first weeks of this year, the first months of this year, have really still been dominated by all of the measures we’ve needed to take to contain the virus. As we all know, the services sector in Europe has been very restricted by all of the lockdown measures. On the other hand, manufacturing has been quite resilient in these months because the world economy has been recovering, world trade has been recovering, and there are many European firms benefiting from that. And when we look ahead into May, into the summer, into later this year, with vaccinations now having made progress and more to come in the coming weeks, we will see a lifting of restrictions on the services sector.[end_answer] So we do see a good rebound. We do see a good recovery throughout the rest of this year, so that is very much, if you like, a two-sided story. Looking backwards, the initial weeks have been very tough for many firms. When looking forward there will be a rebound, but I should say, of course, this is all in the context of this pandemic being a huge negative shock, and the fact we’re rebounding from the worst of it does not mean there’s a full recovery.[end_answer] That’s what I was trying to refer to in relation to the first months of this year. We do think that the first quarter – which of course ended at the end of March – will have seen a slight contraction. There will have been a fall in output, but we do think the economy will be growing in May and in June, and even more strongly in the third quarter between July and September, with that momentum continuing into the autumn. If you take the whole year, 2021 together, we do think activity will be about 4 per cent above 2020 values. That doesn’t quite recover all of the losses from 2020, but it’s significant progress compared with where we are now.[end_answer] It’s definitely been different. But actually, pretty much exactly a year ago the ECB released its first pandemic scenarios. In those scenarios I think the staff did a really good job, because essentially you might focus on this quarter or that quarter, but in the grand scheme of the whole analysis, the central projection was built upon enough medical solutions being in place by summer 2021 that that’s when the recovery would really take hold. And that’s what we’re seeing. That one-year-ago forecast is holding up pretty well: that around now, the European economy would be about 4 percentage points below the pre-pandemic level. That’s broadly where we are, so actually I think we always have to look beyond the week-by-week or month-by-month fluctuation. When we think about looking a year ahead or 18 months ahead, those forecasts made a year ago have held up pretty well.[end_answer] At some point I do agree we should look backwards and really hold ourselves to account. But I think really there were three tasks. The first task was to stabilise markets a year ago, in March and April last year. The initial shock of the pandemic was affecting market stability everywhere and all central banks had to respond with a range of measures. Our second basic objective was to protect credit supply. We know recessions may be far worse if you add a banking problem on top of an economic problem. Through our various measures in monetary policy and supervision, that has so far been handled – banks have continued lending and providing credit, now, of course, with significant support from government guarantees. The third element was to make sure that monetary support, that interest rate policy – which of course these days is not just about the short-term policy rate that we control, but also through asset purchasing – that long-term rates are also low enough to support a recovery and support inflation momentum.[end_answer] Let me make a sharp distinction: we do think that monetary policy has been very beneficial; I would challenge you in terms of in what way would a tighter monetary policy, would higher interest rates be helpful under this scenario? What is true, and maybe this is where the narrative is complicated, is that the pandemic has definitely been very asymmetric. We’ve seen record earnings this week from all sorts of technology firms, and indeed some investment banking firms. You can see many sectors have been insulated from the crisis, or have even benefited from the move to working from home, while there are so many people, and they’re typically young, disproportionately female, who work in the services sector and who have been burdened with all of the complications from home schooling and so on. So it’s been a very asymmetric recession, but also it’s unprecedented in the amount of fiscal support.[end_answer] We’ve seen record-breaking fiscal responses to the crisis. I think this is really going to be a big issue for the next year or two. How do we navigate not just the economic rebound, but also the correct sequencing and timing of how all of those policy measures will make sure not just that we have a rebound, but that we have a recovery to a sustainable post-pandemic economy?[end_answer] We do think it’s very important and, over time, the evidence is coming in more and more that the corporate sector purchase programme plays a very important role. Let me emphasise: of course it’s important for the large corporates to actually issue bonds. We know that many small businesses, microenterprises, individuals don’t directly participate in the bond market. What that programme does do is, by providing bond market credit for those types of firms, it gives the banks more lending capacity for small firms and for households. So it’s important, when we think about the corporate sector programme, that it should not be a narrow analysis that just focuses on the high-grade corporates who issue bonds, but the fact it has a lot of spill-over effects on the wider credit market and by supporting that type of lending. In fact it opens the door, it creates the space for banks to have a greater willingness and capacity to lend to small firms and to individuals.[end_answer] We definitely operate within parameters, but I would come back to the basic point: all of what we do has to be assessed compared to the monetary policy imperative. Essentially, all of our tools are calibrated to make sure that we have price stability, which in turn does require us to bring inflation up to a higher level. Below, but close to 2 per cent is our current target. It is very important for the long-term stability of the European economy to reach that target. All of our measures, including the asset purchases, are calibrated to that end. I think that balance is something we always keep in mind. We have a wide range of policy tools and by, if you like, balancing across the different policies we have: the interest rate, the targeted lending scheme, asset purchases and of course our forward guidance about the future calibration of these policies, I think we manage that balance.[end_answer] The deeper analysis, which I think the world shares, behind that is essentially that it’s very important in this world where we do have a lower bound on interest rates, where we do have currently low inflation, that everyone concerned should understand that the inflation targets set by central banks are symmetric, that these are not ceilings. One way to make sure that people understand that the centre of the distribution needs to be anchored by the inflation target is that central banks are willing to see inflation not only be below that target but above that target. One way to express that is by emphasising in a flexible way, as the Fed always advertises, average inflation targeting. But actually I think it’s not necessarily the only way and, as you know, we have a strategy review on right now to explore in the European context, in the context of where we are now, which is different from where the Fed is, what the best way to think about our inflation target should be.[end_answer] I’m sure it’s going to be very unsurprising for you to know that I’m not going to comment directly on the policies of the Riksbank. What I would say is, the Riksbank and the ECB – all the major central banks – we study each other’s policies. We learn from each other’s conditions. Essentially, there is no direct read-across because of course where Sweden is in terms of its inflation momentum is different from where the euro area is. So I would not particularly dwell on any differences across the different central banks. If you look at the conditions we face, Europe faces a condition, the euro area faces a condition where we consider negative rates under current conditions to be essential, to be valuable, to be effective. But of course under other conditions, when inflation momentum is a lot stronger, the reaction may be different. Let me emphasise – I read of course all the Riksbank literature – I don’t think this is a statement that negative interest rates are ineffective. Under the conditions that the euro area faces, we continue to assess that this is an essential and valuable part of our current policy toolkit.[end_answer] When you see a phenomenon, which is essentially now a global effort to look at it, it’s some combination of being more optimistic that the technologies can be developed. Given our role in the world of payments and how money is exchanged across people, we do think there are potential gains to society from this. Sometimes that’s a bit mysterious because, of course, payment systems work quite well from the point of view of the consumer. But when you look at the overall costs of how payments are made, having a central bank digital currency may actually be something that unlocks efficiencies, reduces costs. Even if those may not be upfront, visible to every consumer, from society as a whole, those efficiencies, those gains may be quite important. It’s important for central banks, if they see possibilities in a safe way, in a stable way, to help make progress in society along this important dimension, I think it’s incumbent upon us to look and study this carefully.","['inflation momentum', 'bring inflation', 'low inflation', 'inflation targets', 'anchored by the inflation target', 'inflation targeting', 'inflation target', 'inflation

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach on 22 March 2021","Let me bring you first to the increased asset purchases. Your asset purchases are now at €21 billion, is that a level the market should get used to now?[end_question] If you look at the situation in the bond markets, why are you so concerned? Because if you deduct inflation from the nominal rate, real rates are not such a problem?[end_question] When we talk about inflation the Fed has opted to allow overshooting. Would you follow the Fed in that respect?[end_question] Would you say the outlook for economic growth and also inflation may deteriorate with what we’re seeing with the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the big countries, in France and Germany which went straight into lockdown again?[end_question] At the same time, the bond market is especially already playing recovery very strong for the United States. So, are you concerned that there is not a possibility to actually decouple the bond markets because they kind of have a tendency to move in tandem?[end_question] Your Dutch colleague stepped out saying that the scaling-up of the purchases should only be for a certain time until we see a substantial calming-down, perhaps, in the market reaction. Would you agree?[end_question] That brings me directly to the question of favourable financing conditions, because clearly there’s a lot of, you know, interpretation of what that really means and which parameters you’re looking at. Perhaps you could try to explain it a bit more to the markets.[end_question] I had the feeling that during the last meeting, the outlook for the economy was less negative than previously, would you stick to that assessment, also given the situation surrounding the virus now?[end_question] Yes that’s clearly the case, but the response from the United States or from the European Union, if you compare that to the United States, we are lagging far behind, are you concerned that the United States will come out of that crisis with a big bang because of their fiscal stimulus. And Europe has to again, like after the last crisis, face many years until we actually recover?[end_question] So in other words, the longer the pandemic lasts, the higher the pressure also on Brussels to think about increasing the package?[end_question] The fiscal response clearly is a huge step for the European Union with these Next Generation EU bonds. And this would probably also mean that we are going to have a proper European yield curve at one point in time. Is that something which makes monetary policy easier?[end_question] Disclaimer","23 March 2021[end_answer] As you know, the weekly data are always confounded a bit by redemptions and the week-to-week special factors, but it does reflect our commitment to have a substantial increase in the pace of purchasing. I wouldn’t take any one week in isolation, but of course if you average over several weeks you will see the substantial increase in a consistent way.[end_answer] We have an inflation forecast which remains quite low, so even in 2023 inflation is only at 1.4% in our forecast. In that context, we would like to see fairly low rates remaining. In fact if we do see inflation pick up − and let me emphasise what really matters with respect to inflation is economy-wide, not just the viewpoint of financial traders, but we would need to see it in firms and households as well − so ideally any pick-up in expected inflation, if it adds to inflation momentum we welcome it. You have to compare the nominal yields we see with respecttothe inflation forecast we have, which remains at 1.4% two years ahead.[end_answer] That’s an interesting debate and we have our strategy review and we are still in the middle of that. But the deeper point here is that in a world where essentially lots of central banks have a situation where inflation is too low compared to their target, the universal emphasis and our emphasis has to be to make sure that monetary policy support remains in place until inflation is robustly where we want it to be. We’ve already given forward guidance since September 2019, and we want inflation to robustly converge to our targets. That should provide enough guidance that monetary policy support will be in place until we see that robust convergence.[end_answer] It’s important to emphasise that when we made our recent forecasts a couple of weeks ago, we did allow for some extension into the second quarter. So the fact we are now seeing decisions to have lockdown measures extended into April is not too surprising. I would share the concern and it’s not about the lockdown measures because those just reflect the underlying contest with the virus itself. Until the virus is more contained, until we have more progress on vaccinations, and until it’s clearer these mutations are not going to have a prolonged impact, it’s clearly a risk factor. As we now go into the second quarter, it’s going to be a long quarter. The concerning news is that the virus case numbers are remaining high and are creeping up. On the other hand, we also see that in the second quarter over these three months in April, May and June there will be a lot of vaccinations taking place, so over the course of those three months it will be a contest between progress and vaccinations and other medical progress versus the near-term challenge of trying to get this virus under control.[end_answer] This is essentially very much on our minds. And of course, the historic correlation between international bond yields and euro area bond yields is something we can respond to. So, if you like, the fact that we responded in our March decision by stepping up the pace of purchasing is a reflection that we can decouple, if you like, the trend in the international bond market and the trend in the euro area market. I mean, I don’t say that’s 100% decoupling. It’s also the case, as you know, that the increase in yields in recent times in the euro area has not been up to the same scale as in the United States. And in the end, it’s for us to determine, as we did in the March decision, based on the joint assessment of what's going on in terms of financing conditions, and also what we see in terms of the inflation outlook – that will determine how much we react in terms of the scale of asset purchasing.[end_answer] I think behind that comment, underlying that comment, and I think our shared view, is essentially it depends on the pandemic. I mean, of course, the programme, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), is centred on the pandemic emergency. And as we've been discussing, right now there’s a lot of uncertainty about the coming weeks. But as I've also emphasised, we also think there’s going to be a lot of vaccinations in these in these weeks and months. And, you know, we’ve tried to add, to recognise, that the uncertainty is a dominant feature. And no matter how the pandemic plays out, whether it plays out with some disappointment, or whether there’s some acceleration of good news, the PEPP is designed to be flexible, and to respond. So, you know, when Klaas was speaking, he provided a conjecture about one pathway. But the more overriding theme, I think, is with uncertainty about the pandemic, the PEPP will adjust in a flexible way to make sure that financing conditions remain favourable and, in particular, that they've remained supportive of countering the pandemic shock to inflation.[end_answer] The European economy has a mixed financial system. We know for firms and households, it’s bank-based. But of course, market-based funding is also very important for large corporates, for sovereigns. And so this is why we do take a broad approach where we want to look at what’s going on in terms of market conditions. But also, what we see in terms of the funding conditions facing the customers of banks. What we did also emphasise in the March meeting was the special status or role, if you like, for the risk-free curve, and the sovereign yields as well, because they’ve played such an important role in the overall financing conditions of the euro area. And also, it’s obvious when we think about our asset purchasing, that’s where we operate on, we operate on the risk-free curve and the sovereign yields. And that’s why we pay particular attention when we see a significant movement in these yields, as we did over recent weeks.[end_answer] So I think we made two statements about that. One is that in the near term, this downside risk was prominent. So the downside risk about whether the pandemic would quickly be controlled remains the dominant issue in the near term. But we also said that the overall balance of risk was becoming more balanced because compared to December, we have the avoidance of a more difficult Brexit outcome. We’ve had the stimulus, fiscal stimulus coming from the United States, we’ve had better data in relation to the end of 2020 in quarter three and quarter four. So we’ve had several pieces of news that would have, if you like, renewed confidence in the medium-term outlook. But at the same time, as we’ve been talking about, we do have this near-term uncertainty, this near-term concern about the pathway for the virus.[end_answer] So let me break that into two different questions. One is there will be positive spillovers from the United States. The fact that there is a significant stimulus in the United States will boost global GDP, will boost exports from the euro area. Of course, the initial impact was visible more in the financial markets. But over time, as the stimulus gets rolled out, it will be a significant engine for the world economy. I would emphasise, of course, given the nature of the United States, that you can have very large fiscal packages embodied in a single piece of legislation. As you know, in the European situation, we have a mix. We have 19 national fiscal policies, and then we have the joint fiscal action. So maybe it's worth keeping in mind the statement from the Eurogroup from a couple of weeks ago, which heavily emphasised that the Eurogroup collectively are paying close attention, and essentially committing that there will be an agile fiscal response in recognition that as this pandemic unfolds, it is very important that fiscal support is maintained, and that there is no early exit. So I think, then maybe you see every week or every few days, a fiscal announcement coming from individual member countries. So I do think the forward guidance is there, from the Eurogroup, that the scale of fiscal policy will respond to the unfolding of the pandemic. But I do think it's for all of us to reflect; the parameters of the fiscal debate have clearly moved with the US decision. And it is an important issue for European policymakers to reflect upon about how to calibrate the European fiscal response, and to make sure it's sufficient to get through this pandemic.[end_answer] Well, I think again, there's a range of possibilities. And, of course, we also have to do the basics of making sure that the recovery plans are finalised; that’s been a heavy focus of work in recent times. So again, the combination of national fiscal policy and EU level really has to be set so that as the pandemic unfolds, fiscal policy is agile. And I think that is the commitment of the Eurogroup.[end_answer] Of course, the significant bond issuance that's envisaged on the Next Generation EU, and the fact that it's going to have a whole range of maturities will be helpful in deepening the stock of safe assets in the euro area. It will be an important reference point. But I would try to avoid arguing that there needs to be one single reference point in thinking about the pricing of European assets. So I think the nature of Europe is it's always going be a mix of EU level and national level fiscal policy, and how we think about the stock of safe assets, how we think about reference points, I think will reflect that. As we've talked about earlier on, you know, we essentially are jointly looking at the risk-free curve, where we often use the overnight index swap curve as a kind of useful proxy for that. But we also look at the whole constellation of sovereign yields. Now, when we have more EU issuance, we already have the SURE bonds. I think it's super informative and super helpful to have that. But I think the overall message is, the stock of safe assets in Europe is going up, not just because of the EU level issuance, but because of the decline in risk premia for many sovereigns in the euro area.","['inflation forecast which remains quite low', 'inflation pick up', 'pick-up in expected inflation', 'inflation momentum', 'inflation is too low', 'inflation to robustly converge to our

434,2022-12-31,Interview with Jutarnji List,Christine Lagarde,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2022/html/ecb.in221231~16c85cd5a3.en.html,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by Marina Klepo on 19 December 2022","Eight months after you became ECB President, the Croatian kuna and the Bulgarian lev were included in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II. After the shortest period in the ERM II of all new EU Member States, Croatia is now also about to join the euro area. Was such an outcome a surprise for you?[end_question] Over the past few years, people in Croatia have had a chance to hear a lot of arguments in favour of introducing the euro, but the most prominent ones – such as lower interest rates and more favourable borrowing terms – have become less convincing due to a change in circumstances. People worry that the euro will only spur inflation. To what extent have these new circumstances changed the narrative in terms of the costs and benefits of introducing the euro?[end_question] A deterioration in loan conditions seems inevitable?[end_question] As interest rates increase, at least depositors should benefit?[end_question] Even though Croatia is currently in a celebratory mood, it faces numerous challenges. While the ECB’s June Convergence Report said that Croatia fulfilled all the conditions for adopting the euro, one could also read warnings that its potential growth rate is low and that more should be done to ensure it catches up with the living standards of other Member States.[end_question] The past experience of some countries, like Greece with its debt crisis and even Slovenia with its banking crisis, indicates that members of the club easily overlook what is important to undertake on time.[end_question] Nevertheless, Croatia cannot be said to have been particularly successful in implementing structural reforms, despite having managed to fulfil all formal criteria for admission to the euro area and even the Schengen Area? For example, reforms of public administration, business climate, the healthcare system...[end_question] Accession to the euro area changes the definition of international currency reserves. A portion of reserves goes into the Eurosystem, but the largest portion remains within the competence of the Croatian central bank which believes that it needs to continue managing them. However, there are different positions on this in Croatia’s public sector, including using a portion of these reserves for other purposes such as repaying public debt. What do ECB procedures say on this, what practices were employed by other new members of the euro area?[end_question] How do you currently view the economic situation in the euro area to which Croatia is being admitted? An increasing number of indicators suggest that the energy crisis may be less difficult than was thought a few months ago, so the recession could be short-lived and mild?[end_question] Obviously, the three important words “whatever it takes” apply almost equally to inflation as they did to the euro?[end_question] There are doubts as to the extent to which monetary policy can do that, given that the main cause of inflation is not consumption but rising energy prices and disruptions to global value chains?[end_question] What is your position on views that a deeper recession will be essential for curbing inflation?[end_question] In a way, the Croatian central bank Governor Boris Vujčić is a declared “hawk”; he believes that inflation growth comes at a higher cost than a temporary GDP decline and advocates more aggressive interest rate hikes and earlier quantitative tightening. Can you briefly explain the process of Governing Council decision-making and how consensus is reached?[end_question] How do you see the process of euro area expansion looking ahead? Some countries are not overly interested in adopting the euro, even though surveys show the majority of non-Member States except the Czech Republic being in favour?[end_question] Do you believe there are economic or political reasons in the background?[end_question] Disclaimer","31 December 2022[end_answer] I will focus on Croatia, which is becoming a new member of our family. I believe it has achieved exceptional success and that is big news. Being able to do all that – covering all the areas within a period of ten years between accession to the European Union and euro area entry – is an incredible success. Croatia has implemented reforms and the necessary restructuring and done everything to continue to have sound public finances. So it fully deserves to be admitted to the euro area on 1 January 2023, and it is wonderful to welcome the 20th member to the family when we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of euro banknotes and coins. This is big news and a reason for all of us to celebrate![end_answer] It is good to have the euro because it can operate as a shield. Once a euro area country, always a euro area country. All for one and one for all. We are together in this, all soon-to-be 20 euro area countries. I am old enough to remember when France became a member of the euro area and we exchanged the franc for the euro. We were also worried that abandoning our currency and adopting the common currency might have grave consequences in terms of higher prices and less independence. However, looking back on 23 years of the euro and 20 years of euro banknotes and coins, we can say that it has paid off – the euro has brought protection and strength. The initial concern that prices will be a little higher can be allayed. I am certain that the Croatian government has taken the necessary steps, such as ensuring prices are clearly displayed in both kuna and euro. In France, too, we were able to monitor the prices in both francs and euro for about half a year. It is a really good way of providing information because it is difficult, especially for elderly citizens, to switch to another currency all of a sudden. I believe that pocket calculators (or apps for the younger generation) displaying the price of a desired product in both currencies are useful in that process, as they were to us in France. I also trust that there are arrangements in place to punish those who abuse the system, who take advantage of the conversion to raise prices. There must be a combination of measures in place to facilitate the conversion while, at the same time, not allowing it to result in difficulties for citizens.[end_answer] Interest rates are increasing for everyone. At the moment, ECB policy rates must be higher to curb inflation and bring it down to our target of 2%. That process is essential because it would be even worse if we allowed inflation to become entrenched in the economy. So, we must do it now, but this is in no way connected to Croatia introducing the euro.[end_answer] We have a mandate to ensure price stability, and we have to fulfil it.[end_answer] I would like to say two things. Croatia is already very well integrated in the euro area. If you look at the denomination of household or government debt, a high level of euroisation is evident. Second, Croatia is a very open economy. Looking at investment and tourism, the benefit of not having currency exchange operations is unequivocal. I have been to Dubrovnik, that wonderful Croatian city, and the fact that, in the future, people will not even have to think about the exchange rate or conversion fees will certainly foster tourism, which makes up a significant proportion of Croatian GDP (around 20%), as well as investment. Finally, people in Croatia have demonstrated that they are able to improve the country’s circumstances, that they can catch up with other countries, that they can take the steps necessary to become a member of the club. I see no reason for this to stop now. My only advice would be: do not stop or rest on your laurels, but continue to implement structural reforms. Being a member of the club means pressing on with reform efforts and catching up with others.[end_answer] Croatia is entering the euro area during a crisis period, but the country is weathering this crisis successfully. So it is a matter of going ahead with that process, using all the advantages brought by membership of the euro area.[end_answer] Membership of the club will surely encourage and help the authorities to implement the reforms. The country will benefit from it.[end_answer] This is a rather technical but important issue. When a country joins the euro area, its national central bank (NCB) needs to contribute both to the ECB’s capital and to its foreign reserves according to thecapital key.[end_answer] The ECB foreign reserves are managed in a decentralised way by the euro area NCBs. The related income is recorded in the ECB’s profit and loss account, and will also benefit Hrvatska narodna banka, in addition to the other NCBs, who are shareholders of the ECB. Furthermore, each central bank is credited by the ECB with a euro claim equivalent to its contribution, which is remunerated by the ECB. Foreign reserve assets beyond this will remain on Hrvatska narodna banka’s balance sheet.[end_answer] According to theDecember Eurosystem staff projections, the recession we feared is likely to be short-lived and shallow. We revised down our GDP projections for 2023 from 0.9% previously, and we now expect 0.5% growth. However, 2024 and 2025 will see a recovery and a return to previous growth rates. All these projections are based on an assumption of no additional shocks or worsening of the difficulties we are facing. There is a big “if”, and in the past 12 months we have witnessed risks ultimately materialising. When it comes to inflation, projections for the entire horizon have been revised upward, which is also the reason for raising interest rates, as well as for anticipating further rate hikes. An important factor in this respect is that we must not allow inflationary expectations to become de-anchored or wages to have an inflationary effect. We know wages are increasing, probably at a faster pace than expected, but we must be wary that they do not start fuelling inflation.[end_answer] We have to take the necessary measures to return to our target inflation rate of 2%.[end_answer] We have to show resilience in the face of persistent inflation and we must be careful in considering not only its symptoms but also its roots. What is causing inflation? It used to be predominantly supply-side driven. But now we need to be careful that the domestic causes that we are seeing, which are mainly related to fiscal measures and wage dynamics, do not lead to inflation becoming entrenched.[end_answer] Our staff, that is the ECB in Frankfurt and 19 NCBs (soon to be 20 including Hrvatska narodna banka), do not forecast a deep recession. As I explained before, we forecast 0.5% GDP growth for next year and 1.9% and 1.8% for 2024 and 2025 respectively. These are the conclusions reached by economic experts based on comparisons and harmonisation of numerous data. Croatia will also take part in that process as of next year.[end_answer] First of all, I would like to say that I am very cautious when it comes to stories about birds. I have had the opportunity to see hawks turn into doves, doves turning into hawks... These are just stories. What matters is that the circumstances, the difficulties we are facing and the type of inflation we are fighting are inevitably changing people’s perspectives. All members of the Governing Council have different experiences and educational backgrounds, they come from different schools of thought and bring those views with them.[end_answer] How does the process work? There are discussions at both committee and Executive Board level in preparation for the monetary policy meeting. The ECB chief economist presents the proposal to the Governing Council. One key input is the staff projections by the ECB or in cooperation with euro area NCBs, which are prepared four times a year. Then, members of the Governing Council have a discussion on the proposal put forward by the chief economist. Following a lot of reflection and discussions among the members of the Governing Council we arrive at a decision, which becomes the monetary policy for the entire euro area. This is then presented by me and the Vice-President at a press conference. Afterwards the decisions are explained by members of the Governing Council in their own jurisdictions.[end_answer] Over a 24-year period, between 1999 and 2023, the euro area will have grown from 11 to 20 members, which is a clear indication that the club is attractive. Second, of the 27 Member States, with the exception of Denmark which has negotiated an opt-out, only six EU Member States are not members of the club. If they need more time, that is fine. When they meet the criteria and wish to join, we will be happy to increase the number of euro area countries, which is the ultimate goal of the Treaty.[end_answer] It is difficult to say, but it is probably a combination of both.","['curb inflation', 'inflation to become entrenched', 'anticipating further rate hikes', 'inflationary expectations to become de-anchored', 'inflationary effect',

439,2022-11-21,Interview with Market News,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2022/html/ecb.in221121~d42a5937c4.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 16 November 2022","What do you expect December’s Eurosystem growth and inflation projections to show?[end_question] A number of Governing Council members have recently expressed worries about second-round effects. How much of a concern, in terms of the inflation outlook, is pay growth?[end_question] What would you need to see to recommend raising rates by 75 basis points in December? Conversely, what would justify a smaller rate hike?[end_question] Would increasing rates above 2 per cent in December offer greater scope to slow the pace of interest rate hikes in the first quarter of 2023?[end_question] How likely is it that the ECB will stop – or pause – the hiking cycle either before or at the point when it begins quantitative tightening (QT)?[end_question] By how much would you expect QT to lower the terminal rate of interest?[end_question] The ECB has said that the expected shallow eurozone recession will not in itself be sufficient to bring inflation back to target. What is the sacrifice ratio that would?[end_question] Your colleague Mr Panetta warned earlier this week that the ECB must be alive to the dangers of excessive tightening, which he said could result in a permanent loss of output in response to persistently lower demand. Do you agree?[end_question] How happy are you currently with financial conditions across the eurozone?[end_question] Has the LDI fiasco in Britain affected your thinking in any way?[end_question] The European Commission is currently in the process of renegotiating EU fiscal rules. What bearing, if any, does that have for the outlook for monetary policy?[end_question] Last week the ECB changed its collateral rules, which saw asset swap spreads tighten. How much does this solve the problem?[end_question] So there shouldn't be any need, for example, to issue short-dated paper to relieve a year-end collateral squeeze?[end_question] Banks are pushing for the ECB to set up reverse repo operations, yet so far the bank has been hesitant to do so. Why? Is it under consideration?[end_question] Does the lower-than-expected US October inflation print have any bearing on expectations for the eurozone HICP outlook?[end_question] The German ZEW survey has just recorded a substantial rebound in expectations, although the outlook is still in negative territory, largely on the back of hopes that inflation will fall in the near future and monetary tightening will not be as severe as initially anticipated. Is this optimism justified?[end_question] So we might see, for want of a better word, some choppiness in near-term inflation expectations?[end_question] Across the euro area, corporate profits are soaring at the same time as an increasing number of households and businesses are struggling.[end_question] Disclaimer","21 November 2022[end_answer] The staff projections are going to cover 2023, 2024 and 2025. I think for 2023 the teams involved would have to take into account a number of factors. Number one, inflation is higher now than was expected in the last round. So the starting point for inflation is different compared to the last round. Over the course of the autumn it has become clear that next year energy prices are likely to remain higher than previously expected. Even though a lot of gas has been stored and we've had mild weather so far this winter, it's accepted that, based on the current outlook, the risks about gas supply are also going to be here next year. I think it's also clear that, at least in some countries, the pass-through of high energy wholesale prices to retail prices is not over. So we will see more of that. And in terms of fiscal policy, it looks like fiscal deficits are wider than foreseen in the September projection. So there is more fiscal support for the economy next year and that has inflation implications.[end_answer] For the medium term, looking into 2024, 2025, I think there are really two big issues. One is that it's clear that wages are set to increase more strongly than normal. We already saw in the September projection that there will be several years of nominal wages growing more quickly, because workers have experienced a significant loss in their real wages. We do expect this kind of catch-up process to drive nominal wages higher over several years. And, as we already had in September, there will have to be a kind of reassessment of the wage outlook in the context of the higher inflation rates, the status of the labour market and the fiscal support that is still there.[end_answer] The other factor that's going to be relevant for 2024-25 is the feedback loop. There's been a big jump in the yield curve and it's starting to pass through to bank lending conditions. Even if this does not have an immediate effect on the economy and on inflation, we would expect to see it kicking in more strongly in 2024 and 2025.[end_answer] So for those years the forecast will have to balance the fact that inflation has a knock-on effect, for example, on the wage mechanism. But on the other hand, we do have the fact that the financial conditions are far different than what we had going into the September forecast.[end_answer] This year we’ve had a very large increase in the price level, so there's been a very big drop in living standards. At the same time unemployment in historical terms is quite low. So even if the European economy experiences stagnation or a mild recession later this year and at the start of next year, it still has quite a lot of support for ongoing growth. Even if the energy shock levels out next year – so it's no longer a source of inflation, and even if globally bottlenecks are easing – so the pressure from global commodity prices and global goods prices also levels off: there's still going to be an inflation dynamic in 2024-25.[end_answer] Labour costs are a big fraction of the domestic component of inflation. But then the question is: how long is that going to be for? And as I said earlier on: it's going to be stronger than the historical average, because workers will be trying to rebuild living standards. But how much and for how long labour costs will contribute to domestic inflation remains open and is a source of high uncertainty. There will be some calculation in the December projections, but month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter, over the next year, this is going to be one of the key issues we're going to watch. I don't think we're going to have a conclusive answer next year.[end_answer] But there is a very important feedback loop here, which is also relevant for the decisions by firms. We've done a good amount of monetary policy normalisation, and we gave a clear signal that we will continue to raise rates until we have reached a level that will make sure inflation comes back to 2 per cent in a timely manner. Firms and workers should understand that price and wage-setting should take place in the context that the more expensive financial conditions will dampen demand next year and in the years after that. Firms should be careful about excessively raising mark-ups, and workers should be careful about what a sustainable wage increase is. There is an important interaction between what we do and how these price and wage decisions are set. Another way of saying this is that firms and workers should fully understand that inflation is going to come down over these years towards our 2 per cent target.[end_answer] We said in our recent meetings – and we did so again in October – that we expect to raise rates further. It's usually neither necessary nor wise to try and jump immediately to your target rate. In December we will make another hike and the scale of it should continue to make progress towards the levels needed. But it’s not necessary to conceive completing that transition in December. Each meeting is different. But one platform for considering a very large hike, such as 75 basis points, is no longer there. When we were at zero, that did not correspond to anyone's idea of the interest rate level necessary. Going to 1.5 per cent is still below where we need to go. But the more you've already done on a cumulative basis, that changes the pros and cons of any given increment. We will have to look at it in terms of the inflation outlook that we have in December and take into account that we are at a different point now, and also to recognise that there are lags in the transmission process.[end_answer] I am not going to comment on the exact level at any one meeting. Clearly, there’s a connection: the higher the level of the interest rate, the smaller the remaining gap to the target rate. What matters is the level we're going to arrive at. The exact allocation across different meetings is a secondary issue. But the more we've already done, the less we need to do.[end_answer] I don't think December is going to be the last rate hike. Trying to jump forward to February, to March, to May or June next year, I think it’s too early to have very strong views at this point. The logic of a pause for the ECB: we’re not at that point. The more relevant argument than whether to pause is to move at the appropriate time to smaller increments. And then, eventually, you get to a point, where, essentially you say: okay, we're at the level where it's probably going to be wise to hold at this level for a while but also signal that we will be open to do more if needed, because we are living under high uncertainty.[end_answer] Then let me come to the second part of your question, about QT. We shouldn't interconnect the issue so much. What is clear is that you want to make decent progress on raising the policy rate before you start mapping out QT. And by December, we will have made decent progress on that. We said that we will lay out a roadmap, general principles in December. The roadmap will subsequently convert into a more precise plan that will allow for the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio to decline at a certain pace in the coming months. But I don't think we're going to be on a meeting-by-meeting basis interconnecting the interest rate decision with the pace for the next month or two. It should be probably more mechanical than that. I think that's a pretty basic principle.[end_answer] I wouldn't approach the question like that, because there's no scenario in which we keep the APP at its current level. Of course, if you don’t scale down the APP portfolio, the policy rate would have to be higher – there is a substitution effect there. But the market does expect some degree of runoff of the APP, and that is already reflected in the yield curve. So the calibration of the APP schedule has to perform two objectives. One is to contribute to the overall stance by essentially reversing the kind of compression of term premia that quantitative easing (QE) did; and the other is to make sure that this is done in an orderly way, because we have to allow for the market to adjust.[end_answer] We have to remember where we are. There's going to be a fairly large reduction in the inflation rates simply through base effects. But even if that reduces the inflation rate, it still leaves the cost of living permanently higher. So the price level is very important for wage dynamics. Going back to the monetary policy issue, we have to think about where inflation is headed in 2024-25 and what the distance is to our 2 per cent target. We also have to take into account what's already happened. The yield curve is higher, we see adjustments in bond markets and we see bank lending rates going up. More expensive financing conditions will mean a lower level of demand. That will mean a lower level of GDP and a lower level of employment. But the labour market has two margins at the moment: one is unemployment, the other is vacancies. You could have a slowdown in the economy, where one part of adjustment will be fewer vacancies. And with fewer vacancies, wage pressure will go down. And if you don't have the option to move to a new job, then wage bargaining changes. It could also be the case that firms opt to hold on to workers and there is a degree of labour hoarding. Under those circumstances unemployment may not rise as much as in previous cycles. I would say we would expect unemployment to go up as well, that is true, but in the context of levels that right now are historically quite low.[end_answer] We are absolutely clear and we have a primary mandate that we will get to our target in a timely manner. But it has always been the case and always will be the case that we want to do it in a way that minimises the side effects in terms of lower output and higher unemployment. The history of recessions does indicate that they tend to leave a long-term footprint. But what's also true is that there's an appreciation that the balancing act requires us to avoid under-tightening. Because if you under-tighten, inflation remains too high for too long, and then in turn you may end up having a bigger recession later on, with a bigger permanent drop in output.[end_answer] We currently do think that any recession will be mild and short-lived. But you can definitely construct scenarios where that recession gets bigger and longer. And if you have rising credit risk, then you will have financial tightening coming from the decline in the economy, and that will be important. Financial conditions in the euro area also interconnect with financial conditions globally. And with other central banks also tightening, you'd have to think about that spillover. If tightening in the rest of the world leads to lower global inflation pressures, lower commodity prices, lower pressure on tradeable goods prices, then the inflation forecast could improve for international reasons in addition to domestic reasons. This all goes back to why we are taking a meeting-by-meeting approach. We are giving a kind of directional orientation that we have more to do. But in terms of the exact scale of what we need to do, it would be a mistake to be overly fixated in either direction.[end_answer] What we see this year is a sharp change in the inflation outlook, which in turn led to a sizeable revision in monetary policies around the world. And, of course, the whole financial system is going to take time to absorb that. We would call on everyone to recognise that we're in a new environment and to manage those risks. I was involved myself in previous reports about what happens if you move away from the low-for-longer environment, so I think that the risk factors are clear. But in terms of where we actually are, I think the adjustment so far has been very much within the lines of reverting to normal rather than creating historically tight conditions.[end_answer] Maybe it sends out two signals: I think there’s a clear message for governments everywhere that it's very important to have fiscal strategies that are clearly anchored in debt sustainability and in making sure debt ratios are on a downward path. Second, we have to be vigilant for pockets of the markets that may have been taken by surprise. But let me again emphasise here that what we have is a kind of smooth adjustment so far to a very different environment.[end_answer] Before the energy shock, this year the Commission would have forecast a pretty big drop in debt and deficit ratios in the coming years. There has been an improvement this year because a lot of the pandemic programmes have been stopped and we've seen the recovery in the economy, which has boosted tax revenues. This has allowed a lot of energy programmes to be launched, a lot of which are temporary in nature. One of the big issues, I think, for the coming year, is to make sure that these interventions are temporary and targeted, and are basically embedded in a larger strategy of making sure debt ratios, especially for the high-debt countries, are firmly on a downward path. I think everyone shares this analysis. But what is true is that having fiscal deficits that remain relatively high will support demand in the economy and add to medium-term inflation pressures. Everyone has to really look at this quite carefully, because a lot of the fiscal programmes right now are basically transfers to households or to firms. And the multiplier on transfers is lower than on government consumption or government investment. A lot of people who receive these transfers may just save them, so it’s not clear whether it will result in the same boost to aggregate demand.[end_answer] I think there are three factors here. One is the increase in our securities lending facility. The second is: the German debt management office has also announced measures. And the third is the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) decision we took in October, which will also release collateral back into the system. Of course, we'll always be attentive to market functioning and collateral scarcity issues. I would mention, also, that governments will still be issuing quite a lot of debt, and we're not going to be net purchasers, so the amount of collateral coming into the market from that source will also ease pressures.[end_answer] We will always be vigilant, but I think the measures we've put in place will be sufficient.[end_answer] First, the ECB always thinks about everything all the time, so there's no informational value in saying something is “under consideration”. The ECB always has a range of options for how it can manage its liquidity but I think the decisions we made last week will suffice. Also, we always have to think about the differences between the euro area, which remains very decentralised, and the American financial system. The Fed has a particular approach, but it’s not necessarily the best approach for us.[end_answer] One month of data does not constitute a trend, so let’s be cautious about this, we need a longer horizon. But if it turns out to be the case that there is a trend, there are basically two forces behind it. One is a decline in global inflation pressure, which will also benefit the euro area by lowering pressure on import prices. The other element could be a decline in domestic inflation. And we saw that, in fact, services inflation came down as well. That could suggest that the United States is now making progress in its adjustment, and of course that would be good news for the world economy and for us.[end_answer] A lot has been done to preserve energy supplies this winter, whether that's the filling up of gas storage or many firms – and indeed many households – reducing energy consumption. Clearly, compared to worst-case scenarios, this has led to a degree of confidence building for the near term. On our side, I do think that what we've done has helped – in the sense of ending the QE programmes and the by-now sizeable and repeated increases in policy rates – the actions we take demonstrate that there will be downward pressure on inflation.[end_answer] Then you come to the near term and that's where we should take into account that there is a lot of inflation pressure remaining in the pipeline, but this differs across countries. In some countries, Spain for example, energy inflation may have come down primarily because a lot of the adjustment happened a year ago. For other countries with longer-term contracts for energy, the pass-through to retail prices is ongoing. Sooner rather than later, the accumulated pass-through will convert into downward pressure on inflation, but let’s see whether the peak turns out to be this side of Christmas or the other.[end_answer] Around March, after the war started, there was a pick-up in consumer expectations. But they have been relatively stable in recent months. They haven't improved, but they haven't deteriorated either. I would say that these days my focus is on three levels. Historically, there would have been a kind of differentiation between short term and long term. But actually, I think the medium term is quite important. I do think, by and large, across all types of surveys and market indicators, people believe that over a longer horizon, inflation will get back to 2 per cent. People also understand that in the near term, over the next number of months, inflation is going to be elevated compared to our targets. But the important issue for us is the two-way feedback loop between medium-term expectations. Where do people think inflation will be in 2023, 2024, 2025? That will influence pricing decisions and wage decisions, while also recognising that these medium-term inflation expectations clearly will also be influenced by our decisions.[end_answer] There isn't a universal message here. In some sectors, where demand was surprisingly strong this year, it is clear that one major source of inflation was not cost increases: it was firms responding to high demand compared to supply by raising mark-ups. A second category is clearly some types of energy firms which are generating windfall profits. There's a third category of firms which are suffering because they have very high energy bills, demand may not be particularly strong, and for those firms the profit margins are being squeezed. The message here is not so much for those firms but for the firms where mark-ups are currently high. These firms should be paying attention to the macroeconomic situation, to our policy, to the fact that demand conditions will be tighter next year. I am thinking about the tourism industry, for example, or the restaurant industry, all sorts of industries, which benefited from reopening this year. It will be very important to recognise demand conditions will be tighter and it would be a mistake to seek to preserve very high mark-ups in that scenario.","['inflation is higher', 'starting point for inflation', 'inflation implications.', 'higher inflation rates', 'immediate effect on the economy and on inflation', 'it kicking in more strongly', 'inflation has a knock-on effect', 'inflation dynamic', 'domestic component of inflation.', 'domestic inflation', 'inflation comes back', 'inflation is going to come down', 'large reduction in the inflation rates', 'reduces the inflation rate', 'inflation is headed', 'inflation remains too high for too long', 'lower global inflation pressures', 'medium-term inflation pressures.', 'global inflation pressure', 'decline in domestic inflation', 'inflation came down', 'downward pressure on inflation', 'inflation pressure', 'energy inflation may have come down', 'downward pressure on inflation', ' inflation will get back', 'inflation is going to be elevated']","['Number one, inflation is higher now than was expected in the last round.', 'So the starting point for inflation is different compared to the last round.', 'So there is more fiscal support for the economy next year and that has inflation implications.', 'And, as we already had in September, there will have to be a kind of reassessment of the wage outlook in the context of the higher inflation rates, the status of the labour market and the fiscal support that is still there.', 'Even if this does not have an immediate effect on the economy and on inflation, we would expect to see it kicking in more strongly in 2024 and 2025.', 'Even if this does not have an immediate effect on the economy and on inflation, we would expect to see it kicking in more strongly in 2024 and 2025.', 'So for those years the forecast will have to balance the fact that inflation has a knock-on effect, for example, on the wage mechanism.', ""Even if the energy shock levels out next year – so it's no longer a source of inflation, and even if globally bottlenecks are easing – so the pressure from global commodity prices and global goods prices also levels off: there's still going to be an inflation dynamic in 2024-25."", 'Labour costs are a big fraction of the domestic component of inflation.', 'But how much and for how long labour costs will contribute to domestic inflation remains open and is a source of high uncertainty.', 'We gave a clear signal that we will continue to raise rates until we have reached a level that will make sure inflation comes back to 2 per cent in a timely manner.', 'Another way of saying this is that firms and workers should fully understand that inflation is going to come down over these years towards our 2 per cent target.', ""There's going to be a fairly large reduction in the inflation rates simply through base effects.

444,2022-09-22,Interview with t-online,Isabel Schnabel,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2022/html/ecb.in220922~0f586d9078.en.html,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Florian Schmidt on 15 September 2022","Ms Schnabel, you come from Dortmund, a city of hard workers, or “Malocher” as they are referred to locally. How often do you think about these people in the context of high inflation?[end_question] Inflation in Germany was 7.9% in August. Are we ever going to see it go down?[end_question] Why?[end_question] How much time?[end_question] So when is it going to fall again?[end_question] In other words, you will continue to miss your inflation target for more than a year still. Have you failed?[end_question] Much too late, according to critics.[end_question] Some economists warned about higher inflation as early as spring. Why were ECB experts so wrong?[end_question] The most recent interest rate hike was the largest in the ECB’s history. Some people are now worried this could choke off the economy. Which is worse: inflation or recession?[end_question] So economic development doesn’t matter for you?[end_question] Will that happen at the next meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council at the end of October already?[end_question] The ifo Institute expects Germany to face a “winter recession”? Do you expect that too?[end_question] Will that also cause mass layoffs?[end_question] Does that mean things might not be so bad after all?[end_question] That may in turn result in high inflation becoming ingrained in the minds of many people. How much does that concern you?[end_question] And why should people believe you, now of all times?[end_question] But what happens if that doesn’t work – and if people nonetheless expect persistently high rates of inflation?[end_question] Really? In the current round of wage negotiations, the German metalworkers’ trade union IG Metall alone is demanding a huge wage hike of 8.2%.[end_question] So a one-off agreement between employers and employees on a substantial increase would not automatically push up inflation?[end_question] The governments of Europe are now deploying an array of instruments in an attempt to relieve the pressure on their citizens. Can the use of such instruments make up for the loss of wealth?[end_question] How so?[end_question] Where do you yourself notice this at the moment?[end_question] And what do you cut back on in your daily life?[end_question] In conclusion let’s turn to Italy, where the anti-EU candidate Giorgia Meloni of the far-right party Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) could become prime minister next Sunday. How concerned are you about that?[end_question] The level of government debt also differs. Italy has a very high level and will suffer correspondingly in the future from a rise in interest rates.[end_question] Ms Schnabel, many thanks for this interview.[end_question] Disclaimer","22 September 2022[end_answer] Many people are worried that they won’t be able to pay their energy bills. Some even struggle to pay for food at the end of the month because prices are rising so much. This is of great concern to me because we at the ECB are responsible for price stability in the euro area. It is our task to ensure that annual inflation is at 2% over the medium term. Right now we are far away from our target – inflation is much too high.[end_answer] Yes, but not immediately, unfortunately. Current inflation is mostly driven by a strong increase in energy prices. Another factor is the pandemic-related disruption to supply chains, which is making many products more expensive. We are also seeing food prices growing significantly around the world. Our monetary policy has little impact on what is happening on global commodity markets.[end_answer] The ECB’s monetary policy affects inflation mainly through demand. When interest rates increase, loans become more expensive and saving becomes more attractive. This lowers the demand for products – both from consumers, who spend less, and firms, which invest less. Companies can then no longer hike their prices so quickly because there are fewer people who want their products. As a result, inflation falls. But this takes time.[end_answer] Probably a while still. Inflation may continue growing in the short term, despite the recent interest rate hikes.[end_answer] According to our projections, it will take until 2024 for inflation to stabilise around our 2% target.[end_answer] As I said, current inflation is in large part due to factors we cannot influence directly. The war in Ukraine exacerbates the situation. It weighs on economic growth and drives inflation further up. But we have normalised our monetary policy step-by-step already since December of last year. First, we stopped additional purchases of government bonds. Then, since July, we have increased the policy rates twice significantly, leaving negative and zero interest rates behind. In early September we even hiked rates by 0.75 percentage points. This sent out an important signal: We are doing whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our 2% target.[end_answer] In anticipation of our measures, the interest rates in financial markets have started to rise much earlier, and they rose very fast. It is also worth remembering that ever since the pandemic started, we have been facing enormous uncertainty. When the Omicron wave hit last winter, we didn’t know whether we could be looking at widespread lockdowns once again. In the spring, it was impossible to say what impact the war would have on economic developments and inflation. In the view of the ECB’s Governing Council, the steps taken to reach our medium-term inflation target were appropriate at the time.[end_answer] With the benefit of hindsight we can have a discussion about whether we should have acted a little sooner. But now the interest rate turnaround has started. We are on the right track.[end_answer] The ECB has a clear mandate – price stability. The signal we sent with our latest interest rate hike is clear: we are taking decisive steps to curb inflation and are making sure that it stabilises again at 2% in the medium term.[end_answer] A looming downturn would have a dampening effect on inflation. Of course, we take this into account when calibrating our monetary policy. However, the starting point of interest rates is very low, so it is clear that we need to continue raising rates.[end_answer] I’m expecting that the ECB’s Governing Council will continue to increase interest rates at its next meeting. What I cannot say is how big this hike will be or at what level we will stop increasing rates. We are deciding meeting by meeting, based on an assessment of all the economic and inflation data.[end_answer] For the euro area as a whole we are currently expecting an economic stagnation rather than a recession. Unfortunately, the situation in Germany is worse. Owing to its strong dependency on Russian gas, Germany has been especially hard hit. A recession may potentially be unavoidable here.[end_answer] The labour market has proven to be very robust so far. The unemployment rate in the euro area is at a historical low; many countries, Germany included, are even experiencing a shortage of labour. Many firms may deem it in their interest to retain their staff despite challenging business conditions.[end_answer] Hopefully, most workers will keep their jobs. But people will nonetheless feel the effects of the high prices, especially those on low incomes, because wages are not keeping pace with the rise in prices.[end_answer] Inflation expectations play a crucial role in our decisions. We see with some concern that more people expect inflation to exceed our 2% target also in the medium term. This makes it all the more important to send clear signals that people can rely on the ECB and that inflation will go down again.[end_answer] Because the ECB has shown repeatedly in the past that it responds appropriately to economic developments. We acted decisively at times when inflation was too low, and during the coronavirus pandemic we contributed significantly to Europe emerging from this severe crisis in good shape economically. In this way we showed that citizens can rely on the central bank. People can trust us; we will fulfil our mandate and ensure price stability.[end_answer] One danger is the emergence of a wage-price spiral. If employees, against the backdrop of rising inflation expectations, demand very high wage increases and businesses then pass these on through even higher prices, wages and prices can drive each other up. But we see no signs of that happening at present. Wage growth has increased, but it is still moderate.[end_answer] So far, wage agreements are nowhere near keeping pace with inflation. Price-adjusted wages are falling, meaning that purchasing power is declining.[end_answer] We need to avoid that people expect permanently high inflation. That is why we are closely monitoring wage growth dynamics.[end_answer] Higher energy prices are making Europe poorer. We have to transfer a larger share of our income abroad to pay for energy imports. Governments can’t do anything to change that in the short term. However, they can take targeted measures to ease particular hardships and prepare for the future. To this end, politicians should not disregard the effects of prices on behaviour. At the end of the day, higher energy prices will help us become less dependent on fossil fuels and thus achieve our climate targets. Moreover, investments are required in order to speed up the transition to renewable energies. When designing fiscal support programmes, care should be taken that they do not further fuel inflation.[end_answer] Government relief measures for the broad mass of the population could stimulate demand and push up inflation. We might then have to raise interest rates even more. From a political perspective it may be favourable to appeal to a large share of the electorate with a package of relief measures. But it should always be at the back of our minds that, in the long term, we will have to collectively bear these costs.[end_answer] I am able to cope with the current situation. People with higher incomes and wealth will of course be less well off too, but they can more easily draw on their savings to cushion the effects.[end_answer] First and foremost I try to lower my energy consumption. Not only to save money, but also for environmental reasons.[end_answer] We never comment on political developments in individual countries. The ECB is independent and conducts monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. That is why we are guided by inflation in the euro area, even if the situation naturally differs from one country to another.[end_answer] A country’s ability to service its debt hinges fundamentally on its economic growth. That means that countries must get on a sustainable growth path. The European support package Next Generation EU, which was introduced during the pandemic, plays a significant role in this respect. It’s very important that the growth projects, which are financed through this programme, are pursued consistently and fully implemented. That is a task for national governments. But we are all in the same boat. That’s why it’s important to also develop common solutions at European level in order to overcome the current crisis.","['inflation is much too high', 'inflation is mostly driven by', 'inflation

451,2022-05-30,Interview with Cinco Días,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2022/html/ecb.in220530~bc5cf9621c.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Nuño Rodrigo and Laura Salces on 25 May 2022","What has happened in the ECB’s Governing Council during the past few weeks? This week President Lagarde has signalled a shift from indicating a rate increase some time after the end of asset purchases to two rate hikes by the end of September.[end_question] It is unusual for the President of the ECB to provide such a clear roadmap. Does the ECB feel under pressure to act?[end_question] Could there be a 50-basis point hike in the July meeting?[end_question] The current nature of inflation creates a dilemma: some people think the rate hike will come too late, whereas others think it’s not so urgent, as the inflation is driven by the supply side rather than the demand side. What do you think?[end_question] Is the depreciation of the euro a factor in the recent update to the roadmap?[end_question] Will there be an upward revision to inflation projections and a downward revision to growth expectations in June? The most recent projections were published just two weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine.[end_question] Are we now closer to the adverse inflation scenario that you talked about in March – of 7.1 per cent this year?[end_question] Is there a risk of recession in 2023 or later? The ECB is going to raise rates, and this risks damaging growth.[end_question] What would be the neutral interest rate for the eurozone?[end_question] Sovereign bond yields are rising rapidly, and risk premia too. Is there reason to be worried about the risk of financial fragmentation?[end_question] In 2012 Mario Draghi wasn’t talking about fragmentation but about redenomination risk. The yields of Spanish and Italian bonds were very different to what they are now but, in terms of market fragmentation, where is the pain threshold?[end_question] Does the ECB need a contingency tool to address this risk of financial fragmentation? Or can you address it just by adjusting the PEPP reinvestments?[end_question] Spain and Italy are among the most vulnerable countries in the euro area. Are we prepared to weather higher financing costs?[end_question] What do you think of the suspension of the fiscal rules for this year and 2023?[end_question] Just like monetary policy?[end_question] You mentioned some tailwinds, especially for the Spanish economy, like tourism and the Next Generation EU funds. What are the headwinds that the ECB is working against?[end_question] Crypto-assets have undergone a severe correction, a drop which comes at the same time as the ECB’s warnings about their correlation with the financial sector. How big is the threat to financial stability?[end_question] What are your greatest concerns about crypto-assets?[end_question] Could what has happened with digital assets harm the development of the digital euro?[end_question] What’s the time frame for the digital euro?[end_question] The pandemic and now the war in Ukraine are causing huge changes in the economic and geopolitical landscape. How do you think the euro area is prepared for this new world?[end_question] Disclaimer","30 May 2022[end_answer] As we have always said, there is a clear sequence. The fulfilment of the conditions to end asset purchases in the third quarter, which starts in July, has become increasingly clear. And the next step sets up the expectation of when to raise rates and what the increases will look like.I think it was important for President Lagarde to lay out aroadmapsignalling the end of net asset purchases in July and the end of negative interest rates in September. It is a robust and appropriate decision, although it is too early to know what will happen after that, as it will depend on how the economy evolves.[end_answer] It is important for people to understand our thinking. The two months between the April and June meetings were probably too long not to give any guidance. I think it was very good timing for President Lagarde to lay out a roadmap. The roadmap includes ending quantitative easing at the start of the third quarter and then two rate increases in July and September, so that by the end of the third quarter we have moved out of negative rates. Of course, we have meetings coming up in June, July and September, but given the high uncertainty we’re facing, it is important to set good expectations.[end_answer] What we see today is that it is appropriate to move out of negative rates by the end of the third quarter, and that the process should be gradual. Normalisation has a natural focus on moving in units of 25 basis points, so increases of 25 basis points in the July and September meetings are a benchmark pace. Any discussion about other moves would have to make the case for moving more strongly than this sequence of hikes in July and September. The discussion will be had, but our current assessment of the situation, where we think the medium-term inflation outlook is in line with our two per cent target, calls for a gradual approach to normalisation.[end_answer] Our roadmap is robust and covers a range of different interpretations of what’s going on – on one side, the view that inflation is exclusively due to a supply shock and, on the other, the view of those who believe that there is a big domestic demand component.Moving out of negative rates in September makes sense under either interpretation. This debate will continue in the autumn, and at that point we’ll have more information and will know more about the dynamic of inflation and second-round effects on wages. With more time, we will find out more about the balance between supply and demand, between temporary and longer-term factors. Taking the first steps is appropriate under a range of hypotheses, and we will know more over the coming months about the next steps after that.[end_answer] There has been a movement against the US dollar but there have also been opposing movements against other currencies, so on a trade-weighted basis the euro has moved much less. But regardless, the exchange rate is very important for the euro area economy and for its exporting firms, including those in Spain. But it would be a mistake to only focus on one of the factors affecting import prices. The exchange rate matters in many ways, so we consider it in our projections, together with all the other factors that are shaping the economy.[end_answer] The impact of the war is becoming increasingly visible in the European Commission’s recent projections and those of other economic institutions. In the near term, directionally, there is an upward pressure on inflation and a negative impact on growth. But for monetary policy, how we assess the medium term is very important, so not only 2022 but also 2023 and 2024. We need to go beyond the immediate impact and analyse the medium-term effects of factors like high prices today leading to lower incomes and lower demand.[end_answer] I don’t think that’s the way to look at it. The baseline scenario changes with each set of quarterly projections. In June we will have an updated baseline, which will reflect all the factors that affect the economy. We take into account the uncertainty created by the war, which is weighing on GDP, as well as the recovery from the pandemic. It’s important to remember that all the factors are at work, rather than just focusing on one element.[end_answer] The European Commission has already significantly downgraded growth for this year. But because of the recovery from the pandemic, there is a natural momentum in the economy. The euro area economy is still projected to grow, although at a slower rate than was expected. Even without a recession the war is having a sizeable impact on the euro area. In any case, we are moving towards a normalisation of monetary policies that were introduced to fight excessively-low inflation. It is more a withdrawal of stimulus than a monetary tightening. Monetary policy is still going to be supportive. Moving out of negative rates in September does not mean that interest rates are going to be high – these are still going to be relatively supportive. It’s a pathway to normalisation.[end_answer] The ECB would look at this, of course, like many others. There are calculations of the equilibrium real interest rates. As you can see in previous speeches I have given, but also others, these are projected to be very low, negative in many calculations and around zero in others. I appreciate that investors want to predict where the neutral interest rate will be, but for us as a central bank the important focus is on a pathway where essentially we will be moving rates and then we’ll be simultaneously assessing the inflation dynamic. Rates will settle down when inflation settles around two per cent, and we should be open-minded where that will be. We’re going meeting by meeting, quarter by quarter. As President Lagarde has said, we can move more quickly if inflation pressures are high and more slowly if there are downside risks to inflation. So that’s our focus, not the academic debate on where the so-called neutral interest rate is. And if you look at the history of monetary policy, this approach reflects a more normal monetary policy situation.[end_answer] In December we essentially started normalisation by confirming that net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) would end in March. And we were already explicit at the time that we would be flexible in our monetary policy in the future. We are not going to ignore fragmentation risk – clearly, we know it is something that was very damaging in the past. We are monitoring fragmentation risk continuously and, within our mandate, we are committed to preventing it.[end_answer] I think the pain threshold in terms of risk premia has to be evaluated in the particular circumstances we find ourselves in. It’s not as simple as giving a fixed number at which point we would intervene. We have to always be monitoring what is going on, assessing the sources of movements in yields and the basis for intervention.[end_answer] In the last Governing Council meeting we said that we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term. Flexibility is a general concept. One application is through the PEPP reinvestments, but there are also other instruments that could be used. The debate about what type of instrument could be used is a secondary one – the bottom line is the commitment that we will not let unwarranted impairment of the transmission mechanism interfere with monetary policy and our ability to deliver our target.[end_answer] The Spanish and Italian economies are stronger than they were ten years ago. There has been a very significant recovery. Over the medium term it’s difficult to overstate the impact of the Next Generation EU funds, which will be a very important anchor for economic activity. Another recovery path is through the normalisation of tourism, and here Spain and Italy will be among the countries that benefit the most. Also, across Europe, we are not witnessing the very severe imbalances seen during the financial crisis. We also talked about the equilibrium interest rate. The market is not expecting interest rates to return anywhere near those levels that were problematic in that period.[end_answer] The European Commission’s baseline scenario is that the euro area economy will be growing this year and next. But there are risks that the situation might deteriorate owing to the war, and so it makes sense for the escape clause to be extended for another year. This does not mean that fiscal policy should be loosened – it’s more a question of risk management. And remember that many programmes that were launched during the pandemic are now finishing and tax revenue is expected to recover, which should lead to an improvement in fiscal positions.[end_answer] When the war is over and the uncertainty fades, we will have to make sure that there is a clear framework to reduce debt ratios gradually. By and large, fiscal policy should be moving towards a neutral setting under the baseline.[end_answer] Yes, essentially. Many private sector activities were restricted during the pandemic, and these should be recovering now. We are in a world where fiscal policy can step back a little bit.[end_answer] Internally, the energy shock is a big challenge for Europe, which imports a lot of energy. Collectively, Europe has less disposable income, and that means lower demand for many sectors. And externally, the uncertainty about the evolution of the world economy and the war in Ukraine is a risk factor.[end_answer] The assessment is that the European financial system is not overexposed to cryptocurrencies. But we should prepare, and that’s why having regulation and providing more information to consumers is important. The sharp fall in crypto-assets is a wake-up call for many investors who had speculated in some of these products and experienced significant losses.[end_answer] Our diagnosis is essentially that everything that has happened recently is due to pure speculation. What we have now are new technologies, which may be promising but highly volatile in a world with no regulation. We need to develop good regulation for digital finance. A digital euro, issued by a central bank, would allow many of these technologies to play a very beneficial and regulated role.[end_answer] No, I don’t think so. These are different concepts. The narrative that a private sector invention can replace the official currency of a state just doesn’t hold up. The digital euro would be one-to-one with cash and with money in the commercial banking system, which is entirely different to some kind of engineered product that relies on some algorithm or imperfect mechanism.[end_answer] We’re in an investigation phase now, but it’s a process that could take around five years.A clearer roadmap, which we should have sooner rather than later, will be helpful for everyone involved in the project. We have to make the right decisions, and this also involves the European Commission and the Member States.[end_answer] Having a single currency is extremely beneficial. It’s a very effective way of dealing with these global shocks, and very different to each country having to cope with the pandemic or the war in Ukraine by itself. Europeans appreciate that it’s important to have a common currency and to take collective decisions. Europe should be able to make its own decisions. And the ECB can deliver this. Thanks to the euro, we have a great deal of control to deliver price stability and to contribute to the objectives of the European Union.","['inflation outlook is in line', 'upward pressure on inflation', 'fight excessively-low inflation', 'inflation settles around', 'inflation pressures', 'risks to inflation', 'inflation stabilises']","['The discussion will be had, but our current assessment of the situation, where we think the medium-term inflation outlook is in line with our two per cent target, calls for a gradual approach to normalisation.', 'In the near term, directionally, there is an upward pressure on inflation and a negative impact on growth.', 'In any case, we are moving towards a normalisation of monetary policies that were introduced to fight excessively-low inflation.', 'Rates will settle down when inflation settles around two per cent, and we should be open-minded where that will be.

Global shocks that have emerged on the way out of the pandemic – surging energy prices and supply bottlenecks – have been exacerbated by the invasion of Ukraine. Tensions have become persistent and more acute: inflation is rising while economic activity is showing signs of slowing. This makes the choices facing the European Central Bank more complicated, as a monetary tightening aimed at containing inflation would end up hampering growth that is already weakening.[end_answer] The European economy is de facto stagnating.Growth in the first quarter was 0.2%, and would have essentially been zero without what may have partly been one-off spikes in growth in certain countries. The major economies are suffering – GDP growth has slowed in Spain, halted in France and contracted in Italy. In Germany growth momentum is low and has been weakening since the end of February, which is the point when everything changed.[end_answer] Yes. And we should not lose sight of the fact that inflation is being fuelled by international factors that are reducing purchasing power and weakening consumer demand and investment. Monetary policy has only limited room to affect this imported inflation. The drivers of inflation are global, not European.[end_answer] The exchange rate is determined by the market. Moreover, the shocks we are facing are so large that a few percentage points of appreciation in the exchange rate would have limited impact. Not to mention that a strong euro would weigh on foreign demand, squeezing growth further.[end_answer] First of all, we need to gain a comprehensive understanding. At present, we do not have the hard data necessary to accurately assess the war’s impact on demand and growth. We are talking about potentially large effects: the reduction in euro area income due to increased import prices amounts to 3.5% of GDP, or about €450 billion. The evolution of GDP in the first quarter reflects only partially the impact of the war. We have to wait for the second quarter figures to get a clear picture. Our monetary policy is data driven, and we cannot make decisions before we have seen the figures.[end_answer] We must be prudent, recognising what we can do, but also what we cannot do. We can and must prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy, which would lead to price increases that we saw as temporary becoming a structural and permanent phenomenon. We would react decisively, for example, if we observed a deterioration in inflation expectations or wage increases that were inconsistent with our 2% inflation target over the medium term. There is no clear evidence that this is happening, but we cannot ignore the risk that it might.[end_answer] We cannot tame inflation on our own without causing high costs for the economy. We need to act on multiple fronts, not just through monetary policy.[end_answer] The international community has a duty to work to stop the war and to end the atrocities taking place in Ukraine. But supporting Ukraine and doing all we can so that the war ends quickly is also the best way to quickly reduce inflation. Peace would ease tensions in international markets (oil, gas and food) that are driving up inflation.[end_answer] We all hope that the war will be brought to a swift end through diplomatic means, to stop any more lives from being lost. But if that does not happen, I think we should help the Ukrainians in the way they best see fit, including helping them to defend themselves. And we should support their economy.[end_answer] It’s not just about weapons. There is diplomacy and there is economic support. For instance, there is the issue of food exports: the destruction of infrastructure and freight capacity in Ukraine will have an impact on the world’s supply of wheat and grain. We need to assist Ukrainians with logistics, and help preserve their capacity to export in spite of the Russian maritime blockade and increasing damage to key transport infrastructure. We are already doing this: the EU has suspended all duties on imports from Ukraine and is facilitating the use of EU infrastructure to deliver Ukrainian exports to third countries. But we can do more and achieve important results, for them and for ourselves.[end_answer] We need to strengthen European cooperation. If we want to respond to global tensions, we need a “European shield”. This means coordinating our policies on energy – for example to reduce dependency on Russia – and on food imports. This also means coordinating our fiscal measures to contain the costs of imported inflation. We must implement the agreements made at the Versailles summit in March: in pursuing “open strategic autonomy” we can make value chains safer, diversifying them within the Union. Take for example the opportunities that could be opened by transferring certain production activities to less developed regions of Europe, such as the South of Italy, attracting the capital that is moving away from those countries that are now considered riskier by global investors.[end_answer] I've been saying this for some time. The pandemic and the war have opened our eyes to the risks, and not just the benefits, of relocating production sites in areas far away from where we are. The South of Italy is safer and more competitive than other parts of the world. Particularly if this relocation can be realised in the context of a European project aimed at stimulating the creation of regional value chains.[end_answer] With medium-term actual and expected inflation around 2% we can gradually reduce the level of monetary accommodation, providing less stimulus to the economy than in the past. Under current circumstances, negative rates and net asset purchases may no longer be necessary.[end_answer] It does not make much of a difference whether it is two or three months earlier or later. What matters is the signal, the direction of travel. And that is what we have indicated: in the next few weeks we will decide when in the third quarter net bond purchases will end. We will then decide about rates and could decide to bring negative rates to an end.[end_answer] But it would be imprudent to act without having first seen the hard numbers on GDP for the second quarter and to discuss further measures without a full understanding of how the economy could develop over the following months. Discussing how many times we will act in the future, and when, is a futile exercise. Our decisions depend on data: on the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the global economy – especially China and the United States – and on how all these factors will impact on inflation, demand and production. The uncertainty and the risks we face are enormous, and no one can reasonably envisage what will happen between now and the end of the year.[end_answer] We are now in a delicate phase, and we should be concerned about any source of economic imbalance. The task of the central bank is to prevent inflation in the medium term from being inconsistent with the 2% target. There could be an economic cost to pay: we must reduce it to a minimum in order to safeguard employment and growth.[end_answer] The lesson of the sovereign debt crisis is that in a Union with a single monetary policy and a fragmented fiscal policy at national level, monetary tightening can cause highly undesirable effects if growth is unsatisfactory.[end_answer] We must prevent monetary adjustment from being accompanied by financial fragmentation. Even more so if fragmentation results from factors like the pandemic or the war that are independent of policies adopted by individual Member States. Faced with financial fragmentation that would impede the transmission of monetary policy, we should intervene decisively. The OMT reflects a different phase with different European policies. The success of our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the Next Generation EU programme clearly show that there are other possibilities that involve flexibility and cooperation, rather than confrontation, between Europe and its Member States.[end_answer] The events of the last two years call for closer coordination at European level. The energy transition, implementing the Digital Agenda, upgrading our health systems, strengthening our defence capabilities, and the other objectives set by European leaders at the Versailles summit in March imply investment needs for the production of common public goods that exceed the capacity of Member States were they to act alone. In arecent speech, I have shown that the EU as a whole will require a financial commitment of hundreds of billions of euro each year over the next decade. We can only meet these needs by strengthening fiscal capacity at European level.[end_answer] In view of the global challenges we face, Italy must continue to play an active role in Europe and act as a force for greater European cohesion, including at the fiscal level. The speech by Prime Minister Mario Draghi at the European Parliament was an important step in this regard.[end_answer] This is already foreseen – implicitly or explicitly – by the Versailles declaration, including the strengthening of the fiscal capacity at European level. We now need to make progress in that direction.[end_answer] The doomsday scenarios don't consider the response of economic policies. How things play out in the future is also up to us.[end_answer] The fact that our experience of the pandemic crisis differed from that of the global financial crisis is emblematic in this regard.[end_answer] The fiscal policies adopted after the financial crisis– based on austerity, on the compression of domestic demand – actually contributed to prolonging the economic crisis, after a shock that was initially less severe than the pandemic one. Even monetary policy adopted the necessary expansive stance only with the arrival of Draghi at the ECB.[end_answer] The reaction to COVID-19 was different. We stimulated domestic demand with wide-ranging European fiscal measures. Monetary policy intervened decisively, guaranteeing favourable financing conditions in all euro area countries and nullifying the deflationary pressures caused by the shock. And it worked: the fall in GDP was deep but short-lived and was followed by a sharp rebound.[end_answer] This is why it is not useful to discuss end-of-the-world scenarios without taking into account our ability to intervene.[end_answer] I made a simple proposal: make crypto assets subject to rules similar to those in other sectors. Why is it that if you win the new year’s lottery you pay taxes and if you sell a crypto asset you don't? And why does a listed company, that produces value and creates jobs, have to follow precise rules for public offerings, while if you sell crypto assets you don't have to explain anything to anyone? The world of crypto assets cannot remain a kind of Wild West without rules: instead, it must be regulated like other sectors in terms of taxation, transparency, public disclosure and so on.[end_answer] In some cases, more restrictive regulation or taxation would be appropriate. Think of those crypto assets that generate as much pollution as that produced by a country of ten million inhabitants in a year.[end_answer] Yes. The value of the crypto asset market exceeds that of the subprime mortgage market that triggered the financial crisis. And it is a world about which we know little. Living with that kind of unknown is not prudent.[end_answer] The growth in crypto assets reveals an unmet demand for digital assets and payment immediacy. That demand needs to be met, and if central banks and regulated intermediaries don't do it, others will. That's why the ECB is working on a central bank digital currency. This has nothing to do with crypto assets: The digital euro, as opposed to crypto assets, would be a sound, reliable means of payment in the public interest. Like cash, but in digital form.[end_answer] By 2023 we should devise a prototype. After that we will have three years to realise it. The digital euro could be issued in four or five years, if the ECB’s Governing Council and European authorities decide to do so.","['inflation is rising', 'containing inflation', 'inflation is being

462,2022-03-20,Interview with Handelsblatt,Luis de Guindos,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2022/html/ecb.in220320~128511ec7c.en.html,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Frank Wiebe and Jan Mallien on 14 March","Mr de Guindos, how big is the danger that the war in Ukraine will cause problems in the European financial system?[end_question] But haven’t there been problems in the commodities markets?[end_question] What do you see as the greatest danger for the financial system?[end_question] Are we now heading towards stagflation, a situation in which economic growth is weak and inflation is high?[end_question] The euro has been weak recently. What role does that play?[end_question] There is even some speculation that the ECB might intervene in the foreign exchange market.[end_question] Inflation has recently increased considerably. Is the ECB still actually able to keep prices under control?[end_question] The ECB last week held out the prospect of a more rapid end to its bond purchases. What does that mean for potential interest rate hikes?[end_question] Does that mean the first interest rate rise will only come later?[end_question] What exactly do you mean?[end_question] Do last week’s decisions actually amount to a tightening of monetary policy?[end_question] According to the ECB’s projections, inflation should fall back to 2% again in 2024. Why would that happen so fast?[end_question] The ECB repeatedly overestimated inflation in the past, whereas more recently it’s been underestimating inflation. Is there a problem with the models underlying the projections?[end_question] But what will the ECB do if it continues to underestimate inflation?[end_question] In Germany there’s great concern that the ECB can’t steer hard away from inflation because of the high indebtedness of countries like Italy and Spain.[end_question] Nonetheless, in the past weaknesses in the construction of the euro area have emerged again and again. Are the ECB’s instruments adequate to keep these risk premia in check if they start increasing once more?[end_question] Isn’t keeping the euro area together a task for fiscal policy?[end_question] Where should that be done, at the national or the European level?[end_question] Disclaimer","20 March 2022[end_answer] Some risks, such as the high financial market valuations and public and private indebtedness, were present even before the current crisis. But the situation today is not comparable to the one we had two years ago when the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic broke out. There are no liquidity bottlenecks. Firms can still issue bonds, for example. Stock markets are indeed fluctuating but for the moment we are not seeing any dramatic developments.[end_answer] Margin calls on commodities derivatives have been triggered, in other words, there have been demands for further collateral to cover open positions. But according to our observations, those facing these margin calls have so far been able to meet them.[end_answer] The macro risk, that is to say the possible consequences for the overall economy; higher inflation and slower growth are the greatest risks, for the banks too. That macro risk plays a far more important role than problems in individual market segments.[end_answer] I wouldn’t say so. Before the outbreak of the war we had assumed a growth rate of 4% for this year and a little bit less for next year respectively. In the most recent projections, even in our most adverse scenario for the current year, we still foresee growth of more than 2%, so no stagflation. Inflation, however, is likely to remain higher for a longer period than expected before the war.[end_answer] We do not target a particular exchange rate. We are of course aware that a weaker euro exchange rate will make certain imports more expensive. On the other hand, the currency movement is most visible against the US dollar, which is still in demand as a safe-haven currency. If we focus on the basket of currencies of our trading partners, we see that the euro has remained quite stable.[end_answer] We aren’t intervening in the foreign exchange market because we don’t target any exchange rate.[end_answer] What matters for us now is the extent to which wages respond. Because if wage increases are too high, they can push prices up even more and contribute to persistently higher inflation. We have not seen any signs of that yet, but we need to monitor developments closely. The same goes for inflation expectations. On the basis of survey information and market data, expectations for the next three to five years are anchored close to our inflation target of 2%. But we need to keep a close watch on that.[end_answer] The most important decision taken during our meeting was to delink the potential interest rate hikes from the asset purchase programme; interest rates will not need to be increased automatically after the end of net asset purchases. In this way we are keeping all our options open to respond flexibly to the data.[end_answer] It all depends on the data. We are monitoring developments in inflation very closely. We will be extremely vigilant concerning second-round effects and we will be attentive to any developments that could indicate a wage-price spiral, where both factors become mutually reinforcing. Fiscal policy should also play a role here.[end_answer] The price shock in energy and commodities that we’re currently experiencing is making many firms and workers worse off. Fiscal policy should provide temporary, targeted support to help reduce the burden. This would also reduce the danger of a wage-price spiral.[end_answer] I would say it’s a normalisation.[end_answer] At the moment making projections is particularly difficult. One reason for the drop in inflation could be that the significant increase in energy prices cannot last for too long. Prices can stabilise at a high level, but no longer increase at the current high rate.[end_answer] Over the past year we have underestimated inflation, as other institutions and economists have too. Forecasting is particularly challenging in periods of high uncertainty. Past trends play an important role in the models. Models have a tendency that projected inflation levels revert to the historical mean.[end_answer] Our decisions are based on the data. If we continue to underestimate inflation, we will respond. All options are on the table. Second round effects and a potential de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations will be the deciding factors. If we see those, then we will act.[end_answer] Our monetary policy is wholly determined by our price stability mandate. Our monetary policy decisions and the available instruments are geared to meeting our inflation target.[end_answer] A fragmentation of the euro area, with for instance major divergence in interest rates in the bond markets, could undermine the effect of monetary policy. However, the risk premia on these countries’ government bonds are about the same now as they were before the pandemic. They remain clearly below the highs seen around 2011 and 2014. In addition, nominal yields are still very low overall.[end_answer] We have the possibility to counteract that in a targeted way through reinvesting in a flexible way the purchases to replace maturing bonds under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). But we have to make a clear distinction between this flexibility and our general monetary policy objective. Our task is price stability.[end_answer] There’s no doubt that fiscal policy has an important job to do. It needs to tackle, in a targeted way, the hardships resulting from the current crisis. A targeted and temporary approach is also important to prevent the amounts of support involved from driving government debt substantially higher.[end_answer] Initially at the national level, but a coordination framework should be agreed at European level.","['higher inflation', 'higher inflation', 'anchored close to our inflation target', 'developments in inflation', 'drop in inflation',

463,2022-02-23,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2022/html/ecb.in220223~6fb3349f80.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gerald Braunberger and Christian Siedenbiedel on 21 February","Mr Lane, is monetary policy normalisation in the euro area edging closer?[end_question] Has your assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance changed with recent developments in the Ukraine crisis?[end_question] So the March meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council could be exciting. What will happen next with the bond purchases and the key policy rates?[end_question] What do you see of that right now?[end_question] Some critics think that the ECB will not dare to end its asset purchases if that would push up the cost of some countries’ sovereign debt and threaten a fragmentation of the bond markets, almost like what happened during the sovereign debt crisis…[end_question] Government spreads have indeed widened slightly in recent months. Up to what point will the ECB accept that?[end_question] So where do you see upside risks for inflation?[end_question] But aren’t you worried that almost everyone – central bankers, journalists, economists (with the possible exception of US economist Larry Summers) – has underestimated the degree and persistence of inflation?[end_question] ECB Executive Board Member Isabel Schnabel has also pointed to upside risks for inflation resulting from climate policies. Do you expect “greenflation” to exert extra pressure on prices?[end_question] Investors have been putting less capital into oil companies because they are sceptical about the future of fossil fuels. Does that contribute to the high oil prices?[end_question] If this is all to do with a pandemic cycle, do you think we will go back to the way things were before the crisis – with very low real interest rates, very low economic growth, very low inflation and low productivity growth? Or has the pandemic changed the longer-term inflation trends too?[end_question] Do you really expect trade unions not to try to compensate for the current high inflation rates? Or is it more realistic to expect a wage-price spiral at some point?[end_question] In Germany, many people still believe in the quantity theory: over the years, the ECB has printed so much money that it created inflation, and since it continues to print more money, inflation will continue to grow. Why is this theory wrong?[end_question] How is the inflation situation in the United States different to that in Europe?[end_question] The Fed has already announced its rate hike plans. How could the ECB go about it?[end_question] How do you personally experience the high inflation rates in your daily life?[end_question] Disclaimer","23 February 2022[end_answer] In times of great volatility and uncertainty we should not make absolute statements. But the data clearly suggest that we could be moving closer to our medium-term target.[end_answer] We will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the economic outlook at our March meeting. This includes the recent developments on the geopolitical front. These not only have implications for oil and gas prices, but also for investor confidence, consumer confidence, trade and so on. So in terms of inflation there is not just the mechanical effect from commodity prices, for the medium-term outlook the macroeconomic effects need to be incorporated. As we already flagged at the February meeting, the geopolitical tensions are a very important risk factor right now, for Europe in particular.[end_answer] It’s important not to anticipate the decision that the ECB’s Governing Council will take in March. A lot can happen before then and, as mentioned, there is much uncertainty in the world. But our strategy is crystal clear: we want inflation to stabilise around two per cent in the medium term. There are three possible ways of getting there. First, if the medium-term inflation outlook falls well below our target, the ECB must pursue accommodative, i.e. loose, monetary policy. Second, if medium-term inflation settles above our target, we would need to tighten monetary policy. Third, if inflation settles around our target in the medium term, then a normalisation of monetary policy, as we call it, would suffice.[end_answer] Inflation rates are high at the moment, hitting 5.1 per cent in January. We expect them to decline in the course of this year, but at what pace and by how much is uncertain. The decisive factor for monetary policy is how inflation develops in the medium term. If inflation rates are moving towards our target in the medium term, which is now looking more likely – instead of being well below two per cent as before the pandemic – we will adjust monetary policy, because we would then, for example, no longer need to make asset purchases to stabilise inflation at our target over the medium term. It was different in December, when surveys still showed the expectation that we would need to maintain asset purchases until the middle of next year, but the timeline may be shorter than what people expected then.[end_answer] Our monetary policy is driven solely by our mandate. If inflation moves close to our target, we will phase out quantitative easing. It’s true that we created a lot of flexibility during the pandemic with our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). We are also convinced that we need to ensure the transmission of monetary policy works so that our interest rate policy is not undone by fragmentation of the European bond market and the resulting strong divergence in the financing conditions across member countries. In December we said that we will be flexible in our policy when needed. And we also pointed to a particular application of the flexibility: even when the net asset purchases under the PEPP come to an end, we can reinvest the portfolio flexibly. That can help with any fragmentation risk that might arise. But the situation is in any case completely different to that in the financial crisis 13 years ago. The world today is rightly not expecting to see interest rates to return to the levels we saw 15 years ago. Should interest rates move up from a very low level to a slightly higher one, the consequences would not be comparable to what we saw then.[end_answer] We make a comprehensive assessment, especially at the quarterly meetings, such as in March. The overall economic situation is that a strong recovery of the European economy is expected. Interest rates have gone up from very low levels but remain low compared to historical averages. Of course, the financing conditions play a role for the recovery. And we will always be vigilant, we care about fragmentation risks.[end_answer] Following our February meeting we said that, compared with the December meeting, we saw more upside risks. Many of these related mainly to the short-term outlook: energy prices continued to increase and the bottlenecks in supply chains could last longer than expected. But these are not lasting phenomena, they belong to the temporary components of inflation.[end_answer] Inflation rates are indeed higher than expected, and these will persist for longer than originally thought. That mainly reflects energy prices and the supply bottlenecks, but the longer the origin of the shock remains, the more this affects a wider set of prices. So we are also revising our assessment of the persistence of inflation in this respect. But our instruments take 9, 12 or 18 months to affect the economy; that’s why we emphasise the medium-term nature of monetary policy. Many of the factors that are now driving inflation rates up will play less of a role in 12 or 18 months. The economy is not in an overheating zone. We think that most of this inflation will fade away.[end_answer] The impact on inflation will of course depend on how the green transition proceeds and this will be a gradual process. A lot also depends on what the countries do with carbon tax revenues. A recycling of tax revenues can boost the economy. At present, however, energy prices are being driven up mainly by global factors, and less by, say, national carbon taxation in Germany.[end_answer] The huge spike in oil and gas prices is not being driven by the carbon transition. The oil price has essentially been going through a sort of “pandemic cycle”. In the first year of the pandemic, 2020, energy prices fell unusually low. And in the second half of 2021, they recovered strongly. There have been all sorts of supply issues, but these will eventually be resolved. As a central bank, we don’t have to take a stance on exactly where these prices are going. But we need to be agile and responsive to what happens.[end_answer] I don’t think we‘ll go back to the 2019 situation in the coming years. But it is not entirely clear what net impact the changes will have. For example, digitalisation received a boost during the pandemic. This should be an anti-inflationary force as it reduces costs. Business travel being replaced by cheaper video calls is one example of digitalisation. On the other hand, companies that struggled with supply chain problems may become more cautious, potentially focusing on their resilience, their reliability, rather than costs. This could push up prices. In addition, the demographic developments are predictably going to continue, as the population becomes older. There is also the question of whether the internationalisation of the European workforce is coming back. A smaller workforce may translate into higher wages, but also less demand in the economy, so the net impact on inflation is unclear.[end_answer] We do expect wages to pick up. The question is how much. When we target an inflation rate of two per cent and expect productivity to grow by one per cent, wages in the euro area increasing by an average of three per cent would be consistent with our inflation target. We are monitoring the wage situation very closely. There may be an element of catch-up, but this is not the 1970s – central banks have learnt their lessons. If there was a threat of a wage-price spiral, we would act. And the wage bargaining partners know this, too.[end_answer] That is a theory of domestically generated inflation. What we have now, however, is a lot of imported inflation. That theory would also suggest that people have too much money in their bank accounts, leading to a big surge in consumption and investment, which drives prices up. We are not seeing that. It is important to recognise which prices are growing. The most remarkable increases relate to the prices of gas and electricity. Food and other products that need energy as an input are becoming more expensive. But, unlike in the United States, in Europe we are not seeing a general demand boom, just certain catch-up effects related to the pandemic. What we are seeing at the moment is mostly imported inflation, through the prices of oil and gas. The pandemic led to very high demand for liquidity and the ECB had two options: either meet that demand and allow a big expansion in liquidity in the system or have a large increase in capital market interest rates, which would have added a financial problem on top of the pandemic problem.[end_answer] Both in the United States and in Europe global factors such as the increasing price of oil have a major impact on inflation. However, in the United States domestic factors such as high demand resulting from fiscal measures play a greater role. The stimulus package introduced by President Joe Biden was much bigger than the fiscal stimulus in Europe, with a bigger impact also on the labour market. The inflation rates are correspondingly higher there. This is why we cannot compare the situation of the Federal Reserve to that of the ECB at the moment.[end_answer] We were crystal clear in our monetary policy strategy, which we published in July. We have a sequencing: our net assets purchases will first be scaled down, then ended. Then, the key policy rates will only increase above their current levels if the conditions consistent with our medium-term inflation target are met. So before we talk about potential rate decisions, we need to end net asset purchases. And we need to prepare the market for the eventual end of these purchases.[end_answer] Like everyone, we notice that the energy bill has gone up, petrol has become more expensive, the prices for many groceries have increased. But we are of course aware that people with lower incomes are much more affected by the higher prices, and that they also feel the impact of the energy shock very differently.","['inflation there is

477,2023-10-16,Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2023/html/ecb.in231016~4d53117e27.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marcel de Boer, Marijn Jongsma and Joost van Kuppeveld on 11 October 2023","Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.[end_question] What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?[end_question] Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?[end_question] Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.[end_question] QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?[end_question] Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?[end_question] So no lowering of interest rates until spring?[end_question] And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?[end_question] As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?[end_question] Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?[end_question] Disclaimer","16 October 2023[end_answer] First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.[end_answer] This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.[end_answer] What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.[end_answer] We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.[end_answer] We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate.[end_answer] This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.[end_answer] Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.[end_answer] We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.[end_answer] Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.[end_answer] I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty.[end_answer] And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.[end_answer] I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.","['inflation would have been visibly lower', 'trajectory of inflation', 'bring inflation back down', 'high inflation', 'inflation to return', 'tackling inflation', 'bring inflation back down', 'inflation is too high', 'inflation shocks', 'inflation will return', 'inflation is on its way', 'inflation was too low', 'inflation is too high', 'inflation will revert', 'inflation is conquered', 'inflation suddenly surged', 'brings inflation back down', 'inflation was too high']","['Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022', 'But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation', 'The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline', 'Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year', 'But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024', 'This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates', 'The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now', ""Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range"", 'If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more', 'We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025', 'So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%', 'Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates', 'Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range', 'We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels', 'This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%', 'We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did', 'Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner', 'It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary']",1969,M,Ireland,2019 -,"['first in demand be play a much big role in drive US inflation so the role for monetary policy be immediate ', 'now would increase rate a little early say in March have mean that inflation would have be visibly low in ?

482,2023-09-22,Interview with Yahoo Finance,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2023/html/ecb.in230922~16d0c96c09.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jennifer Schonberger","You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?[end_question] So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?[end_question] So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?[end_question] As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?[end_question] You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?[end_question] Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?[end_question] Disclaimer","22 September 2023[end_answer] Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.[end_answer] So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.[end_answer] Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.[end_answer] I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.[end_answer] Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.[end_answer] This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think  – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.","['inflation will come down', 'peak of intense inflation pressure', 'inflation rate comes down', 'bring inflation from', 'underlying inflation challenge', 'bringing inflation all the way back', 'inflation is firmly on its way back', 'inflation is firmly on its way back', 'inflation assessment going off track', 'deterioration in the inflation dynamic', 'inflation to come back', 'target for inflation', 'grow more quickly than inflation', 'kill inflationbring inflation back to target', 'raise the inflation forecast', 'amplify into core inflation']","['Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year.', 'So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure.', 'And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes.', 'So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025.', 'That´s the scale of the underlying inflation challenge.', 'And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.', 'And so we´re emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we´re also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent.', 'But of course, we meet every few weeks.

483,2023-09-05,Interview with The Currency,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2023/html/ecb.in230905~e1653c4e1b.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stephen Kinsella on 31 August 2023","Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?[end_question] In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?[end_question] Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.[end_question] I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?[end_question] I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?[end_question] I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?[end_question] Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?[end_question] I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?[end_question] Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?[end_question] Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?[end_question] We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic![end_question] Disclaimer","5 September 2023[end_answer] We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.[end_answer] Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.[end_answer] Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.[end_answer] I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing.[end_answer] This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.[end_answer] I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.[end_answer] Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.[end_answer] Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.[end_answer] Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.[end_answer] Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.[end_answer] I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.[end_answer] The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.[end_answer] Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.[end_answer] We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.[end_answer] For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?","['inflation came down', 'inflation come down', 'inflation is standing', 'strong services inflation', 'services inflation remains significant', 'downward drift in energy inflation', 'inflation would fall away', 'shape of the inflation dynamic', 'inflation doesn´t collapse', 'inflation arose', 'inflation, again, does not collapse', 'inflation episode is time-limited', 'inflation would remain high', 'temporary inflation episode', 'high inflation', 'fight inflation', 'contain inflation', 'inflation increase', 'inflation rose', 'the inflation problem', 'high inflation', 'inflation is going to be high', 'infltion gets embedded', 'produce more inflationunexpected inflation shock', 'high inflation', 'inflation impact', 'impact on inflation', 'impact on inflation', 'cyclical inflation problem', 'long-term inflation problem', 'inflation would basically become de-anchored', 'inflation will come back', 'inflation to come back']","['So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome.', 'So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn.', 'But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.', 'So we will have to see.

What progress do you think Europe will make in the next 25 years?[end_question] Disclaimer","24 May 2023[end_answer] We are studying the design of the digital euro, its distribution and its impact on the financial sector. There are around 50 people in the team working on this project. We are in regular contact with the European Commission which is due to present a legislative proposal in June. This will provide the regulatory framework for the digital euro. Then in October the Governing Council will decide whether to launch a preparation phase to develop and test the digital euro. This phase could last two or three years. If the Governing Council and the European legislators – Member States and Members of the European Parliament – agree, we could launch the digital euro in three or four years.[end_answer] To safeguard financial stability, we need to keep central bank money at the heart of the financial system. And we want to offer citizens a risk-free European digital means of payment that they can use free of charge anywhere in the euro area, in shops, online or for payments between individuals. Such a solution doesn’t exist at the moment. The digital euro will also provide a platform for European financial intermediaries to offer innovative payment services across the entire euro area. At present, services developed in one European country are often not available in others. And the European card payments market is dominated by two non-European companies whose cards are not accepted everywhere. Can you imagine a similar situation in the United States? And this situation would be exacerbated by the growth of big techs, which don’t hesitate to use their customers’ personal data to make money.[end_answer] The European Central Bank will not have access to personal data.[end_answer] As for the financial intermediaries that will distribute the digital euro, a balance will need to be found between ensuring data confidentiality and combating money laundering and terrorist financing.[end_answer] This balance will be determined by the legislator. In current discussions, some want to prioritise confidentiality, while others want to prioritise the fight against illegal activities.[end_answer] The simplicity of a payment instrument that is easy to use, available across the entire euro area and which will strengthen the use of our currency. Increased competition in the payments market and innovation based on this financial “raw material” that we will make available to European financial intermediaries. And greater monetary sovereignty.[end_answer] The ECB will ensure that all users benefit from a basic service that enables payments between individuals, retailers and public authorities. Europeans will, for example, be able to use it to pay online or in shops, to send money to their loved ones or to pay their taxes. And banks will be able to offer additional features such as recurring payments, payments based on usage or access to other financial services.[end_answer] We have been very clear: the ECB would issue the digital euro but would not distribute it. Citizens will not have an account at the ECB or at the national central banks. We do not have any expertise in dealing with customers, and it would not make sense for us to enter into this business. And we are not looking to gain a large market share. We want to build a presence everywhere, but be dominant nowhere. Europeans will know that they always have the option to use the digital euro, but they will only use it for a fraction of their payments. We are not seeking to expand the role of public money, but rather to preserve it, as in its current form – cash – its use is declining. Making the digital euro available as a complement to cash is a natural development in an increasingly digital economy.[end_answer] Because we don’t want to create tensions for financial intermediaries that could negatively affect the financing of the economy and the transmission of monetary policy. The digital euro would be a means of payment, not a form of investment or savings. We have at times mentioned a ceiling of €3,000. This amount is close to the average gross salary in the euro area and would not cause problems for financial stability. Larger payments will be possible thanks to a link between digital euro accounts and traditional bank accounts.[end_answer] Absolutely not. We are working on issuing a new series of high-tech banknotes with a view to preventing counterfeiting and reducing the environmental impact. We will make banknotes available to citizens for as long as there is demand for them. But it’s possible to imagine that one day the digitalisation of the economy could lead to cash becoming marginalised. We cannot run the risk that central bank money is no longer used. That’s why we need a digital euro.[end_answer] We want people to relate to the new series of banknotes we are working on. We are considering a number of themes, including European culture, and we will soon consult the wider public.Personally, I would like to see famous Europeans represented on our future banknotes.[end_answer] We are already working closely with the central banks of the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Sweden. We are in a preliminary stage where we compare notes on our progress. But interoperability will require more work. For example, while interoperability is desirable, different national rules on confidentiality would make it more challenging.[end_answer] If we, as Europeans, want to continue to play a role on the world stage, we need to act together. We need to make further progress towards closer integration, introduce more efficient decision-making processes, and develop a permanent fiscal capacity at the European level. We need to be able to provide a common response to crises, as we did during the pandemic. A European fiscal policy that complements monetary policy would enable us to avoid many tensions and imbalances.",[],[],1959,M,Italy,2019 -,[],[],0,0,5892,[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],0,[],0,0,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
491,2023-05-14,Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore,Luis de Guindos,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2023/html/ecb.in230514~b00faef29f.en.html,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Isabella Bufacchi","With seven hikes in one year, the ECB has raised interest rates at a very rapid pace, by a total of 375 basis points, to bring inflation back to its 2% medium-term target. This unprecedented monetary policy tightening has come after many years of low rates, and at the same time as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought war to Europe, as well as the energy crisis and the risk of recession. Beyond just price stability, does the ECB take into consideration the impact of this monetary policy tightening on banks and financial stability?[end_question] And do you consider the effects on households and businesses, and on the economy?[end_question] There were fears that the ECB’s highly restrictive monetary policy would only be able to tackle inflation at the cost of a recession in the euro area, but that does not appear to be the case…[end_question] The Governing Council’s latest decision was to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, a smaller increase than the previous 50 and 75 basis-point rate hikes. However, the language used in the monetary policy decisions and by President Christine Lagarde at the press conference was more hawkish than dovish: “We have more ground to cover”, “we are not pausing”…[end_question] Were you in favour of a 25 basis-point hike, or would you have preferred 50?[end_question] And what’s next?[end_question] Which of the two matters more: headline or core inflation?[end_question] At its last meeting, the Governing Council also decided to discontinue reinvestments of maturing securities in the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio as of July 2023. Meanwhile the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) remains untouched, with no sales of securities before maturity: how meaningful is quantitative tightening (QT) as a restrictive monetary policy tool when applied to reinvestments under the APP only?[end_question] Another important tool is also under the spotlight, namely loans under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). In coming months, the banks will repay €477 billion: can you confirm whether a kind of “bridge loan” formula is envisaged to mitigate the impact of this bumper repayment?[end_question] Banks have had worse things to worry about than TLTROs: first the pandemic, followed by the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and inflation. They have overcome many crises up to now.[end_question] And what about Italy’s banks?[end_question] Are there lessons to be learned from the banking crisis in the United States?[end_question] Disclaimer","14 May 2023[end_answer] Our mandate is price stability and tightened monetary policy is a response to the very high inflation we face. This has fallen from the 10.8% we saw in October last year, but it remains high. Still, despite the very strong tightening cycle, we have not seen any financial stability problems. Yields on government bonds have increased, but spreads have remained fairly stable. This rise in interest rates has not resulted in greater fragmentation. Moreover, European banks’ balance sheets are improving, with higher-than-expected profits in the first quarter of this year. There is some tension in the European non-bank financial intermediary sector, which is highly leveraged and more exposed to liquidity risk, but nothing comparable to the banking crisis in the United States.[end_answer] We do. Higher interest rates have started to affect businesses, but there has been neither a wave of defaults, nor of fallen angels (bonds once rated as investment grade now downgraded to speculative grade). Regarding households, a strong labour market continues to offer support for coping with tighter financing conditions. So far so good, I would say. But, of course, we continue to monitor the situation and we take a wide range of indicators into account.[end_answer] Indeed, our forecasts in December pointed to a technical recession, but we revised them in March. Growth was flat in the fourth quarter of 2022, and slightly better in the first quarter of 2023. The euro area managed to avoid a technical recession. Nevertheless, contractionary monetary policy serves to tighten financing conditions and we have started to see this being felt on the market for bank loans. Banks have started to tighten lending conditions, which shows that monetary policy transmission is working. And we will see what impact this will have on the real economy.[end_answer] A quarter of a percentage point is “the normal” monetary policy rate hike. Hikes of 50 and 75 basis point were extraordinary steps in response to extremely high inflation. We have had to raise rates by 375 basis points: it was an important stage in our journey and inflation is in fact coming down. But we have now entered the home stretch of our monetary policy tightening path. And that’s why we are returning to normality, to 25 basis-point steps.[end_answer] Raising rates by 25 basis points was the right decision. I was in favour, even during our preliminary discussions on the Executive Board. And then, the overwhelming majority of the Governing Council supported the proposal. You could even say that there was virtually unanimous support for a quarter of a point.[end_answer] Looking ahead, it will depend on the data. We will decide on a meeting-by-meeting basis. And based on the evidence of how the tightening of financing conditions has worked. And on the path of inflation, headline and core.[end_answer] Both will ease in the coming months. Energy prices will be key in determining headline inflation. We will need to consider the base effect as well as the impact of government support measures coming to an end. But core inflation will also be telling. It is a useful indicator for predicting inflation over the medium term. In this regard, I am concerned about service prices, which account for a large share of core inflation. Demand for services in Europe, for example in Italy and Spain, is very strong and highly sensitive to wage and labour market developments. We need to closely observe the impact of wages and services on core inflation.[end_answer] Interest rates are our primary monetary policy tool. Reducing and then stopping reinvestments under the APP, the so-termed QT, is fully aligned with our monetary policy stance. It works in parallel with raising interest rates and reinforces the tightening. We think it has led to an increase of 60-70 basis points in ten-year government bond yields. But the main tightening comes from the rate increase of 375 basis points, as that is our primary monetary policy tool. We will publish more data on the impact of our tightening in the coming days, but, still, calculations should always be taken with caution. Overall, effective communication of QT and the Transmission Protection Instrument have helped to avoid market turmoil with the end of reinvestments under the APP.[end_answer] The TLTROs have served as an extraordinary tool in extraordinary situations, for example the pandemic, which is now over. Banks have planned to make repayments based on the roadmap. I expect that, for the June tranche, banks – even those that have made most use of the TLTROs – will not have any trouble rebuilding this liquidity. Apart from the alternatives of the main refinancing operations and longer-term refinancing operations, in extraordinary cases, we may revert to using TLTROs themselves as a valid alternative. They remain part of our toolbox.[end_answer] Euro area banks are resilient in terms of capital and liquidity. And now, thanks to the higher margins from the rise in interest rates, profits are increasing as well. But we mustn’t drop our guard. We need to be very cautious: the combination of a slowing economy and the interest rate hikes will bring a rise in the cost of funding for banks and possibly an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs). At the moment, the improvement in margins more than compensates for the potential losses from the growth in NPLs. But we need to keep a close eye on developments.[end_answer] Italian banks are in a very different situation to that of 10-12 years ago. Their resilience is not in doubt: they have more capital, are more liquid and have cleaned up their balance sheets, with NPLs falling to an unprecedented level of slightly below 2.5% of total assets. But just as for all European banks, everything will depend on how the economy performs. The resilience of businesses and households will be key. We do not expect a wave of NPLs, but now is not the time for complacency.[end_answer] The crisis that hit US regional banks served as a wake-up call: we saw how market sentiment can change abruptly. The situation in Europe is different. It is not so exposed to the systemic risks faced by the US regional banks and has, for example, a much larger retail deposit base. But the fact remains that digitalisation and social media can play a role in quickly driving bank runs. That’s why I am convinced that the EDIS (European deposit insurance scheme) is a crucial step. It is imperative that we complete banking union by equipping ourselves with the EDIS. Having an incomplete banking union could end up being one of the biggest chinks in our armour. I would even say that lacking the EDIS is the main vulnerability for the European banking system. Not introducing it would be a serious mistake.","['high inflation', 'high inflation', 'inflation is in fact coming down', 'path of inflation', 'core inflation', 'core inflation', 'core

499,2023-03-26,Interview with Business Post,Luis de Guindos,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2023/html/ecb.in230326~d58344edad.en.html,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Daniel Murray","Have you come to expect crisis and are you comfortable managing crisis ?[end_question] Are you more optimistic about Europe’s economic outlook than you were in the latter half of last year?[end_question] So you are more optimistic about the inflationary environment, but things have changed with regards to financial stability?[end_question] The ECB’s goal is to get inflation to 2 per cent. Do you have a time period within which you want to see that realistically happen?[end_question] If headline inflation is projected to fall, do you have more confidence in the energy market and energy prices in Europe even by next winter?[end_question] So what tools should be used to address core inflation?[end_question] Is there a ceiling in how high the ECB can raise interest rates, and have you stress tested what would happen to bank balance sheets in the event of a 4-6 per cent rate?[end_question] Governments have intervened with large subsidy programmes to alleviate the effects of inflation. Is there a risk these are keeping inflation higher for longer, and what approach should be taken to winding them down?[end_question] Is the significant level of public debt an emerging risk for financial stability, especially considering that governments are expected to need larger spending programmes to deal with the likes of the climate crisis?[end_question] Will that impact on the ability of governments to spend on addressing the climate crisis?[end_question] How concerned are you by what happened at Credit Suisse in the last two weeks and the banking issues in the United States as well?[end_question] Was the Swiss approach to imposing losses on bondholders first a risky one and could there be consequences for euro area banks?[end_question] What does the ECB stand ready to do if there is contagion across European banks?[end_question] Does the Credit Suisse situation look like an isolated case, or has it highlighted new systemic weaknesses? Is it different to the last financial crash?[end_question] Are you happy with the availability of data on the non-bank sector to assess those vulnerabilities?[end_question] Having steered Spain through its financial crash and recovery, how have you viewed Ireland’s recovery and the abnormal growth of our economy due to the multinational presence here?[end_question] The significant presence of multinationals in Ireland distorts our own economy and even the wider EU economy. Is that an issue for the ECB in properly assessing economic trends or risks?[end_question] Ireland has seen an exit of domestic banks in recent years, and we are now down to two main pillar banks. Is this a concern in terms of financial stability?[end_question] Should banks increase remuneration of depositors?[end_question] So are we now moving into an extended period of high interest rates?[end_question] Disclaimer","26 March 2023[end_answer] The situation is quite different to the one we had in 2008/09. First, banks have much better capital and liquidity positions, well above minimum requirements, their situation is overall more solid, also on account of more demanding regulation. Secondly, looking at the macroeconomic situation, there are no problems with respect to the competitiveness of European economies. For example, the balance of payments in Spain, Greece, Ireland, or Portugal are in a much better position. And finally, the economic policy approach is different in comparison with 2010, 2011 and 2012. We have had four years of looser fiscal rules. That was the correct response to the crisis during the pandemic. It was a sort of whatever it takes in fiscal policy while monetary policy was very supportive too. We have other difficulties now, but these can be addressed more easily than during the great financial crisis.[end_answer] Our projections in December had included a technical recession, with two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But that’s no longer our baseline. Similarly, new indicators and data on headline inflation had been quite positive since October. The projections released last week were more optimistic on growth and inflation. Nevertheless, growth numbers weren’t great, hovering around 1 per cent, while inflation was clearly more positive, especially headline inflation.[end_answer] The question now is how the events in the US banking system and Credit Suisse will impact the euro area economy. Over the next weeks and months, we need to assess whether they will give rise to an additional tightening of financing conditions.[end_answer] These kinds of events increase uncertainty, and we must take that into consideration. Our impression is that they will lead to an additional tightening of credit standards in the euro area. And perhaps this will feed through to the economy in terms of lower growth and lower inflation. But we have to assess the intensity of this factor. It is still too early to say now.[end_answer] We want a timely return to 2 per cent inflation. We know it cannot be tomorrow, but it has to be within our projection horizon, which is a period of two years. But the trajectory of inflation is much more important than just touching the 2 per cent target. Headline inflation will decline quite rapidly over the next six to seven months as the base effects play in favour of a rapid reduction in inflation. What we want to see is a steady and clear convergence towards the 2 per cent target. In that respect, core inflation is going to be key. It is very difficult to converge towards the 2 per cent target in a sustainable way without a clear decline in core inflation.[end_answer] Falling energy prices will play a very important role, supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away, and our monetary policy decisions, with a certain lag, have started to have an impact. Our bank lending survey already shows a tightening of financing conditions. So those are the three elements that will help reduce headline inflation.[end_answer] However, there are other aspects that will be less positive. The first is the evolution of wages: wage increases are accelerating. We look at this carefully because it has an impact mainly on services prices. The second aspect is fiscal policy and how fiscal support measures evolve over time. These measures may be positive and reduce inflation in the short-term, but once they start being withdrawn in 2024, the opposite effect can be expected. And finally, China’s reopening. This is positive for growth, but, as we have seen recently, it can add to price pressures, mainly for raw materials and commodities.[end_answer] All in all, I am positive about the decline of headline inflation, but we need to look very carefully at the evolution of core inflation. There will be a disinflationary process over the coming months. But to reach our target core inflation must also start to decelerate too.[end_answer] Monetary policy has a role to play, as does fiscal policy, which has to be temporary, targeted and selective. Simultaneously, wage moderation is needed, and in that respect fiscal policy can help.[end_answer] We raised rates by 50 basis points in March and we are open-minded with respect to the future. We are data dependent. There is now this additional element of uncertainty stemming from the financial sector problems in the United States and in Switzerland.And we will take a meeting-by-meeting approach. We are not pre-committing to any action.[end_answer] Regarding stress testing, the 2023 exercise led by the European Banking Authority was already in the pipeline, and the results will be published in July. But overall the situation in the euro area banking system is much better than it was a decade ago in terms of liquidity, capital, and supervision. Therefore, we believe the sector as a whole is resilient, sound, and safe. But we shouldn’t be complacent.[end_answer] Fiscal support measures must be temporary, selective, and targeted to vulnerable groups in the society. The ECB and European Commission’s approach is that across-the-board subsidies for everyone are not very helpful. They would ultimately be an impediment to the green transition, for example, because prices must reflect the reality of the marketplace. Across-the-board subsidies create opacity about the right incentives and price signals to reduce demand.[end_answer] Energy prices are declining everywhere. Thus, subsidies should adjust to this decline. Government should not use the pretext that was set when energy prices were very high to maintain these subsidies in the future. That wouldn’t make any economic sense.[end_answer] Public debt ratios in Europe have risen quite a lot since the pandemic. That was the correct fiscal policy response to the pandemic, but now we have higher public debt ratios and higher structural public deficits. So, we have to look at this very carefully. The European Commission’s approach to deactivate the ”escape clause” [from fiscal rules] in 2024 is the right one. The EU’s fiscal rules are under discussion, but the EU Commission has just given guidance to governments for 2024 budgetary policy. That was especiallyneeded because the interest rate situation and the cost of funding for governments is not the same as was three years ago.[end_answer] There are new priorities in the European Union, such as defence expenditures that will rise due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and we need to spend on the digital and green transitions. These will require a lot of public investment. But we also have the NextGeneration EU funds which will be a very important helping hand for many countries.[end_answer] The situation in the United States created a lot of uncertainty in terms of confidence in the financial system and that had an impact on Credit Suisse. But the situations are very different. In the case of the US, Silicon Valley Bank had quite a unique business model. The lending and deposit-base was very much concentrated on tech companies and due to the duration mismatch between its assets and liabilities, it was extremely exposed to interest rate risk.[end_answer] The solution for Credit Suisse was rapid and that’s good. In the euro area, we clarified that the seniority order followed in this case in terms of loss absorption would not be possible. We will respect the order established by the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive. Common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses, and only after their full use would Additional Tier 1 instruments be required to be written down.[end_answer] We have not seen a lot of contagion. It is clear that our pecking order is equity first and only then junior debt. We clarified this and that has reduced any potential uncertainty that the decision by the Swiss authorities could have created.[end_answer] Financial stability is essential and we’re closely monitoring it. Liquidity instruments in our toolbox are ready to be used again. The toolkit is available should it become necessary.[end_answer] In the case of Credit Suisse and the US banks, there were specific and idiosyncratic factors.Our main concern in terms of financial stability is the situation of the non-banks. This has been the case for some years, and it is the soft spot in the financial system. At system level, the banking sector in Europe is sound and resilient. But the non-banks have been growing as share of the financial system in Europe, and they took a lot of risks during the times of very low-interest rates. These are risks in terms of liquidity, duration, credit, and leverage. Thus, when monetary policy changes, these potential vulnerabilities can come to the surface.[end_answer] We are not the supervisors of non-banks. But non-banks are interconnected with the traditional banks we supervise, and that’s why we also look into this sector. We cooperate in international fora such as the Financial Stability Board, the IMF, the G20, ESRB and ESMA aiming to improve the macroprudential toolkit for non-banks. We do believe it could be a source of problems for the whole financial system, and we need to be careful.[end_answer] The problems of Ireland in 2010 were quite similar to the Spanish ones. The problems were created because of a real estate bubble, and the bursting of that bubble gave rise to serious problems which meant the governments had to help banks. At the end of the day, both programmes were quite successful. Ireland cleaned up the banks and improved governance, and the Irish economy has been outperforming European peers since 2013. The case of Spain is quite similar. The lesson is that once you clean up the banking industry, economies improved too.[end_answer] In Ireland the presence of multinationals is a particular characteristic. In Spain, the tourist sector is very large and important for the economy. With a bit of perspective, the consequences of the programmes for both countries were positive and the kind of problems they had a decade ago are not there now.[end_answer] I don’t think it is a problem. We know the very idiosyncratic characteristics of Ireland in terms of the difference between GDP and GNP. We understand why and it is taken into consideration.[end_answer] That is more an issue for competition authorities, but I can tell you about my Spanish experience which could perhaps be applied to Ireland. Competition is not necessarily determined by the number of players in a market. Because if you have for instance numerous players which are not very active or are weak, then that competition isn’t real.[end_answer] Remuneration of deposits should go in parallel with rate rises on the assets side of the banks. Rates should go up not only for credits but also for deposits. This is something we are looking at very carefully.[end_answer] My personal view is that the period of negative interest rates is over, at least in the medium term. We are going through a period of very high uncertainty.","['optimistic on growth and inflation', 'lower inflation', 'trajectory of inflation', 'inflation will decline', 'rapid reduction in inflation', 'inflation is going to be key', 'decline in core inflation', 'reduce headline inflation', 'reduce inflation', 'decline in headline inflation', 'evolution of core inflation', 'target core inflation']","['The projections released last week were more optimistic on growth and inflation.', 'Our impression is that they will lead to an additional tightening of credit standards in the euro area.

509,2023-01-17,Interview with Financial Times,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2023/html/ecb.in230117~1ab0df6f3d.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Wolf on 12 January 2023","From your perspective, how much do you see the big rise in inflation as having been due to a supply shock or a demand shock, globally and also within the eurozone?[end_question] Isn’t it also true that the impact on prices of strong demand elsewhere — in the US, for example — will look like a supply shock to you?[end_question] There are two views on what has happened.[end_question] One is we’ve had a series of unexpected shocks to the world economy: the pandemic; then the swift opening, which brought unbalanced demand; and then the energy shock. So, the world went crazy and we’ve simply done our best to manage it.[end_question] The other view is that monetary policy fuelled the flames, with a long history of ultra-loose monetary policy, followed by a gigantic monetary expansion in the early period of the pandemic. And this was then made worse by huge fiscal expansions, notably in the US. So, the central banks and fiscal authorities bear the blame for this.[end_question] How would you respond to these different views?[end_question] Again, there are two sides.[end_question] One says that most of this inflation is going to fade away, partly because the base effect of the high prices of a year before is going to lower annual inflation a great deal. Also, inflation expectations look well anchored and the labour market well behaved, at least in Europe. So, the real danger is that you are going to persist with tightening or “normalisation” for too long. Given the long and variable lags in monetary policy, you’re going to create an unnecessarily deep and costly recession.[end_question] So, that’s one side. But the other side, someone might say, is that many households are suffering a big negative shock to real incomes, which they are only [now] beginning to realise. So, there is a lot more labour market pressure to come and you are going to have to tighten a great deal and then stay there for a long time.[end_question] In other words, there are the risks of doing too much and too little, in a situation of extreme uncertainty. Which risk do you currently think is the bigger and on which side do you think the ECB should err?[end_question] Are you reasonably comfortable, in retrospect, with the decisions you’ve made over the last couple of years? Do you feel that not only are you in a reasonable place, but that you’ve made sensible judgments?[end_question] How would you articulate the condition of the eurozone economy in comparison with the situation in the US?[end_question] One of the consequences of this divergence has been a fairly big rise in the dollar. Does this shift in the external value of the currency cause issues for your policymaking?[end_question] There’s a debate over whether the inflation, the rise in interest rates, the tightening of monetary policy and the move away from ultra-loose monetary policy represents a temporary blip, a big blip, but still a blip. Alternatively, is this the point at which we are moving into a more “normal environment” with nominal interest rates well away from zero and real interest rates positive rather than negative?[end_question] Do you have views on this?[end_question] So this inflation shock has got rid of this environment of self-reinforcing low inflation and this is, to some degree, a relatively benign outcome.[end_question] So, we might have inflation at target, monetary policy credible at delivering the inflation target, and a continuation of low real interest rates. In an economy with a lot of debt, this sounds like an ideal combination.[end_question] Where do you think interest rates might end up before this is over?[end_question] Let me move on to “market fragmentation”, or divergences in monetary conditions across member states. How significant a risk do you think this is? And do you have the tools needed to manage it?[end_question] There are people who note that we are experiencing a considerable change in the monetary environment for the financial sector. So, there is discussion about potential risks of financial instability. How do you perceive that in the ECB?[end_question] One other question about credibility. Let’s assume you’re correct that inflation will go back to target. Nonetheless, there will have been quite a jump in the price level. So, people will have suffered permanent losses on nominal assets. They might then say “well, this has shown us that big jumps in the price level can happen”.[end_question] People may say to themselves “well, maybe they’re going to do this to us again and so maybe we should be cautious about owning these sorts of assets”. And a big part of monetary stability is designed to make people feel confident that these assets are reliable in terms of their real value.[end_question] Can you comment briefly on fiscal policy and its relationship to monetary policy — an issue Mario Draghi talked about quite a bit — as well as the fiscal policy framework, which is being discussed again by Eurozone governments.[end_question] Just on your first point, there are member countries, some of them important, which do have high debt levels both by historical standards and by most norms. You are implying that these should be lowered. Given relatively modest low structural growth rates, that’s quite a challenge, isn’t it?[end_question] What do you think of the arguments that have been put forward, by[end_question] What is your view of the usefulness of a digital euro?[end_question] But you do think this can be done without destabilising banks? And particularly bank deposits?[end_question] Disclaimer","17 January 2023[end_answer] The way to think about the last two years is that this supply versus demand question has to be addressed at a sectoral level.[end_answer] We clearly have a supply shock in energy; and the pandemic had previously led to a supply shock in contact-intensive services. But there have also been two sectoral demand shocks: one was for goods, because there was a big switch towards consumption of goods; and then the post-Covid reopening took the form of a demand shock for services, notably in Europe.[end_answer] You have to take account of this sectoral differentiation. In Europe, we do not have a big rise in overall demand. But we have had this global mismatch in goods, which led to bottlenecks, and then, over the past year, a reopening effect on demand for services.[end_answer] So, this is why we at the ECB say there are both demand and supply channels at work. But it’s best not to view these at the aggregate level.[end_answer] There’s a large global component to inflation.[end_answer] Let me slightly broaden the point. On one level, the big increase in global prices of commodities and goods clearly reflect global demand and supply. But, since Europe is a big producer of manufactured goods, that has also boosted export prices for European firms.[end_answer] So, it’s not just that the prices of imported goods have increased. Europe has also been a beneficiary of high demand for its exports. We see that in cars and in luxury goods. And so, even though Europe has suffered a lot from high import prices for energy over the past year, there’s been a partial offset via higher export prices.[end_answer] I’m going to be firmly in the first camp of essentially saying that we have had these very large shocks.[end_answer] For me the way to differentiate these narratives is that before the pandemic we had five years of low interest rates but little inflationary pressure. So, the idea that the world we lived in was creating an inflationary environment just doesn’t ring true.[end_answer] We did have very large quantitative easing and very low interest rates, and this did limit the disinflationary pressure, keeping inflation in the eurozone at around 1-1.5 per cent rather than allowing outright deflation. But we were not creating inflationary pressure. So, I don’t see that today’s inflation came out of excessively loose monetary policy.[end_answer] What is true, however, is that once these shocks had occurred it became important to move away from the super-loose monetary policy. If we had kept rates super low for too long, these might have translated into self-sustaining inflation. That’s why we have moved away from low interest rates and quantitative easing over the last number of months, when this inflation shock turned out to be fairly large and quite durable.[end_answer] These risks need to be taken seriously. But these have different prominence at different phases of the monetary policy cycle.[end_answer] The first phase for us was indeed to normalise monetary policy, to bring interest rates away from the lower bound towards something corresponding to neutral rates. We have done this. So, now we have the policy rate at around 2 per cent, which is in the “ballpark” of neutral.[end_answer] Yet we are still not where the risks become more two-sided or symmetric. So, we need to raise rates more. Once we’ve made further progress, the risks will be more two-sided, where will have to balance the risks of doing too much versus doing too little. This is not just an issue about the next meeting or the next couple of meetings, it’s going to be an issue for the next year or two.[end_answer] It’s important to remember that we meet every six weeks. We will have to make sure we take a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, to make sure we adjust to the evolution of the two risks.[end_answer] What does that mean? We have to keep an open mind on the appropriate level of interest rates. The big error would be maintaining a misdiagnosis for too long. The risk is not what happens in one meeting or in two meetings. What happened in the 1970s was a misdiagnosis over a long period of time. The issue here is flexibility in both directions to make sure that policy is adjusted in a timely manner, rather than maintaining a fixed view of the world for too long.[end_answer] Fundamentally, yes.[end_answer] Let me, first, give you a reminder of the last 15 months or so. Inflation pressures were starting to build from the summer of 2021. So maybe the first meeting at which this was sufficiently visible in the data would have been December 2021. But December 2021 was also when the Omicron variant was emerging.[end_answer] We did make an adjustment in December 2021 by firming up the ending of the PEPP (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme)from March 2022. Then, at the February 2022 meeting, we signalled a faster pace of reduction in asset purchases. We got out of a very large programme of quantitative easing by June 2022. And then we started hiking in July.[end_answer] So, what we did between December 2021 and June 2022 was focus on reducing QE, before starting to raise rates, in the knowledge that we could move relatively quickly once we started raising rates. The debate about the exact timing is misplaced, because we knew that we could always catch up if it turned out that rates needed to be moved more quickly. In the end, where we are now is reasonable.[end_answer] Any debate about whether we moved too slowly on rates has to be assessed in the context of being willing to move at a fast pace once we started hiking. This debate should not be about when exactly a central bank starts raising rates. After all, the yield curve jumps in anticipation of what we are expected to do and we’ve also proven an ability to move quickly.[end_answer] If you asked your readers a year ago what probability they would put on the ECB being at a 2 per cent policy rate by the end of 2022, I don’t think many would have bet on that. So, we’ve proven we are responsive and we’ve also proven our determination to deliver our inflation target. 2022 was a year of a big pivot, a big transition from accommodative towards restrictive policy.[end_answer] By the way, we do have a symmetric target. It was always important to demonstrate the symmetry. In the same way that we were active in fighting below-target inflation, we also have to be active in fighting above-target inflation.[end_answer] US inflation is clearly more of a textbook case, in that a lot of inflation is coming from the demand side. The labour market has been hot, with a lot of vacancies, limited labour supply and so on. And it’s clear that monetary policy is working to cool down the labour market in a classic way.[end_answer] We have a more complicated situation in the euro area, because a lot of the inflation is connected to a negative terms of trade shock. We have declining real incomes and falling real wages, and a big supply component to the inflation.[end_answer] Regardless of where the inflation comes from, one has a risk of “second-round” effects, in which high inflation gives rise to upward pressure on wages and profit mark-ups. Monetary policy has to ensure that the second-round effect doesn’t become excessive or persistent.[end_answer] The fact that we have a negative real income shock in Europe, which the US does not have because it’s an energy exporter as well as an importer, means that the scale of monetary policy tightening needed to adjust inflation to target is smaller in the euro area than in the US. We both have a 2 per cent inflation target. But delivering 2 per cent means that interest rates will differ substantially between us and the US.[end_answer] It’s on the list of factors we look at but it’s definitely not at the top of the list. The euro area is a continental-sized economy. But there is a spillover from global monetary policy, because the rate of growth in the global economy and the rate of price increases of global commodities and other tradable goods are globally determined.[end_answer] We also have to take into account the downward pressure on inflation from tightening by other central banks around the world, which generates weaker demand for our exports and lower import prices. But this is not particularly via the euro-dollar rate, but rather via the global dynamics for commodities and tradable goods.[end_answer] Let me strongly differentiate the nominal versus the real sides of this story.[end_answer] For me, there are three regimes: one, inflation chronically below target; two, inflation more or less on target; and, three, inflation above target.[end_answer] Before the pandemic we, in the eurozone, had inflation at around 1 per cent for many years. So markets believed that interest rates would be super-low indefinitely. And that can be self-sustaining, because expectations would rationally be that inflation remains below targeted in that scenario.[end_answer] But I don’t think we’re going back to that. The inflation shock has proven that inflation is not deterministically bound to be too low. The narrative I often heard before the pandemic on the “Japanification” of the European economy has gone quiet.[end_answer] I think this will be a lasting result. So, if expectations have now re-anchored at our 2 per cent target, compared to being well below it, interest rates will go to the level consistent with that target, not back to the super-low rates we needed to fight below-target inflation. For nominal rates, that makes a big difference.[end_answer] On the second question you posed, which was on the equilibrium real interest rate, I would be in the agnostic camp. It’s not clear whether there will be a large movement in the equilibrium real rate.[end_answer] Let me point to a couple of indirect mechanisms here. One is that in the pre-pandemic period some of the anti-inflationary forces were coming from globalisation. There were also the anti-inflationary effects of the deleveraging and fiscal austerity after the global financial crisis and European sovereign debt crisis.[end_answer] It’s a fair assumption that globalisation is going to be different. At the very least, there will be more concern about the resilience of supply chains and so forth and also more concern for security. This means that inflation is going to be more sensitive to domestic slack and less to global conditions. How big an effect that will have is uncertain. But it is a structural change in the world economy.[end_answer] The other point is that we had deleveraging after the global financial crisis and the European sovereign-debt crisis. In a number of countries, households had to reduce their household debt. Also, we had a number of years when governments felt they had to run austere fiscal policies, or were forced to do so. This, too, was bad for aggregate demand.[end_answer] In the pandemic, however, governments had to run big deficits. That spending was transferred to households and firms. Also, the pandemic created “forced savings”, because there was less opportunity to spend. So, household balance sheets look better now than before the pandemic.[end_answer] So one factor that will be different now is the globalisation process. A second factor is where we are in terms of the balance sheets of the private sector and the governments. Governments will have to pull back from the high level of fiscal support they offered during the pandemic. But by and large it should be a normalisation of fiscal policy rather than a sudden stop in fiscal support. The fact that households have better balance sheets now also means that support for aggregate demand will probably be stronger after the pandemic than before the pandemic.[end_answer] You can classify it as a by-product of this shock. It has reminded the world that inflationary shocks can happen. And we absolutely see that in our surveys. If we go back to a year and a half ago, most of the distributions of inflation expectations were below 2 per cent. As you know, expectations have a strong effect on medium-term inflation and, as a consequence, on steady-state interest rates. So, yes, absolutely, I don’t think the chronic low-inflation equilibrium we had before the pandemic will return.[end_answer] Well, it is important to recognise that it still requires work. We’re not yet at the level of interest rates needed to bring inflation back to 2 per cent in a timely manner. Governments also do need to pull back from the high deficits that remain. So, a significant fiscal adjustment will be needed in coming years. But, that adjustment should be a return to some normal situation, as opposed to a forced overcorrection.[end_answer] In the first years of the euro, big imbalances were built up. Then there was a painful correction from 2008 until about 2015 or 2016. I don’t think that this high volatility will be repeated on this occasion. It’s more a question of returning from this unusual pandemic situation to a more normal state of affairs. We haven’t seen “normal” in Europe for a long time.[end_answer] Here I’m going to repeat the point about data dependence. We’re working under very high uncertainty. Let’s just take one concrete example: compared to where we were in mid-December, when we had our last meeting, there have been big declines in energy prices. A lot of that has to do with mild weather in recent weeks. So, this is a simple example of why we must be open about where interest rates need to go.[end_answer] It’s still the case now in mid-January, that we run many scenarios about where interest rates are going to need to go. Under most of them, the vast majority of them, interest rates rates do have to be higher than they are now. As we discussed earlier, risks are not yet two-sided, and under a wide range of scenarios, it’s still safe to bring interest rates above where they are now. And this was the communication at our last meeting.[end_answer] Where exactly we end up will depend on a lot of factors.[end_answer] Let me go back to one thing you said earlier on, mechanical base effects mean that we do have inflation coming down a lot this year. So, for Q4 2023, our projection of inflation back in December 2022 was that we would be at around 3.6 per cent. Compared to being at 9 per cent at the end of 2022, that’s a fairly big decline. But it is mostly base effects. And then, in terms of interest rates, the question is how do you get from mid-threes at the end of 2023 to the 2 per cent target in a timely manner?[end_answer] That’s where interest rate policy is going to be important. It’s to make sure that the last kilometre of returning to target is delivered in a timely manner. So, what I would also say is that because we haven’t had so many tightening cycles in recent memory, another source for uncertainty is that the sensitivity of inflation to interest rates varies a lot across the different models we run.[end_answer] And this is why we would say, and the Fed would also say, that one of the big issues for this year is to observe the impact of the tightening we’ve already done. Last year we could say that it’s clear that we need to bring rates up to more normal levels, and now we say, well, actually we need to bring them into restrictive territory. But in terms of deciding where eventually the level is going to be, there will be a feedback loop from experience.[end_answer] What we would expect to see in the coming months is the impact of the interest rate hikes that happened last year for investment and consumption. In turn, that will help us decide how powerfully the interest rate hikes are affecting the real economy and the inflation dynamic.[end_answer] Anyone who says they know for sure what the right level of interest rates will be must, apart from everything else, have a lot of confidence in their model of how the world works. The prudent approach is, instead, to observe the feedback from the tightening last year.[end_answer] The policy rate only moved in the summer but the yield curve has been moving for a year. We are seeing the effects of this in the behaviour of banks, the bond market and the financial system. The interesting phase now is the response of firms, households and governments to the change in financial conditions.[end_answer] So, let me give you a two-level answer to that.[end_answer] The first level is that the biggest risk of fragmentation occurs when you have economic conditions that are misaligned across the EU area. And this is what we had prior to 2008. Because we had large differences in growth rates, current account deficits and credit conditions, in that first decade of the euro, many indicators showed a lot of divergence.[end_answer] And when the crunch came, the countries that needed to make a correction were going to have a number of years of difficult economic circumstances — low growth rates and shrinking economies. Those are the conditions in which risk of financial fragmentation would be most intense.[end_answer] A lot of measures were taken to reduce those fundamental differences. We have not seen large current account deficits in recent years, we have not seen large differences in fiscal deficits and we have not seen large differences in credit conditions. So, we do not have the ingredients for big divergence now, though this can always recur in the future, because there could be bad luck or bad policy choices.[end_answer] And let me add that during the pandemic, Europe also launched NextGenerationEU. So, there’s now jointly funded debt directed at the economies which suffered most in the pandemic. This is now going to be a big platform for reform and public investment in countries like Italy, Spain, Greece and so on. That’s one level.[end_answer] The second level is that over the past year there has been a significant change in the nominal and inflationary environment. That might have caught some investors by surprise. In the process of normalisation, there’s always the risk that there could be market accidents, there could be non-fundamental volatility.[end_answer] That is why we found it important to introduce an extra instrument — the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) — last summer. And that adds to our toolkit. Because we now have anex-anteprogramme. We have told the world that if we see non-fundamental volatility emerging we will be prepared to intervene, subject to a set of “good governance” criteria, which means that affected member countries are aligned with the European frameworks.[end_answer] In sum, in terms of fundamental forces of volatility or divergence, Europe looks to be in reasonably good shape, and in terms of non-fundamental volatility, which is a more elevated risk in a time of transition, we have expanded our toolkit, by having the TPI.[end_answer] Since the start of unconventional monetary policy it was clear that there was a potential risk. What happens if there’s a sudden change in the interest rate environment? So, in principle that is a risk factor.[end_answer] It has been greatly mitigated in the European context not just by banks, but also by individuals. There has been a lot of “macroprudential” regulation, in terms of limits on loan-to-value ratios, limits on debt-to-income ratios and so on. The ability to exploit super-low interest rates via excessive leverage might have existed in some pockets, but it was not pervasive.[end_answer] The evidence is that we’re not seeing very high vulnerability to the big change in interest rates. In the less regulated non-bank sectors of the financial system, losses may have accumulated. But we have a bank-based financial system and the banks are heavily supervised and regulated.[end_answer] For banks, rising interest rates help via some channels, such as net interest income. To the extent that the European economy is hurt by the slowdown, they face some risks in their loan books. But again, we think the European economy will be growing again in 2023. Our current assessment is that if there is a recession, it’s going to be mild and short lived.[end_answer] So, I’ll be cautiously optimistic that we’re able to make this transition away from “low for long” towards a more normal situation.[end_answer] But again, let me go back to the running theme of this conversation, which is high uncertainty. If it turns out that inflation is much stickier than expected, that there’s more of a downturn in the world economy, that higher interest rates have to be higher than is currently expected by the market, we will be keeping a perpetual eye on financial fragility.[end_answer] There are two parts to that analysis. One is whether, after this period of high inflation, the 2 per cent inflation target will be seen as credible by people in general. I think monetary policy can deliver that, by making sure inflation comes back to 2 per cent in a timely manner.[end_answer] But then, there is the second part, which is the implications for nominal assets and what assets people may wish to hold and what one means by the safety of “safe assets” after this inflation surprise?[end_answer] When you think about it, for me, it’s going to be more of a forward-looking question. First of all, I’m not going to disagree with you. Before the pandemic we had a negative inflation-risk premium. Interest rates were low not just because inflation was below target, but the risk distribution was seen as skewed to the downside. We would now expect to see an inflation risk premium being more substantial. People rationally update their beliefs about the world.[end_answer] It’s 40 years since we’ve seen this happen. And then the question is: how would that risk premium be priced? Is it going to be seen as a once in 40-year kind of risk factor? And with that kind of frequency, it’s not going to have that much effect. But, as you know, these kinds of rare events are priced by the market, to some extent. And we may see more of an inflationary risk premium, maybe more demand for index-linked products and so on.[end_answer] And that’s an open question.[end_answer] This is a multilevel debate. In the end, everything has to be anchored on sustainable debt levels. If debt levels are, in the medium-term, anchored at a moderate level, governments can respond aggressively to large shocks, such as the pandemic or the energy shock.[end_answer] So, any fiscal framework should be embedded in a clear debt anchor. Politically, it’s not easy to deliver a strategy that will reduce debt ratios over time. But it is essential.[end_answer] Let me add that a lot of the fiscal support in Europe consists of price subsidies, which are different from broad-based increases in government spending or broad-based reductions in taxes. The direct impact of fiscal policy is to lower inflation right now. But in our projections, it is expected to raise inflation in 2024 and 2025 when these subsidies are scheduled to be removed.[end_answer] So, when you look at what’s happening now, there are two different conversations. One is how fiscal policy is currently lowering inflation through subsidies, followed by the reversal of those subsidies later on. The other is the broader issue about the appropriate level of fiscal support in the economy.[end_answer] And what I said earlier on is true. We need to get to a normal situation where fiscal policy is not excessively loose. Because it’s hard to say you need expansionary fiscal policy when we have low unemployment. But we also don’t want to get to an excessively austere fiscal policy which would be an excessive drag on the economy.[end_answer] So, as I said earlier, we have not had “normal” in Europe for a long time. We really should be setting up a system to deliver a normal, stable, macroeconomic environment, including a normal, stable fiscal policy.[end_answer] Right, so we have to be forward looking about this. We have to have a situation where, there is consensus that debt ratios have to come down. And we do need a fiscal framework that supports governments in delivering a steady and sustained decline in debt ratios. It’s not going to be easy. But again, in order to have the room to be aggressive when you need to be, you need to return to safe fiscal positions when the opportunities arise.[end_answer] There’s a lot of value in the stability of the inflation target. So, for me, at this point, maintaining an exclusive focus on 2 per cent as the inflation target is the best strategy.[end_answer] So, what I would say is that where we are now is abnormal. We have essentially a big move away from state-provided money in favour of private sector alternatives.[end_answer] The anchor of the monetary system and the anchor of an electronic or digital monetary system should be a state-supplied digital currency. So, I’m very much in favour of having a digital currency. But, in the same way that currency is a relatively minor fraction of overall transactions, a digital euro is not intended to become the dominant way we transact. But a digital currency will allow Europe to have a more stable and secure digital economy. So, digital currency is necessary and desirable as an anchor for a generally digitalised economy.[end_answer] Absolutely. Yes, so it’s fair to say that the interest and the energy the ECB is putting into the digital euro is with conviction that this will not be a threat to the stability of the banking system.","['inflationary pressure', 'inflationary environment', 'disinflationary pressure', 'keeping inflation in', 'outright deflation', 'inflationary pressure', 'inflation came out',

516,2024-01-13,Interview with Corriere della Sera,Philip R. Lane,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2024/html/ecb.in240113~63455a0f8c.en.html,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini","The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?[end_question] What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?[end_question] Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?[end_question] The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?[end_question] Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?[end_question] Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?[end_question] Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?[end_question] Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?[end_question] There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?[end_question] Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?[end_question] EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?[end_question] Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?[end_question] Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?[end_question] Disclaimer","13 January 2024[end_answer] The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.[end_answer] Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.[end_answer] The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.[end_answer] Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.[end_answer] Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.[end_answer] I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.[end_answer] It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.[end_answer] For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.[end_answer] The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.[end_answer] For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.[end_answer] We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.[end_answer] Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.[end_answer] That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.[end_answer] A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.[end_answer] We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.[end_answer] It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.","['cool down inflation', 'easing of core inflation', 'high inflation',
