Just as the growth risks are on the downside on account of the evolution of oil prices so risks to inflation today are on the upside.,True,orientation,True,True
Quite apart from the price of oil we also need to take into consideration any potential rise in administered prices and indirect taxes in a number of countries in the euro area because that would push inflation up.,True,orientation,True,True

Answer We also have a level of dispersion of inflation from country to country which is similar to that seen in the United States.,False,,True,False
That is the reason why when we observe a that unit labour costs which is the major cost parameter for inflation are augmenting in a country year after year and that they are above the average of the euro area and b that the level of cost competitiveness of the economy concerned is starting to create difficulties for instance that the external account is deteriorating visàvis the average of the euro area then it is time in our opinion to take appropriate measures to bring the unit labour costs below the average and catch up on the lost competitiveness.,True,orientation,True,True

I will tell you why in order to preserve a level of medium and longterm market interest rates that is exceptionally favourable to growth and job creation we have to solidly anchor inflation expectations at a level that is fully in line with our definition of price stability.,True,machine,True,False
This means that economic agents may incorporate in their price setting the wrong assumption that the higher headline inflation due to oil price increases will last in the medium and long run.,True,disease,True,True

It is extraordinarily important to anchor inflation expectations not just on a medium term basis but also in the longterm and even the very longterm.,True,machine,True,True
The remarkable success of the ECB Governing Council is that it has anchored expectations from the very beginning in line with our definition of price stability less than 2 close to 2 inflation.,True,machine,True,True
Otherwise their inflation expectations would not be in line with our definition of price stability.,True,other,True,True
Our monetary policy concept calls on us to counter inflationary risks in the medium term and be credible in delivering price stability over time.,True,warfare,True,True
That is the reason why so many countries in the industrial world and in the emerging economies have adopted a concept of direct inflation targeting.,True,warfare,True,True

At the level of the euro area we have had inflation under control since the introduction of the euro.,True,warfare,True,True
In 1999 the estimates by international organisations of noninflationary potential growth in the euro area ranged between 2.0 and 2.5. In 20042005 the same organisations considered that potential growth was close to the lower limit of this range and even slightly below 2.0. However I believe that in the light of recent developments in the labour market the increase in the rate of utilisation of the labour force and indications of a slight pickup in trend productivity growth the potential growth of the euro area economy over the next couple of years might be somewhat higher but only marginally it remains close to though possibly slightly above 2.0. In the absence of further economic reforms to enhance market flexibility and adaptability and raise labour utilisation and productivity at a faster pace the growth seen last year cannot be sustained without causing inflationary pressures.,False,,False,False
The euro area economy is reaching peak levels of capacity utilisation and the rate of unemployment is today 7.5 a level which according to various estimates is considered as consistent with noninflationary longterm growth.,True,orientation,True,True
Precisely to enable the economy to further reduce unemployment in a sustained manner that is without creating inflationary pressures.,True,disease,True,True
The ECBs Governing Council will assess the outlook for inflation over the medium term and the potential risks to price stability in order to prevent the upside risks on the horizon from materialising.,True,orientation,True,True
The emphasis on the medium term is particularly important in the short term inflation is in fact likely to fall in the coming months as a result of the effects of special factors subsequently however inflation is expected to rise again in the course of the year as the favourable influence of these factors dissipates.,True,orientation,True,True
The fall in the price of oil may prove to be temporary the danger that past increases in the price of oil and other commodities will have a stronger passthrough into consumer prices the likelihood of overly generous increases in wages not in line with productivity gains at a time of robust economic growth and as the unemployment rate is reaching a level that can generate inflationary pressures and lastly continuing strong money and credit growth.,True,disease,True,True
As the Governor of the independent Banque de France which became fully independent on 1 January 1994 I had together with my colleagues on the Conseil de la Politique Monétaire conducted a monetary policy which resulted in inflation in France averaging 1.4 per year in the five years prior to 1 January 1999.,False,,False,False
According to our definition that means keeping annual inflation below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
As a result of these economies entering into the world market there have already been periods during which they have fostered disinflation i.e. very low or falling prices of manufactured goods which have then been followed by periods where they have triggered inflation through energy and commodity price increases.,True,animal,True,True
The same applies to the second challenge of scientific and technological progress a significant increase in productivity triggered by the advent of new technologies means that costs and prices change in the economy as does the assessment of inflation risks by the central bank.,True,warfare,True,True
You then had a very low level of spread a very low level of volatility and a very low level of risk premia which contributed to create an asset bubble asset price inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
Taking into account the alleviation of inflationary pressures we have to be very mindful of the spreads that we are still observing in the money market.,True,disease,True,True
Concretely the ECB aims at maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
This record compares favourably with the average inflation rate of 3 that was achieved in the member countries during the nine years preceding the introduction of the euro.,True,other,True,True
It also permits to avoid inflationary pressures.,True,disease,True,True
To the contrary we will do all what is necessary for inflation to go down back to our definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
I also mentioned that we had no further indication for our future interest rates that we are never precommitted and that we will do in the future what is appropriate to deliver price stability in the mediumterm and to be credible in doing so since this is essential to anchoring inflation expectations.,False,,False,False
I trust that all central banks are doing what is necessary to counter inflationary pressures and to be credible in the delivery of price stability over time.,True,warfare,True,True
To deliver price stability in the medium term is necessary for five reasons first it is what the European democracies have asked us to do when they created the ECB second it is what our fellow citizens are asking us to do in the present circumstances third it is particularly necessary for the most vulnerable and the poorest segment of society fourth it is a necessary precondition for sustainable growth and job creation and fifth it is particularly important to solidly anchor inflation expectations in a period of financial market tensions and volatility.,False,,True,True
But we must avoid that prices that depend on us for instance prices of services or the wages and salaries would augment abnormally as if the present abnormal level of inflation would last.,True,disease,True,True
I mean all the price increases that would be wrongly based on the hypothesis that the inflation would remain as high as it is today in the years to come.,True,orientation,True,True
First core inflation is higher than that and secondly we do not consider core inflation as a good predictor of future inflation.,False,,False,False
Unit Labour Costs are an important indicator of future inflation because they are a major cost in the euro area economy.,False,,False,False
In its first nine years annual inflation in the euro area averaged 2.1 and over these nine years the euro area has created 15.7 million jobs almost three times more than in the previous nine years before the euro and one million more jobs than were created in the United States over the same period.,False,,True,True
The latest surveys suggest that inflation is now the major economic concern of European citizens.,False,,True,False

When we analyse the monetary situation we look also with great attention to credit growth which might feed asset inflation.,True,plant,True,True
Because there are only two ways to isolate the households from this real transfer which is unavoidable either you ask the enterprises to pay for it and you weaken considerably the productive sector or you ask the budget to pay for it and you weaken dramatically the situation of public finances or you do both! But this has been on the occasion of the first oil shock and would be so in the present circumstances a recipe for high spiralling inflation high unemployment and stagnation.,True,disease,True,True
Firstly in anchoring solidly inflationary expectations the ECB is preserving a financial environment which is favourable for sustainable growth and job creation.,True,plant,True,True
Because all medium and long term market rates are lower all things being equal if inflation expectations are in line with our definition less than 2 but close to 2.,False,,True,False
In my eyes the acceleration of the appreciation of the Yuan would be in the interest of the Chinese partners themselves because it will help to diminish inflationary tensions in China.,True,disease,True,True
The European Central Bank has a mandate which is to deliver price stability to be credible in delivering of price stability over the medium term and to solidly anchor inflationary expectations.,True,machine,True,True
This is something that is very important for future sustainable growth and job creation in Europe and also very important in a period of turbulences because in solidly anchoring inflationary expectations we contribute to the stability of financial markets of European financial markets and we diminish the potential volatility of these markets.,True,machine,True,True
We trust that by delivering price stability in the medium term and by being credible in the delivery of price stability in the medium term we anchor inflationary expectations.,True,machine,True,True
As regards the headline consumer price index I utilised the expression of a protracted period of high level of inflation which will be progressively reduced in the course of the year to go down over the medium term to our definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
And the idea that we could have a medium to long term tradeoff between inflation and growth is now rejected and that is the reason why you either have a monetary policy concept of our own kind in Europe or the socalled inflation targeting concept which is very much generalised around the world and which is underpinned by exactly the same idea by giving the central bank the task of delivering price stability we pave the way for sustainable growth and job creation.,True,plant,True,True
But equally no call for a decrease of rates and we will in the future do whatever is necessary to solidly anchor inflation expectations and we know that in so doing we pave the way for sustainable growth and job creation.,True,plant,True,True

For example in my country in 1992 and 1993 as Secretary of the Treasury and Governor of the Banque de France I had to pursue a longterm strategy of competitive disinflation at the same time as being faced with monetary crises in the European exchange rate mechanism.,True,sports,True,True
Our credibility has helped us solidly anchoring inflation expectations which has also proved very important in the crisis we have avoided the materialisation of deflationary risks thanks to this solid anchoring.,True,machine,True,True
It is this credibility which has enabled us to solidly anchor inflation expectations.,True,machine,True,True
This has helped us to avoid inflation and at the same time has also protected us from the materialisation of the risk of deflation during the recent crisis period.,True,warfare,True,True
I trust that we are credible in this promise to be faithful to our mandate and that is the reason why we are solidly anchoring inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True

When you look at what has been extracted from financial markets and compare with the U.S. you see we are benefiting from more solid anchoring of inflation expectations.,True,machine,True,True
One has to fully understand that in a single currency area which ensures price stability in line with the definition given by the ECB annual inflation less than two but close to two percent it is imperative for each economy belonging to this area to ensure that national increases of wages of unit labour costs and of prices are broadly in line with the euro area average.,True,machine,True,True
A simple calculation shows that assuming an inflation rate of below 2 but close to 2 as in the ECBs definition of price stability and a reasonable average yearly real GDP growth rate for instance slightly over 1 a balanced budget which is the normal position according to the Stability and Growth Pact might reduce the debt outstanding as a proportion of GDP by more than 3 each year for a debt level of around 120 of GDP.,False,,False,False

Since the single currency was introduced inflation in Germany has stood at only 1.5 per year! And in the euro area as a whole it has been 1.97 which is less than but close to 2! The ECB is the guardian of the euro and represents an anchor of confidence and stability in Europe.,False,,False,False

I think that this solid anchoring of inflation expectations and the credibility of the ECB to deliver price stability in the medium term is positive for all countries in the euro area including those that have adjustments to implement.,True,other,True,True
In particular if we were not credible the medium and longterm interest rates would incorporate a higher level of inflation expectations and therefore these market interest rates would also be higher everywhere in the euro area.,True,other,True,False

It is very important that national governments fully take into account the fact that monetary policy is designed to ensure inflation of less than 2 but close to 2 as an average for the euro area and that they take their own national economic policy decisions in the light of this.,True,other,True,True
Trichet The biggest achievement of the ECB is to be able to tell 331 million fellow citizens that 12 years after the introduction of the euro we have average yearly inflation of 1.97 which is fully in line with what the democracies in Europe have asked for fully in line with our primary mandate and with our definition of price stability.,True,other,True,True

Question What are the main reasons for the rising inflation in the euro area?,False,,False,False
From my point of view Monetary Union has worked well we have delivered price stability fully in line with our definition of below but close to 2 during the first 12 years of the euro the euro is a solid and credible currency and inflation expectations are solidly anchored over a horizon of five or ten years.,True,other,True,True
If in 1998 we had been told that for the 12 first years of the euro we would have a single currency that keeps remarkably its value with average inflation below 2 a better result than in any Member State in the past 50 years many people would probably have said that it was too good to be true.,True,other,True,True

It is doubtful that the citizens of southern Europe understand the rise in rates resulting from the threat of inflation.,True,warfare,True,True

We decided to raise rates to counter an unwelcome increase in inflation expectations.,True,warfare,True,True
By taking that step we confirmed that we are extremely determined to anchor inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True

What matters in particular is that medium to long term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability.,True,machine,True,True
We are very well aware that price pressures are likely to remain subdued for a prolonged period of time but we expect inflation rates to converge again towards 2 per cent as the cyclical upswing of the economy takes hold.,True,orientation,True,True

What is important for us is that average inflation in the euro area as a whole returns to our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
We cut interest rates last month because we came to the conclusion that inflation would stay below target for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
We are confident that inflation will gradually come back to 2 mainly because the euro area economy will come out of recession.,True,orientation,True,True

To some extent this risk is already materialising companies are starting to adjust to a1 growth1 inflation economy.,True,disease,True,True
The big risk is that this growth pessimism perpetuates the current situation of weak growth and low inflation.,True,disease,True,True
We have always emphasised that there are two contingencies for further action first our measures taken so far have not been enough to have the intended effect that is are not sufficiently sizeable in terms of expanding our balance sheet to provide the stimulus that is necessary in current conditions and second the inflation outlook itself has deteriorated since we decided on the measures we took in the past.,True,disease,True,True
And the Eurosystem staff have also substantially revised downwards their inflation projections.,True,orientation,True,True
That would create less distortion of relative prices and the impact on inflation would be bigger but also bring a higher degree of risksharing across the union as well as more moral hazard.,True,other,True,True
But at the same time you would need much bigger volumes to have the desired impact on inflation.,True,other,True,True
With the recent oil prices inflation would be even lower even substantially lower than expected so far.,True,orientation,True,True
This is especially true for 2015 when the effect would amount to 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points which could mean negative inflation during a substantial part of 2015.,True,orientation,True,True
Others might say and I personally lean towards that argument that in an environment in which headline inflation might become negative and in which inflation expectations are extremely fragile we cannot simply look through.,True,disease,True,True

This price competition could also depress core inflation and contribute to the deanchoring of inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
For 2015 our staff projections expect an inflation rate of just 0.7. Since the projections were prepared however oil prices have fallen by about another 15.,False,,True,True

The actual rate of inflation affects inflation expectations which in turn influence the decisions of businesses on prices and wages.,False,,True,False
First of all we are not the only central bank in the world to have set itself an inflation objective around 2.,True,other,True,False
All the leading central banks have decided that for them price stability is achieved with an inflation rate of around 2.,False,,True,True
This is for several reasons first on measurement and statistical grounds inflation indices tend to exaggerate actual inflation so that an index of zero would in fact mean a negative rate.,False,,False,False
More importantly should the ECB aim for 0 inflation we would probably have to provoke permanent negative inflation rates in some countries to balance out the positive rates in other countries.,False,,False,False
Thats also why it makes sense to set an inflation objective of 2.,False,,True,False
Finally with an inflation objective of 0 the risk that the economy slips into deflation is high.,False,,True,False
The economy is left too close to a deflationary experience and is vulnerable to any shock.,True,disease,True,True

Not all euro area countries are facing a risk of deflation.,False,,True,False
This creates scope for wage increases which counteract the threat of deflation.,True,warfare,True,True
A few months with negative inflation rates do not mean deflation.,False,,True,False

There is a risk that inflation expectations are no longer anchored.,True,machine,True,True
If inflation is very low and growth too it becomes increasingly difficult to service these debts and that hinders the economic recovery.,True,disease,True,True

At the same timeinflation has continued trending down.,True,orientation,True,True
In November annual inflation in the euro area fell to a cyclical low of 0.3 largely owing to the sharp fall in oil prices since the end of the summer.,True,orientation,True,True
But falling core inflation which excludes volatile energy and food prices also points to weak aggregate demand.,True,orientation,True,True
Falling oil prices and the prospect of a prolonged period of low inflation also seem to have affected inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
Given the potency of the recent oilprice shock the risk is that inflation may temporarily slip into negative territory in the coming months.,True,orientation,True,True
After all because wellanchored inflation expectations are indispensable for mediumterm price stability monetary policy must respond to a risk of deanchoring.,True,machine,True,True
That is why the ECB Governing Council has reiterated its unanimous commitment to use additional unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to address a prolonged period of low inflation or should the monetary stimulus fall short of our intention to move our balance sheet toward its size in early 2012.,True,machine,True,True
What has changed is the confirmation of low growth and low inflation and the oil shock which is obviously new.,False,,False,False

WSJ Is an inflation rate of 2 even achievable in the eurozone?,False,,False,False
Mr. Cœuré I may be old fashioned but I still believe that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon and so the question is more how fast do we go back to 2 and what is the kind of shock that keeps us from 2.,True,orientation,True,True
It is also true that in the eurozone we have an environment where markets are more rigid than in the U.S. and U.K. So it is likely that given any particular shock inflation will take more time to go back to our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB is committed to taking additional measures if we face the prospect of inflation being too low for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
Thats a concern but what matters are the inflation expectations for the medium term.,True,other,True,True
The fall in oil prices is bringing general inflation down but the impact also depends on the rate of the euro against the dollar.,True,orientation,True,True

Most recently against the backdrop of a persistently weak inflation outlook slowing growth momentum and subdued monetary and credit dynamics we decided in early September to adopt a number of additional monetary policy initiatives which will complete and complement the measures already announced in June.,True,disease,True,True
On the basis of our current information we expect inflation to remain at low levels before gradually increasing during 2015 and 2016.,True,orientation,True,True

We see risk of too low inflation for too long a time and for the euro area as a whole as Ive said many times our recovery is modest weak uneven and fragile but its not recession.,True,disease,True,True
The ECB will continue to have a very expansionary monetary policy for an extended period of time until we see the rate of inflation going close to 2 and thats something that should be counted upon.,True,machine,True,True
Let me tell you we have a mandate and we have to comply with this and this mandate does require the ECB to bring inflation back below 2.,True,machine,True,True
Growth and inflation are low debt and unemployment remain too high.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECBs Vice President talks about the power and the limits of the central bank the risks of very low inflation and the strong criticism in Germany BZ Mr Constâncio many politicians and observers view the power and the instruments of the ECB in its fight against low inflation and a weak recovery as almost unlimited but others say the ECB is already reaching its limits.,True,warfare,True,True
But if one is talking about inflation it is different It is the responsibility of monetary policy to reach the inflation goal that is the fundamental creed of monetary theory and of central banks.,True,orientation,True,True

What really matters are medium to longerterm inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
Now it is also starting to attain the inflation expectations in five years for the following five years.,True,orientation,True,True
And that also means the risk of deflation in the euro area has increased?,True,disease,True,False
I dont see a risk of an actual deflation in the sense of a broadbased decline in prices.,False,,True,False
But the big problem at the moment is a prolonged period of low nominal growth so low inflation and low growth.,True,disease,True,True
But the new ECB projections for growth and inflation have been revised only marginally.,True,other,True,True
The risks to the downside for growth and inflation were seen as more important by the Governing Council.,True,orientation,True,True
This is particularly the case if there is a risk to inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
On the one hand it influences the inflation expectations for the future and on the other hand it triggers shifts in investors decisions.,True,other,True,True
Last weeks decision was not unanimous although it is always stressed that the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to do what is necessary against the risks of low inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
We are justified to do so because of the difficult situation of low inflation we are in.,True,disease,True,True
Now the same applies to the euro area although in a different scale We are not in deflation and we will not be in deflation.,True,disease,True,True
Just to give one example When we started buying some government bonds for the first time in 2010 everybody was writing in Germany about the forthcoming hyperinflation.,True,disease,True,True
I find it difficult to say that the ECB is deviating from a stabilityoriented policy when inflation rates are at 0.3. You could say so if inflation was at 3 or 4.,True,orientation,True,True
It is a fact that the environment is such that the neutral real interest rate that means the interest at which real GDP is growing at its trend rate and inflation is stable That this rate is negative at the moment and that it will be very low or even negative for quite a while.,True,orientation,True,True
Q The ECBs projections envisage less growth and lower inflation.,False,,True,False
The ECB staff projections for 2014 and 2015 have been revised downwards both in respect of growth and inflation and the Governing Council is also seeing risks to growth being on the downside.,True,orientation,True,True

No inflation is low it is too weak but we are not in a Japaneselike situation.,True,disease,True,True
In the case of Japanese deflation most prices were falling.,True,orientation,True,True
In the euro area weak inflation comes firstly from energy and food prices which are low then from the effects of the crisis on consumption and investment.,True,disease,True,True
It is also caused which was to be expected by the adjustments ongoing in some countries after years of too high inflation notably in terms of wages and more recently from the strength of the euro.,True,disease,True,True
At the ECB we monitor price changes of course notably to avoid the danger of overly weak inflation and we want to support activity by the recovery of credit.,True,disease,True,True
In addition as you also know we have very low rates of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
That would be so if in addition to interest rate adjustments there were not also other measures which ultimately can be used to influence the rate of inflation and economic growth.,True,machine,True,False
And if at the end of the day the economic environment is so weak that economic growth cannot be generated then we at the ECB must consider how we can ensure that economic growth is generated and that inflation rises from the as mentioned very low inflation rate of 0.3? How can we ensure that jobs are safe and remain or that new jobs are created?,True,orientation,True,True
In our projections inflation is too low over too long a period of time.,True,orientation,True,True
That means if we have inflation that is too low with all the dangers that I have already described to you then we must also respond to that.,True,disease,True,True
We have had to significantly revise our inflation forecasts for 2014 trimming them from 1.1 to 0.7 since December 2013.,True,other,True,True
Low inflation is no longer caused purely by adjustments in certain euro area countries and by lower energy and food prices.,True,other,True,True
With rates of inflation that are too low month after month our comfort zone for reaching the target of price inflation close to 2 over the medium term has shrunk.,True,orientation,True,True
And if you were to ask me about the probability of a deflationary scenario becoming a reality my response would be that there is very little risk of this happening in the euro area.,True,other,True,True
Nonetheless the risks of a prolonged period of low inflation have been identified by the ECB.,True,disease,True,True
The Governing Council of the ECB is unanimous in its commitment to using unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.,True,disease,True,True
The low interest rates are justified because growth in Europe is weak and the inflation rate is going to remain well below the target rate of just under 2 for several years.,True,orientation,True,True
But even in this country inflation has fallen noticeably.,True,orientation,True,True
If inflation in the medium term is higher than the target of close to but below 2 we are concerned.,True,orientation,True,True
We are constantly asking ourselves why inflation is so low in the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
Later US dollar prices of these products stabilised but the euro appreciated causing inflation to fall still further.,True,orientation,True,True
Higher oil prices are sure to have an impact on inflation at least if we do not experience a further appreciation of the euro.,True,orientation,True,True
Incidentally one has to acknowledge that too low inflation while being generally negative for growth and especially so in the euro area does support real disposable incomes.,True,orientation,True,True
We have not seen any deflation in the sense of prices declining across the whole spectrum in the euro area with households and firms postponing consumption and investment because they are waiting for lower prices.,True,orientation,True,False
What we do see is that low inflation persists for a long time.,True,orientation,True,True
In a situation of low inflation wages in these countries need to really decline in absolute terms in order to improve their competitiveness.,True,orientation,True,True
Certainly that is yet another consequence of low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The reduction of debt levels which is of great importance in large parts of the euro area becomes more difficult in the event of low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
That would be the answer to the third situation that I mentioned in Amsterdam a deterioration of inflation expectations over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In the 1970s 1980s and 1990s we experienced a whole number of currency devaluations with often high inflation as a result.,False,,False,False
We currently have a formidable degree of price stability a low rate of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
At the same time inflation is low.,False,,True,True
We consider the risk of deflation to be very low.,False,,True,False
But the rate of inflation 0.7 in the euro area in April is rather far from our inflation objective consistent with price stability which is about 2.,False,,True,False
Second it will be important to know whether this period of low inflation wont be excessively prolonged.,False,,True,False
If the uneven pace of economic recovery in the euro area is confirmed and if we see a risk of inflation being too low for too long we can take action in June.,True,orientation,True,True
A lot depends on the forthcoming economic data and on our staff growth and inflation projections which are to be released in June.,False,,True,False
We are gradually moving out of the crisis phase into a different environment with the focus shifting from solving the crisis to ensuring stable economic growth and inflation close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Our primary mandate is price stability and within this mandate the exchange rate of the euro is among the factors determining the level of inflation.,False,,True,False
And indeed the strong euro is contributing to the current low inflation.,False,,True,False
Consequently any further strengthening of the euro strengthens the case for more policy action by the ECB aimed at bringing inflation closer to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We understand this to mean an inflation rate of close to but below 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
The rate of inflation in the euro area currently stands at 0.7. Such a small increase in prices cannot be regarded as satisfactory over the medium term if we want to attain what we have announced.,True,other,True,True
People must be able to rely on our keeping the annual rate of inflation at close to but below 2.That is important for them to take business decisions.,True,orientation,True,True
That is why we cannot allow inflation to deviate lastingly from our designated target figure irrespective of whether to the upside or the downside.,True,orientation,True,True
According to our current projections new ones will be presented in June it is only at the end of 2016 that inflation will approach the mark of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
And what we have observed recently are rather surprises to the downside which means that inflation has tended to be slightly lower than expected over the past few months.,True,orientation,True,True
The longer this increase in inflation is delayed the greater is the risk of a change in inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
This would cause firms and households to take very low inflation rates for granted and to behave accordingly.,True,other,True,True
That is why we cannot allow inflation to remain too low for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
There is no central bank that would aim for an inflation rate of zero over the medium term not even the Bundesbank has done so in the past.,True,other,True,True
Normally the goal of monetary policy is to have a moderate rate of inflation.,True,other,True,True
This could be regarded as a margin of safety to avoid the risk of deflation which would have grave repercussions for growth and employment.,True,disease,True,True
In a monetary union moderate inflation would also facilitate necessary economic adjustment.,True,other,True,True
Expressed in a simplified manner moderate inflation thus ensures that wages and salaries fall in real terms even when they remain nominally unchanged.,True,orientation,True,True
What we want to prevent however is that this turns into a lasting change in inflation expectations for the euro area.,True,other,True,True
In the prevailing environment of low euro area inflation any appreciation of the currency there is problematic for the whole area because a strong euro would make imports cheaper and push inflation down even further.,True,orientation,True,True
We are interested first and foremost in the impact of the exchange rate on inflation.,True,other,True,True
But I believe that such purchases would only be made if business activity and inflation develop along lines that are significantly worse than expected.,True,other,True,True
The important thing for us is to know whether the level of the euro exchange rate and its outlook are likely to hinder the return of inflation rates to below but close to 2 which is our definition of price stability and which lies at the heart of our mandate.,True,orientation,True,True
There is no doubt that the appreciation of the euro since the summer of 2012 has contributed to the current low level of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Yes the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using unconventional instruments including QE if the current period of low inflation extends for longer than expected.,True,orientation,True,True
We do not consider that necessary at present because the low level of inflation is partly due to temporary factors and we believe in the recovery inflation should therefore increase.,True,disease,True,True
In a period of low inflation the effects of exchange rate developments are closely monitored.,True,orientation,True,True
Moreover inflation expectations are still firmly anchored in the medium term.,True,other,True,True
When assessing the current inflation rate you always have to take into consideration all underlying reasons.,True,other,True,True
Today our assessment is that with the recovery that we are seeing now inflation will converge in the medium to long term and in saying this I admit that the price pressures are quite weak.,True,orientation,True,True
We do not see a risk of deflation but we admit that the pressures on prices are weak and that this weakness in price development is extending to the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
The Governing Councils assumption is that the rate of inflation will gradually increase towards our target of close to but below 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We are however closer to the area where inflation expectations could be altered and create downside risks to price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
So we are very vigilant regarding risks to our baseline scenario which envisages inflation slowly going back to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In the uncertain environment with the euro area in transition and the participating economies undergoing a lot of structural change it is very important that the ECB sticks to its inflation objective and maintains its credibility as an anchor for the reform efforts in Europe.,True,other,True,True
We know that inflation which is too high can be detrimental for the economy as it can lead to destabilising feedback loops for instance through wage settlements and price indexation and ultimately erode trust in the currency.,True,disease,True,True
But very low inflation can also be destabilising.,True,disease,True,True
Thats why inflation which is too low is also contrary to price stability as it can create a selffulfilling spiral of expectations that prices will continue falling.,True,orientation,True,True
This is the definition of deflation.,True,other,True,False
So we want to be in the safe area between high inflation and deflation and below but close to 2 is exactly the right level.,True,orientation,True,True
My personal definition of price stability is a rate of inflation which does not distort economic behaviour.,True,other,True,True
The Governing Council has confirmed its main scenario of a steady recovery with inflation gradually moving back towards our policy objective of below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
First let me take one step back and say we're not seeing deflation in the euro zone.,True,orientation,True,True
We see low inflation slowly increasing from the current low levels back to below but close to 2 percent.,True,orientation,True,True
Certainly we have upside risks and downside risks and we are alert to the notion that we are close to the region where a downside shift in our inflation path could bring us into dangerous areas so we have to be prepared.,True,orientation,True,True
But again this is not a discussion on deflation.,True,other,True,True
It is a discussion on how low can inflation be without triggering adverse dynamics.,True,other,True,True
Then we have other shocks that would change our mediumterm inflation path and then we have other instruments.,True,other,True,True
It's too early to tell whether what we are seeing in global financial markets today can lead to disruptions that can prompt a change in either our growth scenario or our inflation scenario or whether this is a shift in global demand that would have to take place anyway and that can be managed in a smooth way by the international community.,True,other,True,True
In our baseline scenario the forces coming from the real economy i.e. the ongoing strengthening in aggregate demand are enough to countervail disinflationary forces.,True,warfare,True,True
You first have to ask yourself what are the causes for low inflation and in particular whether downward pressures on prices come from the demand or the supply side.,True,orientation,True,True
Certainly aggregate demand is weak which explains a lot the low level of inflation.,True,other,True,True
This also contributes to the low inflationary pressures but on this front there is nothing monetary policy can do and there is nothing monetary policy should do because it is a healthy adjustment in these economies.,True,other,True,True
More seriously we are confident that the baseline scenario is a safe one in terms of inflation coming back to 2 percent.,True,orientation,True,True
But if the conclusion of the Governing Council discussion is that we see a significant risk that inflation does not come back to 2 percent even in the medium term then of course we will have to act and we certainly stand ready to do it.,True,other,True,True
Because deflation is a dynamic concept.,True,other,True,True
It has to do with expectations and it has to do with both inflation and output.,True,other,True,True
One measure of deflation is private agents in the economy postponing their decisions to invest or consume and these are by essence macroeconomic dynamics that can only be observed at the euro zone level because our economies are not closed economies.,True,other,True,True
Within a monetary union with a single market for goods services and capital which is our situation you cannot have a deflationary spiral at the level of one single country.,True,disease,True,True
You can have relative price adjustment but you cannot have a deflationary spiral.,True,disease,True,True
That's the best evidence that we don't have deflation.,True,other,True,True
And an inflation threshold is not feasible in my view because the euro area is undergoing deep structural change that shifts the relationships between economic variables.,True,other,True,True
We saw that the inflation path was lower and we acted and as a result of it the credibility of our forward guidance became stronger.,True,orientation,True,True
What we do not see frankly is deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
First we have learnt from Japans experience in 1990s that it is much more difficult to operate monetary policy when inflation goes close to zero.,True,orientation,True,True
Moreover due to measuring errors during periods of very low inflation you may think that inflation is still in positive territory whereas in fact it might be below zero.,True,orientation,True,True
Finally for countries that want to adjust their external imbalances it is much more difficult to become competitive again if you have very low inflation compared to near to 2 inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
If there is no inflation they have to lower the levels of their nominal wages and prices.,True,orientation,True,False
That is why most central banks target inflation of just under 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Disinflation currently has two causes.,True,other,True,True
Another aspect of disinflation however can be attributed to the very different and fragmented financing conditions in the euro area.,True,other,True,True
The risks of deflation or inflation are limited at this point in time.,True,other,True,True
In the US for example and certainly in the euro area the recovery after the crisis has not been accompanied by inflationary pressures unemployment is too high for that and production capacities are underutilised.,True,disease,True,True
One of the fears in Germany was that this would in the end cause inflation.,True,disease,True,True
And we are absolutely clear looking through shortterm developments that we are serious about our inflation objective and that its a symmetric objective.,True,other,True,True
If we have a strong sense that anything impacts the mediumterm scenario and moves our mediumterm inflation expectation further away from 2 percent then there would have to be a monetary policy reaction.,True,orientation,True,True
The best way to do this is to deliver on our inflation mandate.,True,other,True,True
Coming to monetary policy we have the scenario of a slowly developing growth inflation slowly coming back to the 2 percent number over the medium term but there are risks around this baseline scenario.,True,plant,True,True
They relate to our price stability mandate and to our policy aim of maintaining inflation below but close to the 2 percent number.,True,other,True,True
We want to be sure that price stability will be delivered in the medium term and we want to make sure that inflation expectations in Europe remain anchored.,True,machine,True,True
We are very attentive to any sign that inflation expectations in Europe would be deanchored because that would be following the Japanese path that we dont want the euro zone to follow.,True,machine,True,True
But it has always been recognized by the ECB from inception that the path through which inflation reverts back to the 2 percent number depends on the nature of the shock and it depends on the type of nominal rigidities that you have in the economy.,True,orientation,True,True
In the current situation where you have this enormous structural adjustment going on and enormous deleveraging pressures that are obviously weighing a lot on prices contributing to the subdued price pressures it is only normal that we see inflation coming back more slowly to the medium term objective.,True,orientation,True,True
This is temporary and should not be confused with deflation.,True,other,True,True
Mechanically this relative price adjustment weighs down on the average eurozone inflation number.,True,machine,True,False
For all these reasons inflationary pressures will be very subdued for an extended period of time.,True,disease,True,True
The mandate is price stability which we defined in 2003 as an inflation rate below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
We do not want inflation to be too high above our target.,True,orientation,True,True
You could of course question whether price stability does not mean 0 inflation.,False,,True,False
But you should also ask yourself why almost all major central banks have an inflation target of around 2.,False,,False,False
First measuring inflation accurately is difficult and both experience and the literature show that inflation numbers have a tendency to be higher than inflation actually is.,False,,True,False
When statisticians say that inflation is 0 it is highly probable that it is in fact below 0.,False,,True,False
In addition when inflation goes down real interest rates rise.,True,orientation,True,True
In view of the decline in potential growth and productivity in the developed economies it is estimated that the real equilibrium interest rate which provides full employment without creating inflation is currently negative in the United States and probably also in the euro area.,False,,False,False
When inflation is so low it is difficult to bring the economy into balance.,True,orientation,True,True
Wages cannot simply be lowered when inflation falls.,True,orientation,True,True
But what really counts are real interest rates what is left after deducting inflation.,False,,False,False
In Germany for example the real interest rate on deposits in 2007 was around 0 because interest rates of 2.2 were offset by inflation of 2.4. Now it is 0 again.,False,,False,False
Interest rates will only rise when growth and inflation pick up again.,True,orientation,True,True
The decisive thing for us is the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
Over 15 years we have achieved an inflation rate of 1.9 on average i.e. below but close to 2.,False,,True,False
The deviation of inflation expectations from our mediumterm target is what counts for us.,True,orientation,True,False
I have always said that I do not believe that the euro area as a whole could slide into deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
But as I said even inflation that is positive but too low poses significant risks.,True,orientation,True,True
It weighs on inflation expectations if it persists which then has an impact on wage and price decisions.,True,orientation,True,True
Letting the programme end in September 2016 would probably not have been enough to bring inflation to where we want it to be by the end of 2017.,True,orientation,True,True
When potential growth picks up and inflation rises they will be a thing of the past.,True,orientation,True,True
Now however this instrument is being tried in many countries because normal interest rates are close to zero and central banks are faced with the problem that the real equilibrium interest rate is negative and inflation is so low.,True,orientation,True,True
For us it is an inflation rate that is below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
That would help to normalise inflation worldwide.,True,orientation,True,True
Everyone understands that both central banks are reacting to their domestic situations to growth employment inflation.,False,,True,True
No central bank is changing its inflation target at the moment and we are not considering anything like that either.,False,,False,False
We would have had recessionary deflation in many parts of the euro area.,True,disease,True,True
However it is indeed the case that it is more difficult to measure inflation today than it was 15 or 30 years ago.,True,other,True,True
There are factors which we over and underestimate when it comes to inflation.,True,other,True,True
There were deflationary risks.,True,disease,True,True
There are a number of countries which are still in the adjustment process and experiencing deflation.,True,disease,True,True
Greece has been in a deflationary recession for five years.,True,disease,True,True
And the euro area as a whole was threatened by this deflationary scenario.,True,disease,True,True
However the exchange rate does have a major impact on inflation and growth.,True,other,True,True
Firstly when it comes to our inflation objective Im really determined.,True,other,True,True
The impact on inflation however seems to be taking longer.,True,other,True,True
We have already pushed back several times our expectations of when the inflation rate will reach just under 2.,True,orientation,True,True
For instance they dont regard the development in inflation expectations as being so dramatic.,True,plant,True,True
Others say that because of the special nature of a currency union such asset purchases should only be used if we are in a deflationary situation.,True,disease,True,True
A large majority of the Council members which includes me think that if you deal with that only in the extreme circumstances of deflation then its too late.,True,disease,True,True
On the inflation side the return to closetotwopercent is at risk of being pushed backwards again.,True,orientation,True,True
I know that today we just had the final data for October for inflation we had 1.1 for the core inflation and 0.1 for headline inflation.,False,,False,False
But this has to be seen in a context where we had repeatedly overestimated future inflation rates.,True,other,True,True
If you observe for example that the price people are ready to pay for protection against inflation is zero or very low that's not necessarily a good signal as it suggests that they are not convinced there'll be inflation.,True,other,True,True
And that could be related to scepticism about the ability of the central bank to influence inflation even five years ahead which would be quite serious.,True,other,True,True
Indeed after our communication at the last Governing Council meeting in Malta you have seen that inflation expectations fiveyearsfiveyears have recovered which is not the case for oil prices.,True,disease,True,True
What surprised us more on the negative side was the slow transmission of easier financial conditions on current and future inflation.,True,machine,True,True
The staff has also been tasked to look at the impact of all measures on financial conditions on the economy and on inflation.,True,other,True,True
It is key for a central bank to keep inflation expectations anchored especially in a period of slack in the economy.,True,orientation,True,True
And we have some signals that these inflation expectations are still fragile.,True,disease,True,True
Longterm inflation expectations remain fragile.,True,disease,True,True
A possible deanchoring of inflation expectations together with a lot of slack is a dangerous cocktail.,True,disease,True,True
However analysts shouldn't focus so much on shortterm data or on certain inflation expectations indices.,False,,True,False
We also look at underlying inflation and factors which accelerate inflationary pressures such as phenomena that have an impact on the capacity for pricesetting etc.,True,machine,True,True
The euro areas recovery is on track and gaining momentum but still weak as inflation expectations are not rising and core inflation has levelled out.,True,orientation,True,True
Or rather will they prevent in a lasting way inflation from returning towards 2?,False,,True,False
What we can do what we must do is maintain confidence in inflation returning towards our objective of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB within its mandate cannot accept inflation stabilising in the vicinity of 1.,True,orientation,True,True
Today the risks for growth and inflation are tilted to the downside.,True,orientation,True,True
The best service that the ECB can provide to the citizens of the euro area is to fulfil its mandate so that inflation returns towards 2 which requires the economy to pick up again jobs to be created and exports to the euro area to find solvent outlets.,True,orientation,True,True
The Governing Council saw an increased risk that inflation would stay too low for too long and concluded that additional monetary policy reactions could be warranted should this risk materialise.,True,disease,True,True
The first thing we want to achieve is price stability and that means maintaining trust in our capacity to raise inflation to close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
The risks are therefore certainly on the downside for both inflation and growth also because of the potential slowdown in the United States the causes of which we need to understand fully.,True,orientation,True,True
We expect inflation to remain close to zero and maybe even to turn negative at least until the start of 2016.,True,orientation,True,True
This will lead to a purely mechanical increase in annual inflation.,True,machine,True,True
From mid2016 to the end of 2017 also due to the delayed effect of the depreciation in the exchange rate we expect inflation to increase gradually.,True,orientation,True,True
But what is important to note today is that even in Septembers forecasts we had already lowered our inflation expectations for 2017 compared with those we forecast in March when we had just started purchasing 60 billion of public sector securities a month.,True,orientation,True,True
The good news about mediumterm inflation expectations is that after falling in September these have now returned to a level above 1.7 which is not far from our inflation objective.,True,orientation,True,True
If we are convinced that our mediumterm inflation target is at risk we will take the necessary actions.,True,warfare,True,True
In particular in Amsterdam it was said that a significant worsening of the mediumterm outlook for inflation could warrant the purchase of government securities.,True,orientation,True,True
It should also be taken into account that in the case of monetary union the decisions were even more complex because it was necessary to assess the relative importance of different factors driving the fall in inflation such as the structural readjustments in the countries which were in greater need of restoring their competitiveness the fall in the price of oil and the strong appreciation of the exchange rate in 2013.,True,orientation,True,True
As I said external circumstances the assumptions underlying our forecasts are important because they influence inflation expectations and therefore the profile of the return towards price stability and of the growth rate.,True,orientation,True,True
Low inflation has two effects.,True,other,True,True
The ECBs Governing Council is determined to fulfil this mandate which is to have inflation close to 2 in the medium term.,False,,True,False
After all we had increasing risks of deflation in Europe.,True,disease,True,True
In the current juncture amid the renewed decline in headline inflation we have to be mindful whether there could be secondround effects stemming from the decline in oil prices or if there is an overestimation in the assessment of the Chinese situation.,True,disease,True,True
Well the first thing the ECB has to do is to just do our job which is to bring inflation back towards 2 and to create an environment that makes it possible to invest and to reform.,True,orientation,True,True
Inflation expectations are well on course in the long term so the whole discussion is about how fast they will come back to 2 how fast inflation will come back to 2?,False,,False,False
That 2 inflation target is really the encore for the whole recovery process in the euro area.,True,sports,True,True
Well its not going to change the growth outcome the growth outlook much but if it a rise in the oil price can bring inflation expectations in line with 2 sooner that would certainly be a positive factor for the whole recovery process.,True,orientation,True,True
If we look at any measure of inflation we see that it takes quite an effort to raise inflation expectations and actual inflation to the levels that are consistent with our objective of below but close to 2 in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In March when we started purchasing assets at a pace of EUR 60 billion per month we were forecasting that inflation would be back to 1.8 by 2017.,True,orientation,True,True
Therefore it presently appears that it will take somewhat longer than previously anticipated for inflation to come back to and stabilise around levels that we consider sufficiently close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We fight inflation when prices rise too quickly with the same determination as when prices rise too slowly.,True,warfare,True,True
And with our policy we have certainly been successful in terms of counteracting fears of deflation I should like to think.,True,warfare,True,True
It is already having an effect in terms of inflation expectations for example which have recovered again and in terms of the general financing conditions which have eased somewhat.,True,disease,True,True
If we judged that shocks were sufficiently severe and persistent to weaken the inflation outlook for the euro area we would not hesitate to act.,True,warfare,True,True
In spite of this policy for a long time the inflation rate in Switzerland has been even lower than in the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
We will again have inflation rates below but close to 2 because our policy will achieve its goal.,True,sports,True,True
The ultimate metric to assess success is the inflation rate normalization around our medium term target.,True,machine,True,True
We said in January that we were aiming at achieving a sustained path of inflation towards our objective and we are far from that objective right now.,True,orientation,True,True
If the price of oil does not continue to go down it cannot go down indefinitely we will see a jump in inflation in the last quarter of this year.,True,orientation,True,True
But we may have before that some months of negative inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The staff projections are recent predicated on the completion of the whole programme and foresee inflation at 1.7 by 2017.,True,other,True,False
This will end if the recovery continues and that will help later inflation rates to normalize.,True,machine,True,True
There is more rigidity in wages in a recession in Europe and that is an important factor and that is why I never really feared we would have actual deflation in Europe.,True,disease,True,True
Most of euro area GDP comes from services and inflation in services is basically about wage developments.,True,other,True,True
It is very difficult to go to a situation of deflation in Europe.,True,orientation,True,True
When inflation is weak the best way to bring it up to the 2 objective is to support economic activity.,True,orientation,True,True
As regards the figure of 2 there is not much point in thinking about this when inflation is at 0.2. We should concentrate first of all on bringing inflation back towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Price stability does not mean 0 inflation.,True,other,True,True
When inflation is measured at 0 the actual rate of inflation is less than 0 as there is a tendency to overestimate the rate of inflation by underestimating the underlying adjustments in the quality of goods and services.,True,other,True,True
And just think if we reduce our inflation objective when inflation stands at 0.2 how are we to prevent it from being raised the next time it stands at 3.5? Our inflation objective has served us well and the mediumterm orientation gives us sufficient flexibility.,True,orientation,True,True
The first months have been encouraging contrary to what some were saying we have had no difficulty finding assets to buy indicators of the inflation expectations are showing signs of recovery lending to nonfinancial corporations is trending upwards the recovery trajectory is there to be seen and we expect inflation to move back towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But we are only at the start of these asset purchases which we plan to maintain until September 2016 and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation in line with our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB has pursued its policy of monetary easing rockbottom interest rates and purchases of securities in the markets in order to return to growth and inflation below but close to 2 in the euro area in line with our mandate.,False,,True,True
The reason that rates are at zero and purchases of securities are being carried out is because we want to kickstart the European economy and raise inflation towards 2.,True,machine,True,True
This is a temporary strategy aimed at responding to the very specific situation that we saw in 2014 when inflation rates deviated from our target on a lasting basis and flirted with deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Were we to abandon that policy today we would plunge the euro area into an undesirable situation where both growth and inflation were weak in the long term.,True,orientation,True,True
Some people refer to that as the world of 1 i.e. 1 growth and 1 inflation.,False,,True,False
In 2013 the nature of the debate changed and became more traditional applying to growth and inflation which were too weak in the euro area as a whole.,False,,False,False
On top of that the tumbling oil price raised fears of possible deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We moved from a comfort zone where we thought a cyclical upturn would emerge spontaneously towards a more dangerous zone where inflation rates would be persistently adrift from our definition of price stability i.e. 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Confidence that the ECB will take its mandate to keep inflation below but close to 2 seriously.,True,orientation,True,True
But every decision about QE whether it be starting it or increasing or decreasing its scale or its duration will only be taken in line with the objectives of monetary policy primarily the mediumterm inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
First in the current environment where inflation is too low the objective of growth is equivalent to the objective of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
Its intention is not to affirm the cohesion of the euro area it has a purely monetary intention namely to support activity and ultimately inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Why should we think of discontinuing it when inflation is negative and inflation expectations are nowhere near our mediumterm goal of close to 2?,True,orientation,True,True
But Constâncio disagrees that things are going well enough to already start tapering off quantative easing inflation expectations are too low for that.,True,orientation,True,True
Until inflation comes sustainably close to 2 the ECB will continue to intervene in the financial markets with the attendant risks such as rapid asset price increases and the disadvantage of low returns for pension funds.,True,orientation,True,True
Our policy is aimed at bringing euro area inflation back to levels below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
This forms the basis for our March projections which envisage a slow return to an inflation rate that is close to our understanding of stable prices accordingly we shall be at 1.8 in 2017.,True,orientation,True,True
The Governing Councils decision refers to a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
I also distinguish between an undershooting of zero inflation which is mainly attributable to temporary phenomena such as the price of oil and on which we can effectively have no influence and a general fall in the price level.,True,orientation,True,True
Also inflation expectations slumped from 1.8 to 1.4. These were the arguments that persuaded me to recognise that we had to turn to the final resort.,True,orientation,True,True
When it dropped to 1.4 it was a free fall and there was a risk of a deanchoring of inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
We are aware that it plays an important role in inflation.,True,other,True,True
We quickly and unanimously concluded that we should not have an inflation target of 0.,True,other,True,True
In that scenario we would tend to be deflationoriented not least because of statistical distortions in measuring prices.,True,orientation,True,True
An economy therefore needs a little inflation in order to have a buffer.,True,other,True,True
.which is not yet deflation.,False,,True,False
The current slowdown in the rate of inflation is largely attributable to the fall in energy prices.,True,orientation,True,True
And its also essential that we look at price stability in the medium term and at mediumterm inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
However medium to longterm inflation expectations have clearly fallen that is why the current low key interest rates are definitely justified.,True,orientation,True,True
A prolonged low inflation rate environment carries risks for banks and insurance firms.,True,disease,True,True
Then in November we saw that inflation was remaining weak and in spite of the measures we had taken that inflation expectations had become seriously destabilised.,True,orientation,True,True
We flagged the risk of being trapped in a 11 economy 1 inflation 1 growth.,True,other,True,True
This would create a vicious circle if everybody revised their inflation and growth expectations downwards then there would be less investment and a debt overhang.,True,orientation,True,True
We have always said that low oil prices have an ambiguous effect positive because energy is cheaper but negative if they reinforce the deflationary behaviour of economic agents.,True,disease,True,True
We believed that doing it at that moment would put us back onto a growth trajectory reducing the risk of the deanchoring of inflationary expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
The pickup in headline inflation is largely due to a base effect namely the fact that the impact on annual inflation of the drop in the price of fuel and other goods influenced by the price of oil will disappear later this year.,True,other,True,True
The gradual increase in the price of oil that markets expect to see over the projection horizon and which forms part of our assumptions will also give support to our headline inflation projections.,True,orientation,True,True
The more relevant question is on core inflation when you take the price of food and energy out this is now at 0.7. It gets close to 2 in 2017 converging with headline inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The first element in the increase of core inflation is the passthrough of the exchange rate which is the most important impact.,True,other,True,True
But the key assumption giving support to the projected inflation is not a vigorous pickup in wage costs which in fact are going to remain moderate but rather firms regaining pricing power.,True,warfare,True,True
As I said there was uneasiness about the serious risks of deanchoring in inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
In 2003 the ECB announced that in order to avoid risks of deflation inflation should be below but close enough to 2 in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In January we concluded that we were confronted with the risk of falling into deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The price of protection against deflation jumped.,True,other,True,True
When we designed the policy we wanted to have a sustained path of inflation towards where it should be.,True,orientation,True,True
The people who said we may be in a deflationary spiral may be the same people who now say its too much.,True,orientation,True,True
We are coming from a situation in which the risk of financial instability came from inflation being permanently too low possibly a deflation risk.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECBs sole mandate is to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole which we define as consumer price inflation being below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The Governing Council saw there was a risk of inflation being too low for too long and decided to act under its mandate.,True,orientation,True,True
Recently we have also seen some positive effects from the credit easing measures we took over the summer but given the persistence of too low inflation for a prolonged period of time the Governing Council decided to take additional measures.,True,disease,True,True
The question is not so much to reach a precise figure of inflation at the end of September 2016 it is rather to influence mediumterm inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
We have had an extended period over which inflation has been below levels where the Governing Council wants to see it in the medium term that is below but not too far from 2 and that is why we decided to act further.,True,orientation,True,True
We have not seen deflation despite having negative inflation but we did see a higher risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,True
In addition you have to consider the oil supply shock which is positive for growth provided that inflation expectations remain anchored.,True,orientation,True,True
When inflation expectations are threatened by a shock you may get negative impacts owing to possible delaying of consumption or investment.,True,warfare,True,True
The biggest risk now is that after years of lower inflation expectations and lower real growth there is a risk of an entrenched pessimism that might become selffulfilling delaying expenditure and investment which in turn leads to underemployment and lower potential growth.,True,disease,True,True
The question is always the interest rate you pay versus the nominal growth rate that includes the effect of inflation which is also important.,True,other,True,True
It is true that there is a heightened risk of too prolonged a period of low inflation.,True,disease,True,True
We have deferred the point in time when we expect a return to inflation of below but close to 2 in the medium term which is our monetary policy objective.,True,orientation,True,True
And neither has the deflationary scenario materialised.,True,other,True,True
On the contrary it was imperative to act to prevent inflation expectations from becoming unanchored.,True,orientation,True,True
By launching QE now we aim to anchor inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
Right now that means avoiding inflation staying too low for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
On average prices in the euro area fell by 0.6 in January and inflation rates will remain negative in the coming months.,True,orientation,True,True
If inflation in the euro area were to rise to 4 everybody would expect the ECB to do something about it.,True,orientation,True,True
Consequently the ECB also has to step in when inflation falls to nearly zero.,True,orientation,True,True
For very good reasons the Governing Council of the ECB defined price stability many years ago as inflation close to but below 2 over the medium term and it did so with the support of Germany and the Bundesbank.,True,orientation,True,True
With an inflation target of 0 there would be no buffer.,True,other,True,True
If an economic shock occurs in such cases you have deflation straight away.,True,disease,True,True
We are not expecting deflation but there are risks that need to be addressed.,True,disease,True,True
That is why we had to take action before the damage is done because the inflation expectations of consumers and businesses are falling.,True,orientation,True,True
Also a period of low inflation that is too prolonged entails significant risks.,True,disease,True,True
And there was a risk of that occurring in the euro area because deflation means less growth and lower income.,True,disease,True,True
Some members of the Governing Council are of the opinion that such a measure should only be taken when deflation is a given.,True,disease,True,True
Nonetheless almost all experts believe that it is far more difficult to combat deflation when in the midst of such developments.,True,warfare,True,True
In that case the central bank would have to spend many times as much and would still not be sure that deflation will be overcome successfully.,True,warfare,True,True
We will make purchases from early March until at least September 2016 i.e. 19 months and shall continue until there is a sustained improvement in mediumterm inflation.,True,plant,True,True
When it will end is therefore not an urgent issue it will be assessed based on a range of indicators including inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
It will end only once we get a strong sense that inflation is converging towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The euro area is not in deflation.,False,,True,False
But there is a risk which got worse last summer that growth and inflation remain weak in the long term and that we fall into a 1 economy growth at 1 and inflation at 1.,True,disease,True,True
Since summer 2014 economic growth has got off to a weaker and slower thanexpected start and inflation is far below the 2 of our mandate.,True,orientation,True,True
We will take into account the American and British experiences in order to decide on the amount of securities to buy in order to restore confidence in inflation returning to a level close to but below 2 while bearing in mind the economic and institutional specificities of the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
The goal of QE is to provide confidence in the central banks ability to stabilise inflation.,True,machine,True,True
.The starting point is not deflation but inflation being low far away from our definition of price stability which is below but close to 2 in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
So the discussion is on the risk of inflation being too low for too long and on the available instruments if we have to do more.,True,orientation,True,True
Deflation would be a compounding factor I would say because if the euro zone were to fall into deflation which is not the case today but it certainly is a risk it is a limited risk but it is a risk.,True,orientation,True,True
We dont need to be in deflation to worry about low inflation low inflation is bad enough.,True,orientation,True,True
An important part of that discussion relates to the impact of the low oil price and whether this is a temporary or permanent shock to inflation.,True,disease,True,True
It may be different because we are starting from a different place which is extremely low inflation extremely low headline inflation and also decreasing inflation expectations in the mediumterm and we see a stronger link between medium term expectations and short term inflation numbersoutcomes.,True,orientation,True,True
So anything that happens to headline inflation rates has potential to feed into long term inflation expectations and thats what we have to be wary of where we want to be careful.,True,liquids,True,True
They have to make the case in a convincing way to the European people that they use all available instruments to move the European economy out of the situation its in today before it becomes a trap for the economy which is low growth and low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
So we have to make the case in a convincing way that we have the resolve and the instrument to move the European economy out of the low growth low inflation situation before it becomes a trap.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB has a mandate which has to do with inflation.,True,other,True,True
There was terrorism an inflation rate that reached 20 .,False,,True,False
That is precisely the point in Germany some people say of me ah that Italian he is sure to fuel inflation in the German economy! And I explain to them that their experience of inflation dates back to the 1920s while mine is far more recent.,True,fire,True,True
And second because expected inflation and the longterm growth forecast for the economy are both unfortunately very low.,False,,True,False
As our policy brings back inflation to close to 2 and growth picks up more normal levels of interest rates will return.,False,,True,False
The European Central Banks mandate is to achieve an inflation rate of just below 2 for the euro area as a whole.,False,,True,False
The answer is no! Because we would then create deflation and recession.,False,,True,False
But this reasoning is wrong! If inflation were to rise we would have to raise rates again.,False,,True,False
Yes what I described is a negative deflationary spiral.,True,orientation,True,True
The only thing that counters this is the credibility of our inflation objective the attainment of which requires the continuation of our expansionary monetary policy.,True,warfare,True,True
You see the falling oil prices are a good thing but to the extent that they have a negative impact on peoples inflation expectations not a good thing at all.,False,,False,False
The danger is that people may start believing that we will not go back to an inflation rate of 2 very soon not even in five years and this by itself would have a recessionary effect.,True,orientation,True,True
Shall I show you what the expectations curve for the inflation rate looks like?,False,,True,False
Look at this he holds out a piece of paper The average annual inflation rate expected during the course of the following year used to stand at around 1.77 in the past in 2013 it stood at 1.08 and now it is only 0.37.,False,,False,False
In the past the average inflation expected for the next five years was 2.31 and today it stands at 1.68.,False,,False,False
Thats how it goes! It means that the risk of deflation is still low but it is definitely higher that it was a year ago.,True,orientation,True,True
But from a central bankers perspective inflation is easier to tackle than deflation.,True,warfare,True,True
When there is inflation you raise the interest rates.,True,orientation,True,True
With deflation it is harder.,True,orientation,True,True
I would speak of deflation when both prices and output are falling and the problem is getting worse and worse because people dont invest or consume when they are waiting for prices to fall further.,True,disease,True,True
However inflation rates throughout Europe are extremely low and far removed from 2 from what central bankers define as price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
Second inflation was too low even beforehand and inflation expectations are moving further and further away from 2 which we aim in our monetary policy to achieve over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In the current environment the continuous decline in oil prices increases the danger that people will lose confidence in our inflation target.,True,disease,True,True
If one aims at 0 half the time inflation will be positive and half the time it will be negative.,True,sports,True,True
And when inflation is negative and interest rates have fallen to zero one cannot lower interest rates to bring inflation back to zero.,True,orientation,True,True
Mr Cœuré the euro area economy is currently growing above its potential and inflation according to ECB President Mario Draghi should reach the objective of nearly 2 between 2018 and 2019.,False,,False,False
Things are clearly moving in the right direction in the euro area the recovery is on track growth is higher and inflation is picking up.,True,orientation,True,True
At the same time however the inflation rate remains well below 2 and core inflation.,False,,True,False
There are signs of an acceleration in headline inflation above all because of the increase in oil and commodity prices.,True,machine,True,True
However we are still waiting for signs that core inflation is on the rise and will clearly exceed 1.,True,orientation,True,True
That said our assessment of the balance of risks including for inflation is shifting.,True,orientation,True,True
For two reasons on the one hand inflation is still very low.,False,,True,False
A further reduction can only be considered at a later stage depending on how inflation adjusts towards 2.,False,,False,False
But do you think upside risks to inflation are increasing?,False,,True,False
Developments since the latest projections by ECB economists i.e. the weaker euro and higher oil prices are pointing to slightly higher inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Speaking personally I dont exclude upside risks to inflation in 2017 if the reflationary impact of the new US policies dominates.,True,orientation,True,True
In the United States for example the economic recovery is far more advanced than in the euro area unemployment is lower and the rate of inflation is higher.,False,,True,False
However the speed is still moderate and inflation is still some distance from a sustainable path back to the target value.,True,orientation,True,True
It would have to be apparent that there was a sustained convergence in the rate of inflation towards our objective of below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
As long as the overall money supply is not growing very quickly that is not a cause for concern and does not lead to excessive inflationary pressures.,True,disease,True,True
The fact that we can reduce the quantity of purchases also shows our confidence in growth and in the ability of inflation to return towards 2 which is what we are aiming for.,True,orientation,True,True
Well without it if the ECB wasnt doing what its doing growth would be between 0 and 1 inflation would be close to zero and unemployment wouldnt be falling in the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
We are growing and inflation is improving.,True,plant,True,True
Right now our latest introductory statement says that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation which is necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
And I would say in spite of the many crises of the last six seven years we continue to steer the ship towards this mandate and we foresee that inflation will go back towards our objective of an inflation rate below but close to 2 by 20182019.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECBs monetary policy will remain very accommodative until inflation is firmly on a path towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Without our exceptional measures growth would be weaker the unemployment rate higher and inflation would be zero or even negative.,True,orientation,True,True
A highly accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate and will continue to be appropriate until inflation is firmly back on track and heading towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Our mandate is to ensure price stability in the medium term and that means a mediumterm inflation rate of below but close to 2.,False,,True,False
The ground has therefore been prepared for greater and stronger growth for more jobs and thus ultimately for higher inflation too.,True,plant,True,True
The latest information that we have received shows that in terms of growth and inflation we are heading in the direction that we had projected.,True,orientation,True,True
However an economys potential for growth and thus its level of inflation hinge not only on its central banks capacity to act but also on its governments fiscal and structural policy and it is clear that more needs to be done in this regard.,True,machine,True,True
We do not need to respond to any and every deviation from the inflation objective instead we should among other things examine the reasons behind it and assess whether it is a longterm trend.,True,orientation,True,True
Questioning our inflation objective every time we deviate from it would be the point at which we would quite rightly lose our credibility.,True,orientation,True,True
And when this will happen we will have also higher nominal wages and ultimately a return of inflation towards our objective of being close to but below 2.,True,orientation,True,True
And lets never forgot that the measures we have taken of lower interest rates are always measures that will produce and are producing the objective that we are pursuing namely higher growth and higher inflation.,True,machine,True,True
We will continue to purchase assets on a monthly basis until March 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment of inflation towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Our monetary policy has been extremely accommodative since spring 2014 in response to inflation figures and outlooks that were too weak for too long.,True,disease,True,True
We cant say that because where would inflation be without our policy?,False,,True,False
Our monetary policy objective is to return inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Our monthly asset purchases to the tune of 80 billion should continue until the end of March 2017 or beyond if necessary and in any case until we see a sustainable adjustment in inflation in line with our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
Similarly returns on savings once adjusted for inflation are near their historical average.,True,other,True,True
Inflation according to our calculations for what they are worth using models developed by ECB economists would be half a point weaker i.e. it would be negative with all the risks of a deflationary spiral that that entails.,True,disease,True,False
Our monetary policy has been very much on the alert in order to avoid a deanchoring of inflation expectations towards a lower level.,True,orientation,True,True
And sometimes it is difficult for the public to understand why we act so strongly trying to avoid a deanchoring of inflation expectations to below 1 or close to zero.,True,orientation,True,True
The reason is that when you go from an inflation rate of 2 to 0 in a context where you have a lot of output gap firms with excess capacity will try to underprice their competitors and they can do so by reducing their prices which means that inflation will fall below zero on aggregate.,True,orientation,True,True
You go quickly into a deflationary risk scenario.,True,orientation,True,True
So very low inflation in the presence of economic slack is a dangerous cocktail.,True,liquids,True,True
But this being said we havent concluded that inflation expectations are deanchored.,True,orientation,True,True
But in 2014 the recovery was showing renewed signs of weakening with an acceleration in the pace of disinflation which was threatening the stability of inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
With hindsight you can always say that we could have done it differently but I think that what the ECB has demonstrated with its action is that we are absolutely determined to avoid deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
All the actions we took to avoid a banking crisis and in the end the breakup of the euro were instrumental in avoiding deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We didnt really see high inflationary pressures in the boom years so when the bust of the financial cycle came after a short spike due to higher oil prices inflation started to fall very sharply.,True,orientation,True,True
After a renewed surge in commodity prices in 2010 and 2011 the reversal of those shocks set in motion a prolonged period of disinflation.,True,machine,True,True
When we realised that this process was starting to contaminate the domestic components of inflation including inflation expectations we acted very forcefully.,True,disease,True,True
We havent succeeded yet in getting close to 2 but on the other hand we really have avoided deflationary conditions.,True,orientation,True,True
The dominant fact is that we are unanimous in our intention to reach our inflation objective and support the economy.,True,orientation,True,True
The Group of Seven G7 countries are faced with a common challenge how can they escape from this low growth low inflation environment?,True,other,True,True
In order to prevent euro area inflation from being too low for too long the ECB has brought shortterm interest rates to levels close to zero or negative and is providing forward guidance on the future monetary policy stance.,True,orientation,True,True
In 2003 the ECBs Governing Council clarified that euro area inflation should be below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Several times in the past the ECB faced the risk of inflation remaining high for too long in an environment of expansionary economic policies.,True,disease,True,True
At present inflation in the euro area is around 0 and is expected to remain low for a considerable period of time.,False,,False,False
We are confident that our measures will bring inflation back on a sustainable path consistent with our objective of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
However there are compelling reasons to suggest that inflation in the euro area will go up only gradually.,True,orientation,True,True
More recently global developments which are having a negative impact on inflation have added to this.,True,disease,True,True
But even under a very flexible interpretation of our mediumterm inflation objective I am convinced that not acting would have meant failing in our mandate.,False,,False,False
Without our measures current inflation would be much lower and the inflation outlook would be much worse.,True,orientation,True,True
Silently giving up on the commonly agreed inflation objective which has served the ECB well for the last 13 years is not an option.,True,warfare,True,True
Deanchoring inflation expectations would be a source of instability in its own right.,True,orientation,True,True
But deploying negative rates again in the future would require a distinct worsening of the inflation outlook.,True,disease,True,True
Central bank independence and low and steady inflation are written into the German founding law.,True,other,True,True
Assessing the impact on inflation will take some time we have just started to update our projections taking into account the evolution of the economy since March and the new measures.,True,plant,True,True
The climate around the global economy has improved compared to February and March although there are still many uncertainties including of a geopolitical nature which could have implications for growth and inflation moving forward.,True,other,True,True
BILD Mr Draghi when you became President of the European Central Bank ECB just over four years ago the Germans were scared that as an Italian you would create too much inflation.,False,,False,False
Now even an Italian is unable to generate sufficient inflation.,True,machine,True,True
People in Germany can rest assured that their ECB President is doing everything to restore inflation to the right level.,True,machine,True,True
Our mandate is price stability which means inflation of just below 2.,False,,True,False
But interest rates are low because growth is low and inflation is too low.,False,,True,False
Think about the alternative if we raised rates now it would be bad for the economy and it would unleash deflation unemployment and recession.,True,animal,True,True
The interest on savings comes from growth so it is in the interests of savers that inflation stabilises and growth becomes more robust.,True,plant,True,True
Making provision for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult Draghi Remember what counts is what you earn on savings in real terms i.e. interest minus inflation.,True,other,True,False
At that time you might have had a higher interest rate on yourSparbuchsavings account but we often had an inflation rate that was higher still.,False,,False,False
Draghi Its quite simple when the economy is growing more strongly again and inflation rises closer to our objective.,True,plant,True,True
We are in a unique situation in terms of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We have a combination of strong disinflationary forces which are the legacy of the crisis namely high public and private debt nonperforming exposures of banks high unemployment and in general vast unutilised capacity in the economy and a series of negative external shocks especially lower commodity prices all of which explain why inflation is very low and increasing only gradually.,True,warfare,True,True
Our job is to bring inflation back to its near2 level.,True,orientation,True,True
A stronger euro area with inflation of below but close to 2 would be good for Germany.,True,orientation,True,True
As for the debate we may have from time to time with some academics in Germany I would say there is a certain irony in them taking us to task because we are focusing on our inflation target since it is at Germanys insistence that the ECB was given that mandate and that mandate only in the euros founding treaties and in my view rightly so.,True,other,True,True
But it is still very fragile and external shocks can easily trigger a vicious circle with further downward pressure on inflation.,True,disease,True,True
If new negative shocks should worsen the outlook or if financing conditions should not adjust in the direction and to the extent that is necessary to boost the economy and inflation a rate reduction remains in our armoury.,True,warfare,True,True
But don't forget the measures we take like the APP are supposed to remain in place as long as inflation has not reached a sustainable adjustment in the path of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The structural reforms economists often have in mind i.e. liberalization and deregulation of markets lead to lower wages and prices in the shortterm which does not help inflation normalisation.,True,disease,True,True
The second criticism of monetary policy is mostly based on a crude comparison between where inflation or growth is now and where it was at the beginning of the policy.,True,other,True,True
The conclusion inflation didnt change much so the policy isnt working.,True,machine,True,True
Using several models ECB staff estimated that without our policies inflation would have been a third of a percent negative in 2015 and would have stayed significantly negative throughout 2016 which would mean that we would have been in permanent deflation since last year.,True,orientation,True,True
Despite negative rates throughout last year the net interest income NII of euro area banks increased in percentage of assets and their return on equity went up from 3.5 in 2014 to 5.7 in 2015 which corresponds to a real return as inflation was zero.,True,other,True,False
To normalise inflation in the euro area we urgently need higher growth that can reduce negative output and unemployment gaps using all really available policies.,True,disease,True,True
For example our research shows that in the euro area too low inflation results in redistribution from younger more indebted households to older households that are typically net creditors.,True,other,True,True
Rates will have to stay low until we see that the inflation rate in the euro area is moving towards our objective of just below 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But we still have a pressing need for the low rates so as to get inflation firmly back to 2 and to protect the euro area recovery.,True,orientation,True,True
Our next staff inflation projections are due in March.,True,other,True,True
Already in January we said that inflation will only very slowly move back towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
If that continues for too long it can also increase the risk of a rise in inflation being delayed.,True,orientation,True,True
We have to get inflation to below but close to 2 again that has been our definition of price stability for a long time.,True,orientation,True,True
The whole issue is how you see it on the time axis is it a temporary exogenous phenomenon where you can look through it or are you to be worried that over a longer period you have secondround effects and a disanchoring of inflationary expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
Let me first put things straight I do not consider that we have an inflation target.,True,orientation,True,True
Then we see this is happening in an environment of abnormally low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We will be seen in the category of flexible inflation targeters but not inflation targeters where we have a point landing promised on Day X.,True,orientation,True,False
They have been effective but in a specific circumstance of a very prolonged recessionary and deflationary environment.,True,orientation,True,True
The programme is clearly having a positive effect on economic growth and inflation.,False,,True,False
There is also debate as to how long it will take for them to have an impact on inflation.,False,,True,True
After all the low interest rates reflect economic fundamentals such as demographic factors and productivity and cannot be solely attributed to the policy of the central bank which mainly needs to make sure that inflation expectations are well anchored.,True,orientation,True,True
And inflation expectations are still markedly disappointing.,True,other,True,True
It depends among other things on the nature and frequency of economic shocks and how they pass through and influence inflation expectations.,True,disease,True,True
If inflation expectations come under too much pressure you have to intervene.,True,machine,True,True
Many people say isnt low inflation a good thing?,False,,True,False
You also often hear that low inflation is caused by the low oil prices.,True,other,True,True
So the current low rate of inflation is also a reflection of some economic weakness.,True,other,True,True
In 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB defined price stability as a mediumterm inflation rate of below 2.,True,other,True,True
In 2003 it provided additional clarification that it was striving for an inflation rate of below but close to 2 .,True,other,True,True
Since mid2013 inflation has been below 1 and after months of negative rates of inflation it stood at 0.2 in December.,True,orientation,True,True
Critics who see the ECBs efforts to raise the current inflation rate as a change in its monetary policy strategy are mistaken.,True,orientation,True,True
On the contrary abandoning the inflation objective of close to 2 in the medium term would mark a change in its monetary policy strategy.,True,orientation,True,True
Since February 2013 inflation in the euro area has moved away from the ECBs mediumterm objective.,True,orientation,True,True
The persistently low inflation has also affected medium and longterm inflation expectations which are significantly below the levels of previous years.,True,orientation,True,True
Low inflation in the longer term provides only a small buffer against sustained deflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Added to this is the fact that the real value of nominal debt increases when there is deflation.,True,other,True,True
Not least deflation can limit the effectiveness of monetary policy as the central bank can lose control over real interest rates.,True,warfare,True,True
Playing down the risk of deflation would be negligent especially in times of persistently low inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Although falling oil prices have recently played a significant role in low inflation the effect on inflation is not negligible or temporary.,True,orientation,True,True
They also foster secondround effects on inflation e.g. through lower wage settlements.,True,plant,True,True
In particular the APP has helped to counter the fall in inflation expectations as well as reduce the risk of deflation.,True,warfare,True,True
More stable inflation expectations are a necessary condition for a return to mediumterm price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
That of course changes nothing in respect of the monetary policy nature of the measures in the current situation of persistently too low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
You may label that ECB policy a success if inflation the rise in the cost of living stays below but close to 2 over the medium term.,False,,False,False
I admit that our policy has not yet been successful enough inflation rates in Europe have been at the very low level of almost 0 for quite some time now.,False,,False,False
That is why we are continuing to take the necessary measures to drive inflation up to 2 over the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
However the point at which we think we will reach 2 is constantly postponed because all kinds of things are happening that are dampening inflation such as the decline in oil prices or lower economic performances in the emerging countries.,True,liquids,True,True
To put it simply the rate of inflation needs to move sustainably towards 2.,False,,True,True
The ECB stands ready to take all measures that are necessary to bring inflation to 2.,True,machine,True,True
If you print enough money you will always get inflation.,True,machine,True,True
But if oil and commodities prices tumble it is more difficult to allow inflation to rise.,True,orientation,True,True
If a whole series of such factors occur you cant do anything other than somewhat postpone the date on which you seek to reach the higher rate of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
It has a single objective which is to bring euro area inflation back to a level below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Because inflation is still not at 2 we will maintain an ample degree of monetary accommodation.,False,,True,False
The strength of the recovery gives us increasing confidence that inflation will return towards 2 in a sustainable manner.,True,orientation,True,True
We decided in October to reduce our monthly net asset purchases from 60 billion to 30 billion from January until at least September 2018 and longer if needed.By halving the monthly asset purchases we are recognising both the strength of the recovery and our greater confidence in the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
Technological change certainly is a common explanation for low inflation in all advanced economies.,False,,True,False
Low productivity gains are also one explanation for the sustained weakness in wages across advanced economies which in turn also have an impact on inflation.,True,disease,True,True
That helps explain why inflation will only slowly move back towards 2 and why we still need ample monetary accommodation.,True,orientation,True,True
But we have to keep in mind that the ultimate yardstick for our action is inflation.,True,other,True,True
Given the strength of the expansion we are increasingly confident that inflation will rise towards 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
But the Governing Council of the ECB has also made it clear that the programme can be kept in place for longer should inflation disappoint on the downside.,True,orientation,True,True
And if inflation turned out to be higher than currently expected we would have plenty of instruments with which to react.,True,warfare,True,True
But it is indeed surprising that longterm interest rates are now lower than they were in the summer although growth has surprised very positively and growth and inflation forecasts have been adjusted upwards.,True,orientation,True,True
But as ECB President Mario Draghi recently said we are now more confident that inflation is on a sustainable path towards our mediumterm objective of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Indeed in the short term the risks to growth and inflation are more on the upside meaning that both could turn out to be higher than currently forecast.,True,orientation,True,True
To a certain extent this has already been done with the statement about our greater confidence in the path of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
But many of the factors that keep inflation below target are also temporary.,True,orientation,True,True
In a region as varied as the euro area we were well advised not to impose on ourselves a strict inflation targeting regime but to be more flexible.,True,warfare,True,True
But inflation remains weak.,True,disease,True,True
Also in Germany inflationary pressures are surprisingly subdued.,True,disease,True,True
There is very broad agreement in the Governing Council that monetary policy needs to remain accommodative until inflation moves back towards 2 in a sustainable way.,True,orientation,True,True
If you look at longerterm inflation expectations they have been very stable and this has helped avoid deflation.,True,disease,True,True
The ECBs monetary policy will remain very accommodative in particular our asset purchases will continue until inflation clearly moves towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The financial crisis has created deflationary risks.,True,disease,True,True
Our monetary policy measures have played a key role in the economic recovery which is necessary for inflation to gradually return to levels in line with our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
The economic expansion that is under way is not yet feeding through into higher inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
While the ongoing economic expansion provides confidence that inflation will gradually head to levels in line with our inflation aim it has yet to translate sufficiently into stronger inflation dynamics.,True,orientation,True,True
But may I remind you that at the time there was a risk of deflation?,False,,True,False
A deflation scenario would have meant that prices would fall over a long period and people would have started postponing their spending so that the whole economy would have ended up in a negative spiral.,True,orientation,True,True
That risk of deflation is now totally gone.,True,orientation,True,True
The risk of deflation has gone.,True,orientation,True,True
But the current economic expansion has yet to translate sufficiently into stronger inflation dynamics.,True,orientation,True,True
And the ECB defined 'price stability'in 2003 as 'close to two percent inflation in the medium term'.,True,other,True,True
If everyone is confident that our objective is just under two percent inflation then this is included in contracts and especially in wage negotiations for example.,True,other,True,False
Already now we are seeing some wage negotiations taking place based on the lower inflation rate and not on our almost two percent.,True,other,True,True
This shows that 'inflation expectations' are still fragile.,True,machine,True,True
Imagine if we defined price stability as zero percent inflation in the euro area.,True,other,True,True
But anyone who thinks we should be happy with zero percent inflation because we will otherwise destabilise the financial system is underestimating the importance of aiming for close to two percent inflation.,True,other,True,True
This means that as soon as inflation threatens to increase above our objective we will intervene just as forcefully in order to prevent that happening too.,True,warfare,True,True
Thanks to the very strong economic growth we are more and more confident that inflation will increase towards our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
But underlying inflation remains too low.,True,orientation,True,True
If inflation becomes too high we will react just as ruthlessly as we are now in order to get inflation back on track.,True,warfare,True,True
Apart from that one has to measure return in real terms in other words corrected for inflation.,True,other,True,True
So when there is a sustainable return to an inflation below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
First central banks worldwide implemented various unconventional measures during the past decade which were effective in meeting the challenges of low inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
The resulting low inflation and growth in the euro area the UK and the US would go handinhand with subpar labour income growth.,True,orientation,True,True
The first approach starts by estimating the countercyclicality of real shortterm interest rates for the euro area the areawide nominal rate divided by national inflation rates in response to output gaps at the level of 14 advanced economies 9 euro area countries 3 other EU countries and Australia and Canada.,True,other,True,True
Whats crucial in that context is a stable trend in the rate of inflation towards our objective of just under 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But and this has to do with our mandate the underlying inflationary pressure remains subdued.,True,other,True,True
Some people said that this policy would create hyperinflation whereas others thought that at best it would have no effect.,True,other,True,True
The thing is deflationary pressures were considerable in 2015.,True,other,True,True
Now indeed inflation is picking up but that is a process that is a long way from completion.,True,plant,True,True
From an inflation perspective we cannot be satisfied yet.,True,other,True,True
We need to be patient because inflation convergence needs more time to show through convincingly in the data.,True,other,True,True
And we need to be persistent because our baseline for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which to a large extent depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.,True,other,True,True
But if we increase interest rates and tighten policy too quickly we could jeopardise the recovery and end up further away than ever from our inflation target.,True,warfare,True,True
This will reinforce accommodation and make sure that inflation sustainably converges towards our objective of below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,other,True,True
Wage increases are partly based on current inflation rates and they are relatively low at the moment.,True,other,True,True
We have many internal discussions about that about whether something in the inflation process has broken down.,False,,False,False
Wage inflation is on the way but we need to be patient about these things.,True,orientation,True,True
Some of those central and eastern European countries such as Poland Hungary and the Czech Republic are now experiencing stronger wage inflation.,True,other,True,True
Another factor influencing wage inflation is that more people are working as selfemployed.,True,other,True,True
This adjustment has been done in a very careful way as a number of factors continue to weigh on inflation.,True,other,True,True
But when this is needed it should do so carefully and flexibly and based on what matters for us within the framework of our mandate the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
We base our decisions on facts but make no mistake without monetary support inflation today would not be approaching 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The underlying inflationary pressures are still weak.,True,other,True,True
Constâncio Beyond the point that these are important subjects for any economy looking ahead it's also important for monetary policy because this concept of output gap dimension which is the difference between where output is at the moment compared with the potential output as it could be this is a very important concept for monetary policy decisions because what we want when we want to say bring inflation closer to 2 is for aggregate demand to put pressure on supply in order for prices to go up.,True,warfare,True,True
What we can say now is that what we observe is that domestic factors of inflation starting with wage costs and then also price decisions are not responding the way we would expect in view of what are the more common estimates of this slack.,True,other,True,True
If we want to bring inflation to our target of below but close to 2 then we have to persist in the type of monetary policy that we have been adopting.,True,warfare,True,True
He recalled that domestic drivers of inflation measured by the underlying inflation are still subdued and that we need to be sure that when we get to inflation close to 2 it's a durable situation and a selfsustained situation that can go on without the high degree of accommodation that we have now so all these conditions he reaffirmed them and then talked precisely about the need to persist and about the need to be prudent in talking about premature withdrawal of stimulus.,True,warfare,True,True
That prevented a meltdown of the financial system which otherwise would have led to strongly deflationary pressure across the euro area.,True,fire,True,True
When the day comes we will look at inflation and act accordingly regardless of whether governments complain.,True,other,True,True
Real GDP per capita taking inflation into account has stagnated over that period.,True,other,True,True
Basically the thrust of what the Governing Council decided last week is to acknowledge the improving economic circumstances to translate it into a revised forward guidance because we have to adapt to economic reality but also to give a sense of patience when it comes to rates being low we are still not seeing inflation where we would like it to be we're still not seeing the criteria that we've set for inflation to be sustainable all being met.,True,orientation,True,True
Now we have an inflation mandate so when it comes to the next steps well have to focus on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We discussed a lot the economic situation we discussed the prospects for inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
There was a sense of progress also when it comes to inflation where in spite of the inflation being revised downwards if you look carefully at the staff forecast youll see that inflation is also less dependent on our monetary policy measures which is one step in the right direction but its not yet quite enough to start discussing tapering.,True,orientation,True,True
So well discuss tapering whenever we see the economic situation and the prospects for inflation are right for discussing it.,True,orientation,True,True
No again that will depend a lot on the economic numbers it will depend a lot on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And as I said the discussion last week was very much about taking stock of the progress in the economy taking stock of the progress that will support an improved path for inflation and thats a discussion that well have again and again.,True,orientation,True,True
A lot of them are on temporary contracts a lot of them are parttime and this produces less inflationary pressures.,True,machine,True,True
It all depends on how confident we'll be that price pressures will be building up to a point where inflation will be sustainably converging towards two percent which is our definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
But we cannot be sure at which pace and it's fair to say that today given the information that we have we cannot yet be sure that the upturn in inflation is sustainable and selfsustained that it will be there without our monetary policy support.,True,orientation,True,True
Just to give you an example that includes that our monetary policy support is conditional on inflation being on a sustainable path towards 2 percent.,True,orientation,True,True
I don't want to anticipate discussions that we'll have in the Governing Council but it's clear that the deflation risk is now off the table and that is also being acknowledged by financial markets by money market rates and even at the longer end of the curve.,True,orientation,True,True
Term premium has increased substantially since September and part of it is related to the deflation risk being now clearly off the table from the market's standpoint.,True,orientation,True,True
So we will always do whatever is needed to bring euro area inflation back to close to 2 percent no less but no more.,True,orientation,True,True
When you look at measures of core inflation there has been an increase in April but the jury is still out as to how much of it is related to seasonal effects and particularly to Easter and so it's too early to conclude that there would be a sizeable upward adjustment in core inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The third criterion was that we want to be reassured that the upward path in inflation can be maintained even in conditions in which monetary policy becomes less accommodative.,True,orientation,True,True
The future path of inflation remains dependent on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.,True,orientation,True,True
The first crierion is that the path of inflation is expected to reach levels below but close to 2 percent within the medium term horizon.,True,orientation,True,True
The fourth criterion is about euro area inflation and not the inflation of any individual country which goes without saying.,True,other,True,True
In the past we have sometimes overestimated wage inflation as we failed to properly factor in people who gave up on the job market or those forced to accept parttime rather than fulltime jobs.,True,other,True,True
Over the next couple of years the pressure on wages should start to feed into inflation.,True,animal,True,True
We're not trapped in a low inflation environment.,True,orientation,True,True
We first need assurance that inflation is on a sustainable path.,True,orientation,True,True
Since the crisis we have had serious concerns about deflationary risks on several occasions in the euro area but now we can say that they have disappeared.,True,disease,True,True
Its headline inflation that has picked up and this is significantly affected by volatile elements such as oil and food prices.,True,orientation,True,True
Underlying inflation which is an indicator of price stability over the medium term remains subdued.,True,orientation,True,True
We always look through transitory changes in euro area HICP inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
But the important question is whether the adjustment of the path of inflation towards below but close to 2 would continue without our expansionary monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
That gives us confidence but the upward trend and hence the normalisation of inflation are still very dependent on monetary policy stimulus.,True,orientation,True,True
While inflation is temporarily close to the desired target it is based to a large extent on shortterm fluctuations in energy prices.,True,other,True,True
The underlying inflation trend is still noticeably weak and we have to monitor it in order to fulfil our mandate in a sustainable way.,True,disease,True,True
Devaluations give some shortlived breathing space which is washed out by inflation and higher risk premia.,True,liquids,True,False
Our policies have stabilized the Eurozone we are seeing results and the deflation risk is gone.,True,disease,True,True
We look at a number of indicators of underlying inflation of which core inflation is one.,True,other,True,True
At the moment we do not see a pickup in underlying inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Our policies are working and the inflation path is still conditional on our accommodative monetary policy stance.,True,orientation,True,True
Returning your question can we say that inflation has come back having had such an inflation rate for one month?,True,orientation,True,False
In the euro area and the ECB conducts monetary policy for the euro area inflation was 1.1 in December and it is estimated at 1.8 in January.,True,other,False,True
For December the increase in inflation was driven mainly by energy prices specifically by what is known as the base effect.,True,machine,True,True
Please let me finish .therefore it is really important to see a trend that it is certain that inflation really has come back.,True,orientation,True,True
But for me it is crucial that we don't just have a short temporary upward outlier which would then months later give us inflation rates that were too low and we might then have to respond with stronger and even more accommodative monetary policy measures.,True,orientation,True,True
And if you have inflation at 1.8 for a month then of course you wont be 200 down on your 10000 as it cant be calculated for the whole year but only for a month.,True,orientation,True,True
The programme itself comes to an end next year provided that it is not renewed in the event that our optimistic expectations are not met after all and inflation is lower.,True,other,True,True
But to recap if the inflation rate as we saw it in January were to continue then I wouldnt want to wait until next year.,True,other,True,True
And if the inflation rate here is much too low for a long period and inflation expectations if you look at them are very low i.e. below well below 2 that we aim for then we have to react as that is our mandate.,True,orientation,True,True
In January 2002 when the euro banknotes and coins were introduced there were admittedly rounding effects that resulted in higher prices a little bump in inflation.,True,other,True,True
Since then inflation has averaged 1.9 annually in the euro area and 1.7 in France which is much lower than it was before the euro.,True,orientation,True,True
In the 1980s inflation was in double figures editor's note 13.6 in 1980 and 13.4 in 1981.,True,orientation,True,False
The single currency has contained inflation which is a tax on the poor.,True,disease,True,True
The rich can always protect themselves against inflation for example by investing in the stock market.,True,warfare,True,True
The ECB has conducted a very expansionary monetary policy to stimulate inflation and employment a necessary step for the euro area.,True,machine,True,True
So its our job to understand to what extent that increase in the price of raw materials and food will have a lasting impact on inflation.,True,other,True,True
You know we are very pragmatic people we look at the figures and then well see how inflation is being passed on to what we call underlying inflation and also how inflation is being passed on to wages i.e. well see if wage negotiations are taking account of price increases.,True,other,False,True
And in general Germans understand very well that the European Central Bank has an inflation mandate for the euro area.,True,other,True,True
They understand that inflation in the euro area should return towards 2 and I think they also understand that to have a strong economy in the euro area is in the interests of Germany.,True,orientation,True,True
And second we discussed growth and inflation.,False,,True,True
And inflation is creeping up as we know.,True,animal,True,True
We spent most of the meeting discussing sustainability and the conclusion was clearly that we want to know more before we can pass a judgment on inflation higher inflation being sustainable and then adjust our programme.,True,plant,True,True
What people really have to understand have to appreciate and he knows it very well is that our mandate is about eurozone inflation.,False,,False,False
So we follow eurozone inflation.,False,,True,True
It is also helping to push inflation up so everything we are doing is working and if its in the interest of Europe it must be in the interest of Germany obviously.,True,orientation,True,True
That discussion hasnt started yet because inflation is not firm enough is not sustainable enough and that will come but it will come later.,True,plant,True,True
We will keep it stable in the first instance because an expansionary accommodative monetary policy is still needed to stimulate investments including in Germany and to continue to support economic growth in order to achieve inflation rates within our very narrow corridor of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The inflation rates you see in the United States are much more stable exactly where the Federal Reserve wants them.,True,orientation,True,True
You'll also see that the inflation rates are projected to fall again next year.,True,orientation,True,True
It depends on the price inflation data we receive in the first and second quarters of 2019.,True,other,True,False
Again it depends on how the inflation rate develops.,True,plant,True,True
I am confident that we will reach our objective of an inflation rate below but close to 2.0. That's why we should decide to exit the net purchases in December as anticipated.,True,orientation,True,True
We should not bind ourselves for a long period of time with regard to the reinvestments as we cannot exclude the possibility that we will reach our inflation objective earlier than expected or that there will be an increase in negative side effects from our expansionary monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
It should be a tool of last resort to be used only when there is a clear risk of deflation.,True,warfare,True,True
This means that the rate of inflation must reach our aim of below but close to 2 in a sustained manner.,True,orientation,True,True
Core inflation which excludes energy and food prices has for some time been around 1 sometimes even lower and thats not enough to reach our aim in a sustained manner.,True,orientation,False,False
We are confident that underlying inflation pressures are rising but it will take time and it requires monetary policy to remain accommodative.,True,orientation,True,True
A higher oil price pushes up inflation but dampens growth.,True,orientation,True,True
Italys current financing conditions are much too tight for a country with weak growth and low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,False
I am confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to a level below but close to 2 over the medium term will proceed.,True,orientation,True,True
Ample monetary stimulus will remain needed to support a sustained convergence of euro area inflation towards our aim of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Hence the unanimous decision by the Governing Council on the one hand due to the robust growth we are confident that inflation will return to close to 2 and we anticipate our net asset purchase programme to end in December on the other hand we recognise the need to maintain a very accommodative monetary policy.,False,,False,False
Dont forget that these measures were decided on in autumn 2014 in the face of a slowdown in growth and a heightened risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,True
QE has considerably improved the financing conditions of households and firms restarted growth and eliminated the risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,True
We translated the increased confidence we expressed about developments in the economy and inflation into an anticipation about the APP.,True,other,True,True
We undertook a careful review of the progress made towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We think that the underlying strength of the economy gives grounds that inflation convergence will continue in the period ahead even after a gradual winding down of net asset purchases.,True,orientation,True,True
There is a path of gradual improvement towards our inflation aim as the euro area economy will continue to grow above potential.,True,orientation,True,True
Increasing pressure on the utilisation of resources notably in the labour market will continue to support inflation over the medium term.,True,other,True,True
What is crucial is that we see a sustained path of adjustment of inflation towards levels that are below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Over the projection period the contribution of energy to inflation declines and inflation excluding energy and food gradually rises as capacity constraints become increasingly binding.,True,orientation,True,True
It is definitely an option but last week we announced our anticipation of the end of net asset purchases which reflects our confidence that inflation is on course to reach levels below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
This being said our monetary policy decisions altogether maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that is still needed for inflation to converge towards our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
In any case they will stay at their present levels for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.,True,orientation,True,True
And second inflation is returning towards 2 which is the ultimate goal of everything we do.,True,orientation,True,True
They might have got 2.25 interest on their deposits before the euro was introduced but inflation was also much higher back then at 2.4. So what we call the real interest rate was negative then too.,True,orientation,True,True
We expect the economic expansion to continue and we are increasingly confident that inflation will rise towards our aim of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The real activity indicators such as purchasing managers indices are very important but in view of our ultimate objective the way inflation will continue to react will be also very important.,True,other,True,True
Our staff projections indicate that inflation could be subdued in the first part of the year and could increase a bit in the second half of the year.,True,orientation,True,True
Weve ended up with the present inflation targeting regimes using interest rates as the main tool to control the spectrum of market interest rates.,True,warfare,True,True
Well first of all central banks will always focus mostly on control of inflation or more broadly macroeconomic stabilisation.,True,warfare,True,True
The regime of flexible inflation targeting will not change in the visible horizon and that is because it allows central banks to take a mediumterm perspective towards hitting the inflation target.,True,orientation,True,True
The advantage of adopting this gradualist approach to reaching the target is as leading monetary economist and former Riksbank official Lars Svensson has demonstrated very convincingly that you can allow for some consideration of stabilisation of the economy in trying to move gradually towards the inflation target.,True,orientation,True,True
Central banks in the future will have to respond in a different way if they want to achieve the overall objective of reasonable inflation and macroeconomic stabilisation.,True,warfare,True,False
In spite of the favourable growth dynamics underlying inflation continues to be subdued.,True,other,True,True
While our policy measures have been successful in preventing the disinflation of 2014 from spiralling into deflation and are contributing to an improved inflation outlook an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In this regard the transition towards policy normalisation will begin once the Governing Council assesses that there has been a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Such a judgement will be based on three criteria for inflation convergence confidence and resilience.,True,orientation,True,True
Convergence implies that headline inflation will need to be on track to reach levels below but close to 2 within a mediumterm horizon.,True,orientation,True,True
The Governing Council will also need to have confidence that the upward adjustment in inflation has a high enough probability of materialising and that it can do so on a sustainable basis.,True,orientation,True,True
Thirdly resilience it will need to be ensured that the sustained adjustment in the path of inflation will be maintained even without additional net asset purchases.,True,orientation,True,True
In fact confidence has recently risen and convergence is being confirmed partly because the temporary decline in the inflation rate has been weaker than our internal calculations had predicted when we had reduced the purchasing program from EUR 60 billion to EUR 30 billion.,True,orientation,True,True
The former is necessary as it takes time for price pressures to buildup and the latter reflects the fact that the pickup in inflation still needs to be supported by the prevailing monetary policy stance.,True,plant,True,True
Thereafter the monetary support necessary for inflation to converge to our aim of below but close to 2 will be provided by reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time and policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of our net asset purchases.,True,orientation,True,True
But the discussion is not just about asset purchases its also about the right combination of instruments that allows us to support economic activity and bring inflation back towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But whatever the circumstances the ECB has a clear mandate to bring inflation back towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We will do whatever needs to be done to bring inflation back towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But we want to bring inflation back towards 2 in the medium term and that is why monetary policy will remain accommodative.,True,orientation,True,True
That's because the economy and in particular the inflation in the eurozone is not yet where we want to see it.,True,orientation,True,True
In particular as we come closer to the point where our mediumterm inflation objective is met I would expect the role of rate guidance to be strengthened.,True,orientation,True,True
We'll look at how all kinds of circumstances including trade but also the global economy generally and the momentum we have in Europe feeds into eurozone inflation and that will be the basis for our decisions.,True,liquids,True,True
So far we are coming from a starting point which is strong and where we have increasing confidence that our inflation objective will be met.,True,orientation,True,True
We've seen some uptick in inflation even in the most recent numbers.,True,orientation,True,True
The policies we have undertaken especially since 2014 have been quite successful in getting us closer to our inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
But there are uncertainties about the process of inflation given factors like globalisation and technological changes.,True,other,True,True
Mario Draghi raised important questions which have been discussed among central bankers what is the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment NAIRU what is the output gap and how big is the slack?,True,other,False,True
But there is little inflation.,True,other,True,True
Without such a labour supply reaction you would have had wage inflation about 1 percentage point higher and as a consequence higher inflation.,True,other,False,False
However we still see improvements in the path of inflation so the bottom line is not bad at all.,True,orientation,True,True
Another explanation for low wage growth is that there is some backward looking behaviour in the wagesetting mechanism and in inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
Our asset purchases programme has a minimum horizon of end September or beyond if necessary and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We try to see if this fits with the narrowing between the inflation objective and market indicators of inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
For example I look at the gap between the objective of below but close to 2 and the 5year5year forward swapsderived inflation rate which is now at 1.7 percent.,True,other,True,True
Market prices seem to be coherent with the narrowing of the gap between marketbased inflation expectations and our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
When approaching the end of our net asset purchases our forward guidance on policy rates will have to be further specified and calibrated as appropriate to keep inflation on a sustained adjustment path towards our inflation objective.,True,orientation,True,True
Our resilience criterion for inflation is not always understood well.,True,other,True,True
It means that for us to stop net asset purchases we have to be sure that the financial conditions resulting from that announcement will not compromise the adjustment path of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Most likely we will calibrate it as appropriate for inflation to remain on the sustained adjustment path to our inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
We will proceed at a gradual pace or a measured pace as Mario Draghi said in a way that is most appropriate for inflation convergence taking into account continued uncertainty about the size of the output gap and the responsiveness of wages to slack.,True,orientation,True,True
However I would not revise the guidance too early because that could send wrong signals about the end of our net asset purchases which in any case are intended to run until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The influence we have on market prices reflect the credibility of our policy of the central bank and the inflation objective.,True,other,True,True
The primary objective is price stability which we have defined as an inflation rate of below but close to 2 in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Less than six months ago some said that inflation would be below 1 in February or March and growth forecasts were less than half of what they are now.,True,orientation,True,True
But I should say first that inflation is not yet quite where we want it to be the ECBs projections put inflation at 1.4 for next year which is good but not close enough to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
So we are not yet quite where we would like to be in terms of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And inflation would also be half a point weaker.,True,orientation,True,True
We have a mandate which is very simple which is to bring inflation in the euro area back towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
And within that mandate it has ensured the functioning of the euro area it has dealt with speculation it has provided a boost that has allowed growth to pick up again and inflation to move closer to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Growth is accelerating but inflation is still not meeting expectations.,True,machine,True,True
In particular the socalled core inflation for December excluding food and energy components has been disappointing it fell to 0.9 because wages still arent growing sufficiently.,True,orientation,True,True
Historically central banks have often faced inflationary pressures.,True,warfare,True,True
We hope that the adjustment to increased growth and higher inflation in the future will be gradual.,True,machine,True,True
Looking at fundamentals inflation declined slightly in December.,True,orientation,True,True
We see the need for a gradual adjustment of all the elements of our forward guidance if the economy continues to grow and inflation continues to move towards our goal.,True,machine,True,True
With the decision to halve our monthly bond purchases we have adapted our monetary policy to the new economic context and consequently to the higher inflation ahead.,True,machine,True,True
We see no inflation risks.,True,other,True,True
In September the euro area was facing the risk of a further slowdown and inflation was remaining too far away from our 2 objective.,True,orientation,True,True
If it didnt do that it would serve no purpose! And on the other hand in a period where unemployment skyrockets growth slows or there is the threat of deflation as was the case in 2012 and 2014 it is normal for the ECB to be on the side of employment.,True,warfare,True,True
There were those who wanted to make the ECB responsible for Greece leaving the euro area but we resisted that! And the third thing Im proud of is the quantitative easing we launched in 2015 which averted the risk of deflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Being attentive to all consequences on inflation but on all other items as well including the negative effects.,True,other,True,True
The second was fighting deflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ECB in line with other central banks.,True,warfare,True,True
The parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth.,True,other,True,True
Remember what we have seen in these years we've seen the interest rates in Europe very low the spreads between governments much more narrow and the inflation is controlled.,True,machine,True,True
The ECB I think surprised many commentators by being so aggressive to tackle low inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Even this year in the summertime we clarified that the inflation rate of 1.6 is too low so the discussion now is much more precise.,True,other,True,True
We do not find it acceptable to have inflation around 1.6. So 1.6 is not close to 2.,True,other,True,True
We also emphasised in recent months that we view the inflation aim as symmetric.,True,other,True,True
So we care just as much about inflation too low as inflation too high.,True,orientation,True,True
Remember 20 years ago the challenge was to convince everyone that we would keep inflation low.,True,other,True,True
Now the challenge is to convince everyone that we will make sure inflation goes back to where we'd like it.I agree with you many people agree that essentially the last major review was 2003.,True,orientation,True,True
Of course today because of the inflation too low we have this policy but it's a policy about inflation.,True,other,True,True
And so in the future because we do expect inflation to recover and we do not expect that the superlow rate that we see today is necessarily forever I think any government which is benefiting from the low interest rate today as part of their fiscal strategy should be using this opportunity in part to break the debt down in a gradual way.,True,disease,True,True
Let me reassure you that the ECB's policy is about inflation.,True,other,True,True
The most important element of the decision in September was we need to add extra accommodation in our monetary policy that inflation is too low and we need to demonstrate our commitment to having inflation move back towards its target sooner rather than later.,True,orientation,True,True
Underneath everything so whether its about very low interest rates about low inflation underneath everything is how quickly is the European economy going to grow?,False,,False,False
Underneath our interest rate policy decision is again many people here will be familiar with the concept of the real interest rate the inflationadjusted rate which is determined by the intersection of savings and investment.,True,orientation,True,True
So we have this paradox of its unprecedented but its also the case and the inflation numbers tell you its not particularly a super loose policy.,True,other,True,True
If it was super loose inflation would be higher.,True,other,True,False
We do say even though inflation is around 1 now we assess by 2021 itll be 1.5 which would be closer towards the target.,True,orientation,True,True
No matter what the exact definition of the target is the current inflation rate of around 1 is unsatisfactory.,False,,False,False
When were sufficiently far away we need to make sure we are providing the necessary monetary stimulus to help inflation increase over time.,True,plant,True,True
We do not expect the current inflation rate to remain where it is.,False,,True,True
We do expect that all the stimulus we are providing will help inflation to move up over time.,True,orientation,True,True
We now see it in wage inflation which at the euro area level is now in line with our projections.,True,orientation,True,True
What remains is converting the wage inflation into price inflation.,True,machine,True,True
Essentially when we look at the inflation rate when we look at unemployment when we look at investment all we look at is the overall picture.,False,,False,False
Essentially central banks would offset fiscal stimulus if it was proven to be inflationary.,True,warfare,True,True
But in a world of low inflation and low interest rates we think fiscal multipliers under the current conditions are quite high if you have the fiscal space.,True,orientation,True,True
We expected that inflation would fall clearly below 1 in September and October.,True,orientation,True,True
The same applies to core inflation which excludes energy and food prices.,True,other,True,True
The big question is why the current wage increases are not pushing up inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
An environment of low growth and low inflation could deanchor inflation expectations Inflation expectations have recently shown a marked decline but they have not yet become deanchored.,True,orientation,True,True
That could change however as occurred in 2015 when there was a real risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,True
Our models show that the package will have a noticeable positive effect on growth and on inflation over the next two years.,True,other,True,False
And if the inflation outlook should not converge to our aim we will take appropriate action in future too and if necessary adopt new measures.,True,orientation,True,True
The big question at the moment has to be why it is proving difficult to raise inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
When we started taking those measures there was a risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,True
That dangerous situation has been averted theres no longer a risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,True
There has always been symmetry in the implementation of our monetary policy we have always acted decisively whenever inflation has shown signs of deviating from our mediumterm aim.,True,orientation,True,True
That depends on how the economy evolves how inflation evolves and how risks evolve.,True,plant,True,True
Lets not forget that the risk of deflation was averted and that risk was extremely dangerous.,True,warfare,True,True
No. We would have had a credibility problem if deflation had taken hold.,True,disease,True,True
The question is why wage increases are not passing through to price inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB has delivered low inflation and a favourable environment in which Germany has enjoyed ten years of strong growth.,True,plant,True,True
Inflation expectations are not deanchoring but there is a potential risk that they could do so and the threat of deflation could come to the fore.,True,orientation,True,True
The third element we are perhaps overlooking is the reaction function how powerful our instruments are in their ability to push up inflation.,True,machine,True,True
So if you look back over the last few years if you look at the period from 2014 to 2018 essentially the decision in 2014 by the ECB to tackle the risks of a slowgrowing economy and the deflation risk in the euro area meant that during those years from 2014 to 2018 what we saw was a fairly significant recovery.,True,warfare,True,True
We had a big decline in unemployment in Europe a very strong record of job creation and a significant stabilisation of inflation.,True,other,True,True
So compared with the period in 2014 when deflation risk was on the horizon there was a significant recovery in the inflation process through that period.,True,orientation,True,True
And so to more recent monetary policy history at the end of 2018 the decision was made that enough progress had been made in bringing inflation back towards the target that we would end the net asset purchases.,True,orientation,True,True
Well when we made the decision last December to end net purchases under our APP the 2021 inflation forecast from the perspective of December 2018 was at 1.8 so close to 2.,True,other,True,True
So now as of September 2019 before we made this policy decision the 2021 inflation forecast was 1.5. So compared with 1.8 thats a big movement from 1.8 to 1.5. In that context the decision was that we needed to revise our policy stance which as I say is a rate cut reinforced forward guidance reopening of the APP and then theres the redesign of our targeted lending facility and the introduction of this new tiering system for how banks will be exempted to some extent from the implications of negative interest rates on their excess liquidity.,True,other,True,True
Were not saying that theres a serious recession risk were not saying that theres a serious derailment of inflation but there was a need to make a correction.,True,machine,True,True
When you do have inflation below the target when you already have done a lot of accommodation it is important not to react to every little blip in the data.,True,other,True,True
The European economy will grow we are projecting inflation to continue to increase the labour market is very strong wages are growing at quite a clip now.,True,plant,True,True
As of now weve got the rate where it is but we clearly signal that if needed if theres further downgrading of the inflation outlook which is perceived to be persistent and requires a response we can do more.,True,other,True,True
When you have the inflation forecast going from 1.8 to 1.5 you cant be indifferent about that.,True,other,True,True
Thats a significant move and the world needs to understand that we will be responding to these significant downgrades by making sure the monetary conditions are sufficient to make sure the momentum of getting inflation back towards our target is restored.,True,machine,True,True
The cornerstone of persistent inflation pressure is whats happening to wages.,True,other,True,True
The history of the euro area is that when unemployment gets into the sevens then the labour market gets hot enough that were seeing nominal wage increases of the order which if they are passed through we will have inflation back towards our target.,True,fire,True,True
So under the forecast where we expect the labour market to continue to strengthen there is significant momentum in inflation.,True,machine,True,True
So we do think the basic inflation mechanics remain as usual and its just important in this period of belowtarget inflation that we address it through easy conditions.,True,machine,True,True
So if you ask me if it takes longer to hit the inflation target because the labour market turns out to be much stronger than you thought fantastic.,True,other,True,True
We are saying that unless the inflation pressure is there we have to keep the monetary accommodation as extensive as required.,True,other,True,True
So it is kind of unchartered territory to see unemployment come down so low without inflation but thats not bad thats good.,True,orientation,True,True
But it does require central banks to respond to that to make sure Because the idea that this good news story about our strong labour markets is inconsistent with delivering the inflation target that would be a failure by the central banking community.,True,other,True,True
The central banking community has to make sure that its policy levers are set to make sure inflation does get to target in this new world of betterperforming labour markets.,True,machine,True,True
So this symmetry debate we have tried to clarify it because we said in our July monetary policy statement that we view our inflation targets as symmetric.,True,other,True,True
That we will be as energetic When you go back in history in the first years of the euro the big impetus was on convincing everyone that the ECB would not be soft on inflation.,True,other,True,True
Many countries had a history of inflation above 2 and so the main impetus was on making sure everyone understood that abovetarget inflation would need a response.,True,other,True,True
Because of course the Fed has done many things but in terms of the nature of what the ECB has done its been quite aggressive in dealing with belowtarget inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Now there are other elements as to how do you reinforce the inflation target especially when youve spent a long time away from it.,True,other,True,True
In the grand scheme of things we had this tremendous convergence in central banking towards inflation targeting officiallyunofficially flexibleless flexible so by and large central banks work in very similar ways and Im pretty sure thats going to continue.,True,other,True,True
The most important assessment in the September meeting was after we had a joint assessment in July that inflation was below target that was confirmed in September and there was a very high degree of consensus that a monetary easing was required.,True,other,True,True
But in the end the decision was taken and thats the most important news story to understand what this means how this is going to permeate the financial system how this is going to affect the real economy and affect the dynamics of inflation.,True,other,True,True
But were also clear that all of our decisions have to be in the context of what is needed to get inflation to the target.,True,other,True,True
Furthermore after the great financial crisis the Eurozone had low inflation and the highest level of unemployment probably since the Great Depression.,True,orientation,True,True
We also need to reiterate that we are symmetric in pursuing our objective i.e. that to keep inflation above our target as much as below it.,True,orientation,True,True
A combination of monetary and fiscal policies might have delivered similar results on growth and inflation but faster and at a higher level of interest rates.,True,orientation,True,True
Having said that inflation expectations are actually going down everywhere.,True,orientation,True,True
There is a structural component which keeps inflation low because otherwise it would only be a eurozone phenomenon.,True,orientation,True,True
This sooner or later will translate itself into higher inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Our measures will stay in place until the economy recovers and inflation robustly converges again towards our aim of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
This forward guidance dependent on the inflation outlook is the key element of our September decision.,True,other,True,True
Inflation is below our aim but there is no danger of deflation meaning a general fall in price levels.,True,orientation,True,True
Projected inflation for 2021 stood at 1.8 in December 2018.,True,orientation,True,True
But in March this year the ECB had to revise its outlook for growth and inflation significantly downwards and in September projected inflation was revised down again to 1.5. So we waited until September to provide a comprehensive response.,True,orientation,True,True
In the medium term we want to see a stronger economy higher inflation and definitely also positive interest rates again.,True,orientation,True,True
Were looking at a temporary economic slowdown but there is no recession and the risk of deflation is low at present.,True,orientation,True,True
Second its important that if the government increases spending and stimulates the economy it doesnt cause inflation to rise too far.,True,orientation,True,True
And there is no risk of inflation being too high at the moment.,True,orientation,True,True
Anyone in the finance ministry can see that euro area inflation is well below our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
Our monetary policy has so far had a clearly positive impact on financing conditions for firms and households and is thus supporting growth and inflation.,True,other,True,False
The exchange rate is of course one factor for the economy and hence also for inflation in this context the exchange rate is an important element but not the objective of our monetary policy.,True,other,True,True
If inflation is above our aim of inflation at levels that are below but close to 2 we try just as hard to get it there as when inflation is below the aim.,True,orientation,True,True
The aim must be crystal clear especially when inflation is low.,True,orientation,True,True
But it must be certain that inflation can be anchored above zero again.,True,orientation,True,True
For instance we should analyse how other central banks behave when it comes to inflation targets.,True,other,True,True
How do you deal with below target inflation?,False,,True,False
Its about the imperative to move as quickly as you can to reach the inflation aim versus recognising side effects and so on and maybe having a different view about how quickly and how proactively you should respond.,False,,False,False
If I go back to December last year where we ended the net APP the projected inflation rate for 2021 was at 1.8 .,False,,False,False
We do think this will visibly move the pathway for the outlook of inflation but of course it's hard to demonstrate.,False,,True,False
Across those rates of models we're convinced that this will have a sufficiently significant positive contribution to inflation.,False,,True,False
Because by way of contrast by way of a counterexample you can have flatout convergence in the inflation outlook meaning you can see a surge in the target.,False,,False,False
You can see headline inflation could be quite persistent but not in a robust way because it would be driven by some disruption in oil markets you can see those sometimes or other disruptions that come out of the markets.,False,,True,False
The second part of the guidance is that it's basically aligned with the realised path the underlying inflation dynamics because you could possibly you don't want to have a modelling error where you see the economies would take off like a rocket and so you say inflation is going to accelerate really sharply.,True,machine,True,True
I'm sure models exist that would have that feature but given the persistence of inflation which many models don't fully capture we are saying we also need to see actual inflation the outcomes especially across the indicators especially we need to strip out the volatile elements sufficiently in the neighbourhood of where you want to get to.,False,,False,False
So if inflation today is low and you forecast a high number two years from now it's fair to say well we've not seen it.,False,,True,False
We're seeing inflation move maybe sometimes in an incremental way.,False,,False,False
So the connection between the outcome and the forecast is basically saying there's a modelling error and maybe it's safer to wait until the actual realised inflation is not too far away.,True,orientation,True,True
Lane Whatever it takes to get through to inflation and align it with our targets.,True,warfare,True,True
Obviously the passthrough and this goes back maybe to what you asked me about the mapping for the inflation outcome it obviously depends also on what's happening with other policy levers especially fiscal so the impact of our policies on inflation does depend on the fiscal decisions.,False,,False,False
But the mapping of our measures to the overall economy and to inflation does depend on what's going to happen and the decisions made in terms of setting fiscal policy now.,False,,True,False
That's really a big driver of the macroforecast for the outlook of inflation.,False,,True,False
I think one element is defining symmetry and the way we communicate about this i.e. policy really basically we will be as reactive below the inflation aim as we would be above.,False,,False,False
So it's basically saying the size of the reaction is the same whether we're below target or above target which I think needed clarifying because given the price stability definition is zero to two we kept on seeing people interpreting our inflation aim as asymmetric because they confounded the aim which was below but close to 2 with interpreting some kind of hard ceiling there too which is not the case.,False,,True,True
We think it's enough to lift the pathway for inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And I am still convinced that the Asset Purchase Programme APP is theultima ratio and it should only be used if you have a risk of deflation and the risk of deflation is nowhere to be seen now.,True,warfare,True,True
Im sceptical to link forward guidance solely to inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
For me its asymmetric as the Governing Council has defined price stability as an inflation rate of below 2 over the medium term while our inflation aim is defined asclose tobut below 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We continuously assess the state of the economy and stand ready to act to keep inflation on a path to our aimAskECB Lane The Phillips Curve is a useful framework it combines the dual influences of activity levels and inflation expectations in determining inflation outcomes.,False,,False,False
At the ECB we look at many specifications of the Phillips Curve rather than rely on a single version.AskECB Lane While the euro area is doing well along some dimensions inflation remains below target and there are downside risks to the growth outlook.,False,,False,False
Substantial accommodation is still required to bring inflation back to aim.,True,orientation,True,True
The European Semester monitors fiscal and reform effortsAskECB Lane While some households may save more others will avail of low rates to increase consumption and household investment home renovations etc.AskECB Lane Proactive measures including negative rates are the surest way to ensure inflation climbs to our aim a temporary period of negative rates is the pathway to positive rates in the future.AskECB Lane We do not see a recession although the prolongation of uncertainties is weighing on our growth outlookAskECB Lane Benoît Cœuré my colleague on the ECBs Executive Board leads the G7 working group on stablecoins.,False,,False,False
Such relative price movements are not new and do not change the economics of inflationAskECB Lane Youll find the list of banks participating in our instant payments system herehttpswww.ecb.europa.eupaymtargettipsfactshtmlindex.en.htmlAskECB Lane We are not here to give investment advice remember you invest at your own risk.,False,,False,False
When we need to use them we will choose the one most suitable for the situationAskECB Lane No. Bitcoin is not a currency it rather is an asset and it is very volatileAskECB Lane Banking union and the creation of a level playing field including a key role for the single supervisory mechanism SSM provide important support for a more efficient panEuropean banking system.AskECB Lane Yes we are prepared and ready to act if needed to keep inflation on track towards our aim.,False,,False,False
Our policies are most effective if other actors do their partAskECB Lane Since 2014 our policies have been successful in eliminating deflation risk and fostering strong recovery in employment in Europe.,False,,False,False
Our focus is on returning inflation to our aimAskECB Lane Our asset purchases have been very successful by lowering financing conditions for firms and households and have led to the creation of millions of new jobs over recent years.AskECB Lane She is an excellent choice for the ECB.,False,,False,False
We are transparent on this please take a look at the accounts of Governing Council meetingshttpswww.ecb.europa.eupressaccounts2019htmlindex.en.htmlAskECB Lane Our goal is not to make markets happy but rather to provide favourable financing conditions that can stimulate the real economy and anchor inflation expectationsAskECB Lane The optimal currency area OCA concept is very useful but does not provide a precise roadmap.,False,,True,False
Its because our objective is to ensure that inflation comes back to our objective which is close to but below 2 and were not there yet.,True,orientation,True,True
Its a policy which has created tens of millions of jobs in the euro area which is supporting activity and thus a return of inflation towards 2 and which is all the more necessary right now when we are facing a slowdown in the global economy and significant global risks which are not related to Europe but rather to trade tensions caused by various countries and which are affecting confidence.,True,orientation,True,True
There is no deflation in the euro area we are not talking about a risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,False
Our current monetary policy is designed to respond to a very specific situation namely to a low growth low inflation environment which should not last forever.,True,orientation,True,True
So if you like the main conclusion of my talk today is that we should be confident that even under these conditions the ECB has the policy measures to allow it to respond to shocks to the economy shocks to inflation.,False,,False,False
Compared to say 2014 theres been a good recovery of inflation so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards.,True,orientation,True,True
So I think its important to be in the middle inflation is recovering we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over.,True,disease,True,True
What we need to see is a deanchoring of inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
This has not yet happened despite the fact that there has been a drop in marketbased inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
But for now our monetary policy stance is fully compatible with both inflation and real activity.,True,other,True,True
Both in terms of real activity and in terms of inflation.,True,other,True,True
Monetary policy has to take care of price stability and some real factors that can explain inflation levels across the euro area.,True,other,True,True
On average inflation has been lower since 1999.,False,,True,False
So one of the euros concrete objectives to control inflation has been achieved.,True,machine,True,True
Weve had seminars among central banks too on its impact on relative prices inflation and the structure of production.,True,machine,True,True
There was a high risk of deflation in the euro area.,True,disease,True,True
So it was absolutely right to counteract this danger by lowering interest rates and to generally loosen monetary policy in order for us to bring inflation to a level below but close to 2.,True,warfare,True,True
Again we had to respond to the risk of deflation and we have come nearer to our aim of maintaining an appropriate level of inflation over the medium term.,True,disease,True,True
That is also why inflation remains subdued.,True,animal,True,True
Praet Better understanding inflation dynamics dealing with the lower bound and making policy within an incomplete monetary union AskECB PraetThe Governing Council is a collegial body.,False,,True,False
The side effects are outweighed by the positive effects on financing conditions for firms and households AskECB Praet We are en route to reaching our inflation target.,True,orientation,True,False
That 75 of Europeans support the euro is telling AskECB Praet If we had had a specific month in mind we wouldnt have been shy about saying it AskECB Praet Our policies are necessary for sustained convergence of inflation towards below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In the past this has resulted in hyperinflation and economic turmoil.,True,disease,True,True
I will also miss the sense of humour of central bankers AskECB Praet We are confident that our current policy is appropriate to bring inflation back to our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
At the last Governing Council meeting we reiterated our determination to provide the monetary accommodation needed for a sustained convergence of inflation AskECB Praet Unfortunately I cannot answer your specific question.,True,orientation,True,True
They previously envisaged that growth would be consistently above potential which would have pushed inflation towards our objective of lower but close to 2 whereas they now foresee that actual output will be initially equal to or below potential output which means it will take longer for inflation to reach 2.,True,orientation,True,True
It will take longer for inflation to reach our objective but it will get there.,True,orientation,True,True
What matters is knowing when this increase will translate into a pickup in underlying inflation which excludes the most volatile product prices like energy prices.,True,machine,True,True
Even if energy prices were to fall a little in the coming months we are confident that inflation will over the medium term converge towards our aim of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
At our last monetary policy meeting we upheld the assessment that inflation will converge to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Downside risks to growth could then lead to downside risks to inflation in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
And as far as their path is concerned we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Moreover we have made it clear that in any event we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards our inflation aim in a sustained manner.,True,orientation,True,True
In case we would cease to be confident that inflation is converging to a level that is below but close to 2 it would be our mandate to act.,True,orientation,True,True
We expected a dip in the inflation ratio.,True,orientation,True,True
It was clear that with the base effects of the energy prices the inflation rate would drop.,True,orientation,True,True
Thats why weve always said that we need to see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation not a change in the month that we just had but a sustained adjustment.,True,orientation,True,True
The core inflation rate didnt dip that much.,True,orientation,True,True
We are confident that what we have done is helping us to get inflation in line with our objective at levels below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
If we identify a deviation we analyse the reasons for it and the impact it is likely to have on inflation.,True,machine,True,True
We will then judge whether it is still in line with our inflation expectations as price stability is the only needle in our compass.,True,orientation,True,True
And we have an inflation rate that's below 2 but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
In addition the shortterm interest rates that the ECB controls directly are going to stay at their current level i.e. at zero and even below zero at least through the summer of 2019 and for as long as required for inflation to return towards 2 which is our aim.,False,,False,False
It isnt a major turnaround its an adjustment which is justified by the fact that this programme was launched in 2015 when the euro area was on the edge of a precipice faced with the risk of deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Since its time to reflect on the past 20 years I would say the euro as a currency has been a huge success its stable inflation has been considerably lower in the last 20 years than in the decades before that and this has supported purchasing power it has supported the purchasing power of Europeans.,False,,False,True
.but this isnt linked to price inflation.,False,,True,False
Price inflation since 1999 has been 1.6 on average.,False,,True,False
If you look at the 20 years before that before the euro was created inflation was 4.,False,,False,False
In other words even if wed kept the franc there would have been inflation and thats what people are not seeing.,False,,False,False
Thats true but what allows the ECB to be independent is its very narrow very clear very simple and very precise mandate which is to bring the inflation rate back towards 2.,False,,False,False
We did it because we were on the brink of deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We brought inflation back towards 2 we created ten million jobs and if its good for employment its also good for European citizens.,True,orientation,True,True
Everything we do creating liquidity buying securities cutting interest rates to zero is to support both output and inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
Economic growth inflation would be lower without it.,True,orientation,True,True
The duration of the PEPP will depend on the evolution of the pandemic and its consequences for the economic and inflation outlook.AskECB Schnabel It is important that fiscal and monetary policies work hand in hand to overcome this deep crisis.,True,disease,True,False
We are therefore not concerned about the evolution of TARGET2 balances.AskECB Schnabel The evolution of our policy rates depends on the inflation outlook which is currently subdued.,True,plant,True,True
We expect rates to remain at present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2.AskECB Schnabel In a bankbased economy like the euro area banks are key for the transmission of our monetary policy to the real economy.,True,orientation,True,True
Therefore liquidityproviding measures are a standard monetary policy instrument to affect lending conditions and inflation.AskECB Schnabel The HICP calculated independently byEU_EurostatEU_Eurostat already includes rents.,True,machine,True,True
The Governing Council expects to conclude the review in the 2nd half of 2021AskECBMore information herehttpsecb.europa.euhomesearchreviewhtmlworkstreams.en.html Schnabel We took swift actions to counter the shock from the pandemic on our inflation outlook.,True,warfare,True,True
We remain undeterred in our commitment to bring inflation back to our mediumterm aim of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But the speed of return depends on the shocks we are facing.AskECB Schnabel Two AskECB Schnabel The sources of shocks are important for the passthrough of exchange rate changes to inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
So if we can keep financing conditions where they are these days at a low level that supports the economic recovery and offsetting the pandemic shock to inflation.,True,disease,True,True
I do think coming back to the basic point here the force of hyperglobalisation which surely contributed to antiinflation pressures is probably going to be weaker.,True,warfare,True,True
Im going to remind you that in our forward guidance we do say that we are prepared to lower interest rates if necessary to support the convergence of inflation to our mediumterm aim.,True,orientation,True,True
Its not just interest rates today but we reassure you that interest rates are not going to rise until there is more pressure on inflation.,True,other,True,True
So these discussions about financial stability the optimal speed to close the inflation gap and so on are all absolutely part of our strategy review and part of the global conversation about how you balance these different considerations as part of a monetary policy framework.,True,other,True,True
So again its not the case that were projecting were going to hit our inflation aim in the near term.,True,orientation,True,True
The nearterm goal is to undo the damage the pandemic has done to the inflation path.,True,disease,True,True
So thats not going to deliver us the inflation aim over our projection horizon.,True,orientation,True,True
But its important to break into steps the overall objective of getting inflation towards close to but below 2.,True,orientation,True,True
In terms of what were doing now its useful to have to focus on saying look lets see if we can undo the damage of the pandemic restore inflation to the trajectory it was on and then of course over time it will be a sustained effort as it has been since at least 2015 which goes back to the fact that we know its important to recognise that were going to move towards the inflation aim in a gradual way.,True,disease,True,True
Its very difficult to live with a reversal of that momentum to see inflation dropping.,True,orientation,True,True
Right now in the middle of a pandemic we understand why inflation is so low.,True,disease,True,True
Its important that we restore momentum to the inflation path in order to get us back on that trajectory which over time and in a gradual way will bring us to the inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
What I always say is that its important that we see the momentum its important that we see inflation move in the right direction.,True,orientation,True,True
Of course that cannot be immediate were not trying to say that inflation in the first quarter of 2021 will respond to our current policies.,True,other,True,True
But over the time horizon of monetary policy we have to see an improvement in the inflation path.,True,orientation,True,True
So its not so much the reversal of the very low inflation now its going from the 1 tight range once those are reversed to bring inflation momentum up from 1 to the mid 1s towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The key issue is how do you maintain expected inflation at your targeted level when the reality is that youre going to spend a lot of time away from the target?,True,orientation,True,True
But also its a matter of logic that there could be a very wide family of different strategies which basically have the same intent which is to make sure that mediumterm expected inflation remains at the target even when there are negative shocks.,True,other,True,True
The policies to make all of that consistent in terms of how you respond when youre close to the lower bound how you respond if inflation is temporarily just above the target all of that needs to be worked through.,True,other,True,True
It seems likely that this weakening is going to stretch into the next year and also that the inflation outlook may be subdued for some time.,True,orientation,True,True
We should now focus on preserving these favourable financing conditions for as long as necessary in order to support the recovery reduce the potential scarring effects and counter the negative impact of the pandemic on the inflation outlook.,True,warfare,True,True
Whats always on the top of our minds is our main goal the inflation objective.,True,orientation,True,True
Where we do have some flexibility is the time horizon over which we get back to the inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
In a situation like today where already before the pandemic the economy had been hit by longlasting structural shocks that continue to have a disinflationary impact it may take longer to achieve our aim.,True,warfare,True,True
We are not happy with that level of inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
But its not only about marketbased inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
Other types of inflation expectations also matter what do firms and households expect?,False,,True,False
If we look at the joint effect of the asset purchases and TLTROs since March our calculations show that they are expected to have a cumulative effect on inflation of 0.8 percentage points and on growth of 1.3 percentage points between 2020 and 2022.,True,other,True,True
In the end we will have to get back to our inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
We have an inflation aim of below but close to 2 but we already now stress in our introductory statements that there is a commitment to symmetry.,True,orientation,True,True
And that means it will not happen that once the inflation rate crosses a certain threshold we will immediately fight against the increase in inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
We have always stressed that what we would need to see is a sustained increase in inflation.,True,other,True,True
And if you see such a sustained increase in inflation its likely that this reflects an overall more robust economy at least if the shocks are coming from the demand side.,True,warfare,True,True
However it is true that they are a reflection of the situation in the 1990s when inflation and growth hovered around 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We also look at the evolution of inflation which is our primary mandate.,True,plant,True,True
Inflation will be negative until the end of the year and we expect that it will turn positive next year because some drivers of this negative inflation will be reverted for instance the reductions in value added tax or the sharp decline in oil prices caused by the lack of economic activity.,True,orientation,True,True
All in all we expect inflation to be close to 1 in 2021 and to see it moving up towards 1.2 or 1.3 in 2022.,True,orientation,True,True
This combined with very low inflation expectations has created a situation where nominal interest rates which are the ones we observe in the markets are very low.,True,machine,True,True
Both headline and core inflation have been low over the last ten years and as I mentioned there are some structural factors such as digitalisation globalisation and demographics that help explain why.,True,other,True,True
In 2015 and 2016 there was a clear risk of deflation and the ECB acted to avoid it and to anchor inflation expectations.,True,warfare,True,True
For instance globalisation will likely not be as intense as it has been in recent decades as the pandemic could make value chains more regional which might have an impact on inflation.,True,other,True,True
However according to our projections inflation will remain low and we will therefore keep monetary policy accommodative so that inflation can converge to our medium term aim.,True,orientation,True,True
The outlook for inflation has clearly deteriorated rather than improved over the past few months owing to the resurgence of the pandemic and the containment measures taken in response.,True,disease,True,True
The euro area has suffered a huge economic shock with considerable downside risks that have threatened to set selfreinforcing recessionary and deflationary dynamics in motion.,True,disease,True,True
The second element involves calibrating our stance to reflect our commitment to bring inflation back to our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
We must do this without undue delay in order to eliminate any possible question marks over our determination to preserve price stability our primary mandate and to avoid a disanchoring of inflation expectations with the second wave some of the downside risks have materialised and the starting point for the inflation outlook is now lower than a few months ago.,True,orientation,True,True
And there should be no doubt as to our commitment to bring inflation back to our aim and therefore the continuity of our policies even when the recovery gets underway.,True,orientation,True,True
We want to see inflation converge towards our aim in a sustained manner and we cannot hesitate in taking decisive measures if we wish to avoid the risk of a downward adjustment in inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
The recovery would then take even longer and inflation could continue to hover at very low levels.,True,orientation,True,True
And even in the optimistic scenario inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued and to recover very slowly.,True,disease,True,True
The economy is currently subject to lockdown measures and inflation is moving away from our objective of 2 so we need to take action to stimulate demand and strengthen the inflation path.,True,orientation,True,True
As long as the interest rate is below the growth rate I think the issues of sustainability might not be in the foreground however we have a mandate to respect price stability and we could not look the other way if there were to be inflationary pressures which we do not see at this point in time.,True,warfare,True,True
We will also have to establish other conditions in terms of economic recovery and inflation dynamics but its still too early to do this.,True,machine,True,True
As we say in our forward guidance our net purchases under our asset purchase programme will continue until we are in a position to raise interest rates which will require inflation to be back in the neighbourhood of our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
So ending asset purchases depends on whats happening to inflation.,True,other,True,False
In our September projections which will be updated in December we dont see inflation reaching our aim in the next two years.,True,orientation,True,True
That's why we continue to say that we expect rates to be at their current or lower levels until inflation has returned robustly to where we want it to be.,True,orientation,True,True
But it will come to an end once the pandemic crisis ends as will the associated impact on the economy and inflation.,True,disease,True,True
It is mostly driven by domestic factors but the exchange rate does of course matter for the future of the GDP and inflation dynamics.,True,machine,True,True
If the inflation projection is not satisfactory then we respond.,True,other,True,False
What the Governing Council said is that in the December meeting we will recalibrate our instruments as appropriate in order to preserve favourable financing conditions and counteract the impact of the pandemic on our inflation outlook.,True,machine,True,True
One important question in our monetary policy strategy review is what this actually implies for the inflation objective.,True,other,True,False
So there are people who are proposing to raise the inflation target but of course there you get an issue of credibility because if you havent been able to hit 2 will you be able to hit 3?,True,sports,True,True
So something like average inflation targeting which works through an expectations channel.,True,machine,True,True
Many models are based on the assumption that inflation reverts to a longterm average.,True,orientation,True,False
After the financial crisis people underestimated how prolonged the downward effect of such a shock on inflation would be.,True,orientation,True,True
Moreover inflation projections are frequently reported merely as point estimates.,True,other,True,True
After the crisis we must at some point fall back on our regular toolbox in order to bring inflation to a rate consistent with our price stability definition.,True,machine,True,True
Thanks to the action we took between March and June we estimate that growth will be 1.3 percentage points higher overall and inflation 0.8 percentage points higher.,True,orientation,True,True
The PEPP has a dual objective first to stabilise the markets and this objective has been fulfilled next to help bring inflation back to its prepandemic path while keeping interest rates low and ensuring that these low rates are passed on to the real economy which has worked.,True,orientation,True,True
The GDP contraction hit double digits in the second quarter with disinflationary effects.,True,warfare,True,True
This in turn has sustained the flow of financing to households and firms supporting aggregate demand and avoiding a more pronounced fall in inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
Both actual inflation and expected inflation are already too low.,True,orientation,True,True
In September the euro area headline inflation rate was negative for the second month in a row 0.3 while inflation excluding the volatile energy and food components was 0.2. ECB staff have projected that inflation will rise to only 1.3 in 2022 but the most recent inflation data show that there is a risk of inflation dynamics being weaker than projected.,True,orientation,True,False
Marketbased inflation expectations are subdued and consumers inflation expectations have also declined continuously since April.,True,orientation,True,True
We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments as appropriate to achieve our objective of bringing inflation back to our mediumterm aim in a sustained manner.,True,machine,True,True
First it should reduce our tolerance for inflation drifting downwards away from our aim and prompt us to treat our inflation aim as perfectly symmetric.,True,orientation,True,True
Second the instruments we have activated in recent years such as asset purchases and targeted lending to banks have been key to containing the risk of deflation and should remain in our toolbox this would have a stabilising effect and reduce the probability that we have to use those instruments again in the future.,True,machine,True,True
The most important driver of inflation dynamics is the amount of slack in the economy.,True,machine,True,True
When were operating in the second quarter at 15 percentage points below 2019 levels only half of that has been offset by now and well have a 5 percentage point gap by the end of 2020 that is by far the biggest issue for inflation.,True,machine,True,True
It's also not so much that the central bank is looking at the exchange rate per se it's the implications for the European economy and for inflation.,True,other,True,True
We understand why inflation is slightly negative right now.,True,orientation,True,True
Thats a huge amount of slack so its not surprising that we have very low or slightly negative inflation in these months.,True,machine,True,True
And this is why we do think that inflation is going to climb.,True,orientation,True,True
What is true is that the current inflation level remains far away from our goal.,True,orientation,True,True
We dont think that is a satisfactory inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
So I think its true to say that we would like to see a stronger momentum in inflation.,True,machine,True,True
Meeting by meeting we will have to make that call where do we think inflation is going?,False,,True,False
In addition we all to different degrees are below where we would like to be in terms of the inflation rate.,True,orientation,True,False
One of the issues is whether the sustained period of low inflation might get locked into inflation expectations.,True,machine,True,True
In terms of our monetary policy strategy review its important that our mediumterm orientation is to get inflation back to where we think it should be.,True,orientation,True,True
The main concern raised with us is please tell me youre committed that your monetary policy is committed to get inflation back towards the aim.,True,orientation,True,True
Our monetary policy today even before the strategy review says that were not going to tighten the interest rate until we see inflation robustly converge to the aim.,True,orientation,True,True
In other words we need to see a lot of evidence that the inflation outlook is in the neighbourhood of the aim.,True,orientation,True,True
And we have a second condition that weve seen that robust convergence reflected in realised inflation dynamics.,True,orientation,True,True
Its not just that were forecasting two years from now that inflation is going to pick up but that weve already seen a good pickup in underlying inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
So theres a lot of similarity between our current forward guidance and that family of policies which all say were not going to have kneejerk policy tightening were going to make sure that inflation is in the neighbourhood of where we want it to be before we tighten.,True,orientation,True,True
All the action weve taken since 2014 was in order to respond to inflation that was dropping below the target.,True,orientation,True,True
There would be asymmetry if anyone was concerned that the ECB would quickly suppress inflation that went above the aim but tolerate belowtarget inflation so long as it was above zero and below two.,True,orientation,True,True
But the evidence shows that weve been very symmetric that weve done a lot since 2014 to respond to the fact that inflation has been too low.,True,orientation,True,True
Anyone who pays attention to our policies and forward guidance knows that we will not tighten policy without inflation solidly appearing in the data.,True,orientation,True,True
Essentially the conditions under which we would tighten policy are driven by the inflation outlook.,True,machine,True,True
The interest rate policy is crystal clear and if the conditions in respect of inflation warrant a tightening of policy thats what the ECB is going to do.,True,machine,True,True
Weve said that when the inflation outlook allows it they will be rolled off.,True,machine,True,True
Moreover a monetary financing of public debt would be expected to raise inflation expectations as was the case in the 1970s.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB is faced with the opposite scenario expectations remain well below our inflation aim of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But inflation is still very distant from levels in line with our inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
It is true that while employment growth has been strong before the COVID19 pandemic underlying inflation remained below its historical average in the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
Yet that does not mean that the Phillips curve relationship is broken or that the effect of monetary policy on the real economy does not transmit to inflation.,True,machine,True,True
Empirical studies show that the slope of the Phillips curve is rather small in the euro area which means that unemployment has to fall more to put pressure on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We will take stock of the drivers of inflation also relating to structural developments and assess to what extent they warrant a different approach to monetary policy decisionmaking.,True,machine,True,True
1 October 2020 First of all its implicit in our projections that for the rest of this year the inflation rate is going to be hovering around zero to negative partly because of the pandemic and the evolution of the crisis and partly because of VAT rebates not only in Germany but also in other countries like Ireland.,True,orientation,True,True
For 2021 the base effect is going to play in favour of a rebound in inflation because the VAT rebates will disappear and the price of oil is most likely not going to continue declining.,True,sports,True,True
So we expect to see a certain bounceback of the economy that will have a positive impact on inflation.,True,sports,True,True
And finally in 2022 we are projecting that the inflation rate will be on average 1.21.3. But the further ahead you look the more difficult the projections are.,True,orientation,True,True
So we are discounting that for the rest of the year the inflation rate will be negative or very close to zero.,True,orientation,True,True
But we are monitoring inflation continuously and as always we are totally open to recalibrating our measures in accordance with our inflation projections.,True,machine,True,True
Then we need to observe inflation developments.,True,other,True,True
It will come but when exactly depends on the evolution of the pandemic on the evolution of the economy on the projections on inflation and on the situation in financial markets as we are putting a lot of emphasis on avoiding a tightening of financial conditions.,True,orientation,True,True
We closely monitor the development of the exchange rate because it has an impact on the evolution of the economy and inflation.,True,other,True,True
If any concrete situation or variable jeopardises our inflation objective for sure we will react.,True,warfare,True,False
When we make our projections about inflation we take into consideration the exchange rate and its evolution.,True,other,True,True
It is included in our models and so indirectly it has an impact on inflation.,True,machine,True,True
These actions will have an impact on inflation and activity and therefore we have to take them into consideration in our projections and reaction function.,True,machine,True,True
See full overview herehttpsecb.europa.eupresskeydate2020htmlecb.sp2008271957819fff.en.htmlAskECB Lane NoAskECB Lane Rather than deflation risk our primary concern is inflation remaining below our aim for an excessive periodAskECB Lane We agree that trust in the central bank is essential.,False,,True,False
This being said it is obvious that the recent movement in the exchange rate has had statistical effects on some of our measures of inflation and production.,True,other,True,True
The measurement of inflation is one of the first work streams that has been internally discussed.,True,other,True,True
For the moment we believe that the programme is performing well also from the point of view of pursuing our primary objective our inflation aim.,True,other,True,True
That being said when the ECB calculates its inflation projections it also takes into account economic variables such as economic growth and employment.,True,machine,True,True
Our inflation projections indicate that the risk is inflation being very low not very high.,True,orientation,True,True
After the pandemic in theory there is the possibility of value chains being less efficient and less global and that this will cause inflation to increase.,True,machine,True,True
But we also take this into account when we make our projections and even then inflation is projected to reach 1.3 in 2022 which is clearly below the ECBs definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
However when I said earlier that we monitor a very broad range of economic variables that includes the exchange rate because it affects mediumterm inflation expectations.,True,machine,True,True
We will monitor it we will analyse it it will be an input for the models we use to calculate our inflation projections but our ultimate objective in doing so is not to influence the exchange rate.,True,machine,True,True
Rather we do it because of the impact the exchange rate has on inflation.,True,other,True,True
It is an important variable as the appreciation of the euro has an impact on our inflation projections and these projections influence our monetary policy.,True,machine,True,True
Not because of the exchange rate itself but because of its ramifications for inflation in the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
We adjust our policies according to the mediumterm inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
We continue monitoring incoming information carefully including developments in the exchange rate and we stand ready to act if the incoming data is not consistent with the objective of our emergency measures to close the inflation gap that has emerged as a result of the pandemic.,True,warfare,True,True
Instead we see a protracted recovery that takes time and the same is true for the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
Regarding inflation we never base our decisions on just one month of data we focus on how it evolves over the medium term.,True,plant,True,True
We see that our measures provide tangible support to core inflation which was however partly offset by other factors.,True,machine,True,True
I think that there is a need to communicate this better and to also work on a better understanding of what the inflation rate actually measures.,True,other,True,True
No because these reinvestments are limited to a specific time period or are contingent on a sustained return of inflation to our aim implying that purchases are not unlimited.,True,orientation,True,True
We had a big increase in the pandemic emergency purchase programme PEPP at that time due to a very subdued inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
Second the PEPP is also there to close the inflation gap created by the pandemic.,True,other,True,True
If you look at this stance element of the PEPP since the inflation outlook is quite subdued there is clearly a need to remain active in the market.,True,orientation,True,True
Its calibrated in order to close the inflation gap and we have rules on how this is distributed across the different segments although there is some flexibility.,True,machine,True,True
How all this translates into inflation is not entirely clear.,True,other,True,True
The effects of climate change will have implications for price stability and inflation which lie at the heart of the ECBs mandate.,True,other,True,True
Having such a fascination for inflation I like to make a few onthespot checks smiles.,True,other,True,True
Without our measures the pandemic would have pushed inflation well below 2.,True,orientation,True,True
By the end of 2022 we estimate that the measures decided since March both the purchase programmes and the refinancing operations will produce a cumulative increase of 0.8 percentage points in inflation and 1.3 percentage points in GDP.,True,other,True,True
Until were sure that the effects of the crisis have been reabsorbed we will need to go on providing a strong monetary stimulus to consolidate the recovery thus bringing the inflation level back up.,True,orientation,True,True
Our latest macroeconomic projections were published in June which was when we decided to expand our measures because we saw that the economic and in particular the inflation outlook had deteriorated substantially.,True,disease,True,True
The PEPP envelope was calibrated to meet two objectives to counter the risks to the mediumterm inflation outlook due to the pandemic and to prevent market fragmentation and ensure the transmission of our policy to the entire euro area.,True,warfare,True,False
When the time comes we will reduce our asset purchases depending on the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
We look at inflation over the medium term so if there is a sudden increase in prices but it is a oneoff event it will not affect our decisionmaking.,True,other,True,True
The aim of all our decisions is to bring inflation closer to a level of below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
So even if inflation were to increase we would not raise interest rates immediately if doing so would tip the economy into a recession.,True,orientation,True,True
We are going to be very attentive to the economic developments to the many numbers that are popping up whether it's PMI whether it's services whether it's employment whether it's inflation and the like of it to make sure that our tools are properly calibrated and can respond adequately to the current situation.,True,machine,True,True
Clearly inflation inflation components measurements price stability definition will be under review.,True,other,True,True
That's a really difficult question because we are seeing disinflationary forces at the moment.,True,warfare,True,True
I think there are many economists who argue that there is more of that and potential deflationary risk.,True,disease,True,True
But I'd rather talk about disinflationary forces in the short term and then total uncertainty as to the mediumtolonger term.,True,warfare,True,True
Now how these economic forces how this economic transition how the digitisation of the economy how the greening of our economies will impact prices and the measurement of inflation is going to be a major determinant of what inflation will look like going forward.,True,other,True,True
But it may well be inflationary in the longer term.,True,other,True,True
The first objective of the PEPP is to counter the risks to the inflation outlook over the medium term which is being dampened by the crisis.,True,liquids,True,True
Even in our severe scenario we didnt really have inflation going negative.,True,orientation,True,True
The risk of negative inflation is there but in our scenarios inflation will remain quite low while remaining in positive territory.,True,orientation,True,True
Its good news that the inflation numbers coming out are better than expected.,True,other,True,True
But going back to my first point its good but it doesnt tell you all that much about inflation in the medium term.,True,other,True,True
Do we have evidence that monetary policy affects inflation?,True,other,True,False
Our policies over the last several years have had a significant effect on the inflation rate.,True,other,True,True
In the absence of the measures taken by the ECB especially since 2014 we would be in a situation of much lower inflation maybe even negative inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Remember Japan spent about 15 years with negative inflation.,True,orientation,True,False
First stabilising inflation at around 1 should not be discounted as a minor achievement.,True,other,True,True
But second its quite important to continue to push inflation closer to 2 and the pandemic illustrates why this is important.,True,orientation,True,True
The European economy would be a lot safer and our ability to deal with this type of shock would be much more enhanced if we had an inflation rate closer to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB has consistently said that this process of returning inflation to levels that are closer to 2 takes patience because we cant make dramatic monetary policy moves.,True,orientation,True,True
If the European economy has a low desire for investment compared to a high desire for savings then the European economy can only have something reasonably approximating full employment and a path of inflation back to levels closer to our inflation aim if the rate the ECB sets is below the equilibrium rate.,True,orientation,True,False
If instead we were to raise the interest rate when its not warranted it would lead to a lower inflation rate and we would see an even longer period of very low interest rates.,True,orientation,True,True
We said what the exit strategy is from the APP and from negative interest rates which is inflation robustly converging to our inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
The question you are posing in essence says that the European economy cannot grow sufficiently quickly and inflationary pressures are not going to be that strong so long as debt is at a certain level.,True,other,True,True
Because were both looking at the inflation data the hard data.,True,other,True,True
This is significantly lower than our inflation target of just under two percent.,False,,True,False
We are therefore buying more bonds in order to promote economic growth achieve our inflation target and prevent fragmentation in the euro area a too strong tightening of financing conditions in euro area countries.,True,warfare,True,True
Against this big drop in GDP and inflation we had to act.,True,orientation,True,True
But yes in the context of the strategy review we will be looking at the inflation target.,False,,True,False
Eurostat calculates inflation for the euro area on the basis of data from each country.,False,,False,False
This measurement of inflation is considered appropriate.,False,,True,False
Please do not forget that in the present juncture as in 2015 and 2016 we have deflationary pressures that we have to deter.,True,warfare,True,True
So you can see that we can get out if the economic conditions and inflation data allow it.,True,orientation,True,True
But if the situation improves and the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level which is in line with our mandate we can return to exit mode.,True,orientation,True,True
I see no reason why inflation shouldn't increase again.,True,orientation,True,True
But deglobalisation and the disruption of global value chains could also be pushing inflation up.,True,orientation,True,True
So we need forceful measures to avoid the tightening of credit conditions stabilise the economy and thus respond to inflation moving further away from our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
We have shown that we are ready to take all the necessary measures to reach our inflation objective and we are still guided by this aim.,True,orientation,True,True
Based on the inflation outlook I expect a prolonged period of very accommodative monetary policy to fulfil our mandate.,True,orientation,True,True
And depending on economic conditions and our inflation projections we are always open to recalibrating the programme.,True,machine,True,True
To decide on the appropriateness and proportionality of the programme the ECB takes into account inflation expectations which are now lower than before the pandemic and financial conditions.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB focuses on its inflation aim and on ensuring that there isnt a tightening of financial conditions because that would have very negative consequences and we must prevent any fragmentation in the bond markets.,True,disease,True,True
At the ECB as Ive already said our actions are guided by our inflation aim of below but close to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
The current projections show inflation at 1.3 in 2022 so we are still a long way from the aim and our stimulus measures are necessary.,True,orientation,True,True
Now we want to make sure that stability stays but also that financial conditions are sufficiently accommodative to support the economic recovery and counter the substantial negative shock to the inflation trajectory.,True,warfare,True,True
Before the pandemic the ECB had been on a sustained mission since 2015 to strengthen inflation and to bring it closer to the Governing Councils inflation aim.,True,warfare,True,True
Then the pandemic arrived and our projections indicate that this shock is having a significant negative impact on inflation.,True,disease,True,True
However even after the coronavirus crisis phase is over inflation will still be far from our inflation aim so the APP will still be needed.,True,orientation,True,True
By the way the horizon of the APP is openended in a statecontingent fashion the horizon for APP asset purchases is conditional on the ECBs Governing Council seeing a robust convergence of inflation to our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
Right now these forces are putting downward pressure on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Central banks globally are fighting against low inflation and are engaged in asset purchases to do that.,True,warfare,True,True
But our central bank actions are motivated by our monetary policy mandate if the inflation outlook changes then central bank policies will adjust as well.,True,orientation,True,True
We do not know where interest rates will be in the future because we do not know where inflation will be in the next three five or ten years.,True,orientation,True,False
Under current circumstances this big negative economic shock is putting downward pressure on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True

The ECB is promoting the development of a European Capital Markets Union.AskECB Schnabel Theecbs inflation aim of below but close to 2 has served us well for the past 20 years.,False,,False,False
At yesterdays meeting we discussed the new projections for growth and inflation.,False,,True,False
We have seen that the prolonged lockdown of economic activity has hit many euro area countries very hard and has caused deflationary pressures to resurface.,True,disease,True,True
Every three months the ECB publishes its projections for growth and inflation in the euro area over the following two years.,False,,True,True
But I am concerned that especially in Germany these narratives of the expropriation of savers punitive interest rates a glut of liquidity threatening inflation and zombie firms have developed and taken hold despite numerous facts in support of another perspective.,True,disease,True,True
That is the rate that emerges when all factors of production are at full capacity and exert no inflationary pressure.,True,machine,True,True
That is why central banks including the ECB generally turn to unconventional measures when shortterm interest rates are at very low levels especially as extremely low and in part even negative rates of inflation began to appear in the euro area as of 2014.,True,orientation,True,True
Therefore it is clear for us that we can and have to continue our monetary policy in line with our mandate to make sure that in the medium term we are getting back to our inflation aim of below but close to 2 per cent and that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
For example if anything inflation has been too low in the past years while originally the German fear had been that inflation would be too high.,True,orientation,True,True
One number that is of course of particular interest is the evolution of the mediumterm inflation outlook.,True,plant,True,True
In the short run there are quite a few disinflationary forces.,True,warfare,True,True
Falling energy prices have already depressed inflation a lot.,True,orientation,True,True
The mediumterm inflation outlook will likely also be challenging but is much more uncertain because there are countervailing forces.,True,warfare,True,True
Price stability is at the heart of our mandate with inflation of below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
In a situation like the one we are facing with inflation currently below and projected to fall short of the objective in the coming years and the economy in deep contraction the ECB has to ensure as much accommodation as needed to stabilise inflation and the economy.,True,orientation,True,True
It is important to recognise that inflation has been very low and we have had to implement expansionary monetary policy measures to lift it to levels that are closer to our inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
Its clearly a disinflationary environment.,True,other,True,True
We will do everything that is necessary to secure price stability in line with our mandate and avoid disinflationary or even deflationary risks.,True,warfare,True,True
We think that inflation will stay very low for the next two or three years well below our definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
I cant say what will happen in ten years but I note that marketbased indicators of longerterm inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels.,True,orientation,True,True
First it grants a safety margin to deflationary territory also taking into account possible crosscountry differences in the price level.,True,orientation,True,True
And its extremely hard and extremely expensive to find a way out of a deflationary situation.,True,orientation,True,True
Moreover there is a possibility of distortion when measuring inflation as price pressures can also reflect improvements in product quality which means that measured inflation is always somewhat higher than actual inflation.,True,other,True,True
So on the monetary policy side we will need to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.,True,orientation,True,True
As that entails an excess in saving and less potential for innovation many economists refer to a secular stagnation economic growth slows down also lowering inflation and interest rates because there is less demand for capital.,True,orientation,True,True
The latter came about because inflation was falling short of our objective.,True,orientation,True,True
When we started the asset purchase programme in 2015 there was a risk of deflation.,True,disease,True,True
Our first step was to ensure that inflation did not enter into a downward spiral.,True,orientation,True,True
We only buy a monthly amount that is fixed in advance and we will stop as soon as the inflation aim is reached.,True,orientation,True,True
The main goal was to reduce inflation and change the income policy.,True,other,True,True
The second question was about inflation.,True,other,True,True
This posed downside risks to the inflation outlook in the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
Our existing asset purchase programme APP was designed for normal times providing monetary policy accommodation in order to support the gradual return of inflation to our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
Monetary policy is a very powerful tool for influencing the financial markets the process of creating credit to the economy consumption and investment decisions job creation and inflation.,True,machine,True,True
And we do see inflation moving upwards.,True,orientation,True,True
Without these policies these disinflationary pressures would be more severe.,True,other,True,True
We would not only have lower inflation we could even have the risk of deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Going back to your question about Japan all of this is very much with the intent of avoiding the situation of deflation that Japan had from the mid1990s to about 2013.,True,other,True,True
That was a very costly episode to have and we are intent on making sure inflation goes back to target in order to avoid that situation.,True,orientation,True,True
If inflation gets worse if it gets lower if it gets locked in at a low rate then the prospects for interest rates recovering in the future would be less.,True,orientation,True,True
The real interest rate that is the interest rate adjusted for inflation emerges from the economys growth potential in the long run.,True,plant,True,True
If it wishes to fulfil its mandate and stimulate the economy at a time when inflation is too low it has to lower interest rates even further.,True,orientation,True,True
They found that economic growth would have been considerably slower inflation would have been lower and unemployment higher.,True,orientation,True,False
Were living in a world in which were going to have low inflation low real interest rates low economic growth and if the situation isnt resolved low productivity.,True,orientation,True,True
When the ECB was created at the end of the 1990s and the objective was to keep inflation below 2 it was because deflation wasnt a concern.,True,orientation,True,True
The reason why the answer now is a little different to two years ago is that there is some evidence of a recovery in inflation.,True,disease,True,True
Two or three years ago there was a lot of debate about missing wage inflation.,True,other,True,True
But after a long period of time we have had wage inflation now for a couple of years.,True,other,True,True
When you look at price inflation you see a variation.,True,other,True,True
Services inflation is in the high ones now so it's not the case that services inflation is dead.,True,disease,True,True
The big gap is in goods inflation.,True,other,True,True
The global influences on inflation that come through commodities and goods prices are much less evident in services.,True,other,True,True
The global question is why inflation in the goods category is so much weaker while firms in the goods sector are facing more labour cost pressure.,True,other,True,True
But in the end inflation is a monetary phenomenon.,True,other,True,True
But if a central bank is doing its job it is probably not a useful approach to say that these factors permanently affect the inflation rate.,True,other,True,True
I think that ultimately has mixed effects on the inflation dynamics.,True,machine,True,True
But I wouldn't classify it all as working in one direction in terms of inflationary pressure.,True,orientation,True,True
So it is changing the structure in some categories but we do not think that it is something that is so fundamental that the monetary drivers of inflation are somehow disconnected.,True,machine,True,True
But I am not so sure you can say that the overall inflation rate in the economy is permanently affected.,True,other,True,True
We know countries where the monetary forces are a lot looser and there is no problem with inflation getting high.,True,orientation,True,True
When you are in this kind of low zone where the advanced economies and many emerging markets are where inflation is super low and interest rates and our policy instruments are already quite extended then a negative shock to inflation is going to be more visible because we cannot instantly correct it.,True,orientation,True,True
The policy space is such that it takes time to restore inflation back to target when you have a low inflation and a low interest rate world with relatively small temporary shocks to inflation which are more visible and more persistent.,True,orientation,True,True
First of all low inflation means a small shock compared to the overall inflation rate looks bigger and second our ability to quickly eliminate those shocks is less.,True,orientation,True,True
Since 2014 the mantra of the ECB has been patience that we are intent on getting inflation back to target.,True,orientation,True,True
In those countries with stronger economies you might expect to see inflation stronger and the labour market tighter.,True,orientation,True,True
This is why in the end we do look at the aggregate because the economics of appreciation and depreciation are that if you live in a country which persistently has inflation above the euro area aggregate all else equal it basically means a loss of competitiveness.,True,other,True,True
Equally a country where inflation is below the average over time would gain competitiveness and will climb.,True,orientation,True,True
Those differentials play a very important role but it is not fundamentally an inflation issue it is a relative price level issue.,True,other,True,True
If you go back long enough there are definitely periods of time when price level inflation was very low but by and large in many of those cases that was a period when you had the gold standard or Bretton Woods and so on.,True,other,True,True
Equally under the gold standard the responsibility for inflation at national level was quite different.,True,other,True,True
At that level we understand that you can have periods of very low interest rates and very low inflation rates.,True,other,True,True
But in terms of the history of modern central banking there isnt such a clear parallel because you had the inflationary pressures in the 1970s and the 1980s and then the disinflation and then the convergence to around 2 in the late 1990s early 2000s.,True,orientation,True,True
What is different is that getting inflation back to target from below is something where the playbook is quite different to getting inflation back to target from above.,True,orientation,True,True
The motivation was to rule out deflation.,True,other,True,True
There were signs of inflation dynamics approaching zero or even going negative.,True,orientation,True,True
Phase 1 of the ECBs pivot was to address that to restore enough inflationary pressures that we would be back into sustainably positive inflation territory.,True,orientation,True,True
Then phase 2 which has been a number of years now not being satisfied with eliminating deflation risk but wanting to bring inflation back towards the target.,True,orientation,True,True
The scale of excess in unemployment across Europe was so high that it took a while even for wage inflation to pick up.,True,other,True,True
We have persistent wage inflation now.,True,other,True,True
Already we see it in services inflation we think we will have it in goods inflation as well.,True,other,True,True
That is a scenario by which inflation will climb over time.,True,orientation,True,True
The contest is between that and the fact we also know inflation is very persistent.,True,sports,True,True
So if you are in a situation where firms and workers have spent several years in a world where inflation has been around 1 then that kind of model influences their expectation of what is going to happen next year and the year after and the year after that.,True,other,True,True
In other words if inflation is low and there is a belief that it will remain low then the incentives to raise prices come down.,True,orientation,True,True
The ask when inflation is unexpectedly low is less than when inflation is high.,True,orientation,True,True
Theres definitely a kind of selfreinforcing nature of inflation.,True,machine,True,True
Thats true at high inflation its true at low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
It is likely that inflation is going to move up slowly and that has been our forecast.,True,orientation,True,True
The central bank has to be sufficiently proactive in policymaking that people understand that inflation is going to rise over time.,True,orientation,True,True
If you are indifferent if you ignore the importance of getting inflation up over time then you can get locked into a kind of low inflation trap.,True,orientation,True,True
So inflation is moving up.,True,orientation,True,True
The twoyearahead inflation forecast had come down from 1.8 at the end of 2018 to 1.5 by September 2019.,True,orientation,True,True
When I talk about the inflation projection it is basically aggregating everything in our macro models.,True,other,True,True
But we also know especially in the world of very low inflation those factors are not directly controlled by the central bank.,True,other,True,True
In the end I share the view of many that the most important influence on expectations is actual inflation.,True,other,True,True
Unless we get actual inflation up we can talk as much as we like and communicate as much as we like but in the absence of evidence that inflation is moving up then many people will ignore the central banks communication.,True,orientation,True,True
If you knew for sure inflation was going to be 1.0 forever 1.5 forever 2.0 forever then I would agree with you it doesnt really matter.,True,other,True,True
The policy space when inflation is 2 means if theres a negative shock we basically have 200 basis points of cutting before getting to zero compared to 100 basis points if the inflation rate were 1.,True,orientation,True,True
There is a universal consensus that you really dont want to get into a situation where a negative shock can drive you into deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Our ability to use the traditional policy tool which is a positive policy rate is bigger if the inflation rate is 2 than if the inflation rate is 1 or zero.,True,machine,True,True
Even before you get to housing there are huge differences in the inflation rates facing individuals.,True,other,True,True
Depending where you are in terms of your point in life young versus old depending on whether youre in a country where youre renting versus where you are owneroccupied depending whether you are in a country where house prices are falling like in Italy versus where house prices are going up like in northern Europe theres going to be a lot of variation in individual inflation rates.,True,other,True,True
For example at one of our recent meetings I was looking at what the inflation rate would look like if we included a measure of owneroccupied housing in the index.,True,other,True,False
The inflation rate would be a little bit higher now.,True,other,True,True
Housing is quite cyclical so in a downturn the inflation rate would fall more quickly because if you have a negative shock if you look at the proxy measures that are being generated they do fall more quickly in a recession.,True,orientation,True,True
This goes back to the issue of inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
If you do not provide stimulus that gets inflation back towards the target if inflation remains low for a longer and longer period of time and then if you have a negative shock you run the risk of being in a situation where essentially you hit the limits of monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
Swedens inflation rate is closer to target than the ECBs inflation rate is.,True,orientation,True,True
It is a lot easier to make that decision when inflation is closer to 2 percent as in Sweden than when it is still too far away as it is here.,True,orientation,True,True
Broadly speaking if we were to have the same fiscal policy as the United States then yes inflation would be a lot higher.,True,other,True,True
The fact that we have this global low inflation environment also means if there is a turn there could be a global turn in a synchronised way.,True,orientation,True,True
I think there are downside risks and while I would not like to call the forces that raise inflation upside risks because they may be bad news for the global economy like deglobalisation.,True,orientation,True,True
But there could be forces that are inflationary that could kick in trade and geopolitical forces.,True,orientation,True,True
That could be a force that contributes to inflation dynamics.,True,machine,True,True
I think my job as President is to facilitate the expression the rallying of views around various themes one of which will be the inflation objectivesetting if you will which may take multiple forms but which is one of the anchors that will determine our discussions.,True,other,True,True
The growth was much higher in those days inflation was higher the prospects for the various demographics around the world were different.,True,orientation,True,True
Every six weeks we all get together we look at the numbers we look at the markets we look at the views of the citizens in terms of inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
Both rates need to be seen in parallel the rate of return and the rate of inflation.,False,,True,False
Because the central banks mandate is to preserve price stability and in particular to prevent us from slipping into deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
It makes sense to use all of the tools at our disposal when it comes to increasing growth which will also result in inflation moving towards levels close to 2.There are three elements to this policy mix monetary policy which has continuously been used to maintain price stability fiscal policy which should be used more often in order to support monetary policy in Member States where possible and structural reforms to increase the growth potential within our economies.,True,machine,True,True
Indeed since the introduction of the euro annual inflation has averaged around 1.7 in the euro area.,True,other,True,True
However inflation currently stands at 1 and inflation projections are still low at some distance from the level of below but close to 2 that we would like to reach over the mediumterm.,True,orientation,True,True
What effects do climaterelated risks have on our growth and inflation projections?,False,,True,False
In spring 2014 just before the rate on the deposit facility was reduced into negative territory lending to the real economy was declining with all that that entailed such as the risk of an economic downturn and deflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We know that inflation is going to be elevated for a certain period of time but also that its going to decline over the course of next year.,True,orientation,True,True
Most economists hadnt expected the extent of the increase in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We are well aware of the uncertainty around our inflation projections.,True,other,True,True
Are we going to go back to the disinflationary environment that we had before the pandemic?,False,,True,False
Or are we entering a new phase that may be characterised by inflationary rather than disinflationary shocks?,False,,False,False
We should follow a risk management approach so that we can quickly respond should we see signs that inflation will stay more permanently at a level above our 2 target.,True,orientation,True,True
The reason why our policies have been accommodative for so long is that inflation was stubbornly low.,True,orientation,True,True
Despite all the measures we have taken it has been hard to get mediumterm inflation back towards the 2 target.,True,orientation,True,True
Before the pandemic we were in an environment of relatively low growth and too low inflation for many years.,True,orientation,True,True
But now we are seeing that inflation is picking up and inflation expectations are realigning with our target of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
This is precisely what can help us get out of the low growth low inflation environment and back to a more normal world.,True,orientation,True,True
Yes I think that the inflation we are experiencing today comes essentially from passing phenomena.,True,other,True,True
So when these base effects disappear inflation will slow down.,True,machine,True,True
First of all it should be noted that all the central banks in the world have defined price stability as being inflation at around 2.,True,other,True,True
In Europe we decided that we had to be clear precise and we said that the inflation target was 2.,True,other,True,True
As you mentioned Germany has a higher rate of inflation than Italy at the moment.,True,orientation,True,True
What is certain is that the factors behind the high rate of inflation were experiencing will not last and we should see them fade next year.,True,disease,True,True
But what Id first like to draw attention to is that we underestimated inflation developments in 2021.,True,other,True,True
The European Commission published its economic projections two weeks ago and revised inflation figures upwards.,True,orientation,True,True
As a result theres a risk that inflation will not go down as quickly and as much as we predicted.,True,orientation,True,True
Amid the current uncertainty its crucial to look at inflation expectations to see what level they will settle at.,True,other,True,True
For the time being theyre a little below our inflation target of 2 which is largely reassuring.,True,orientation,True,True
In that case the upward inflationary trend could be more longlasting.,True,orientation,True,True
What we will do is adjust our pandemic emergency purchase programme PEPP to the dynamics of inflation to our economic forecasts and to the changing health situation.,True,machine,True,True
We must therefore keep our monetary policy accommodative although not to the extent that we did at the height of the crisis in order to meet our mediumterm inflation objective and be even more driven by economic data.,True,orientation,True,True
29 November 2021 I can see why many people are currently worried about very high inflation rates.,True,orientation,True,True
There are also oneoff statistical effects at play inflation rates are high now because prices were exceptionally low a year ago.,True,orientation,True,True
But if we look at the comparison with the prices before the pandemic so over the past two years the average inflation rate for Germany is only around 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But we believe that the inflation rate will peak in November and gradually subside next year towards our inflation target of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Indeed most forecasts expect inflation to fall even below that 2 level.,True,orientation,True,True
So there is no indication that inflation is getting out of control.,True,disease,True,True
That means that inflation developments will not continue at the same pace.,True,machine,True,True
So if we see that inflation could persistently remain at a level above 2 we will of course respond decisively.,True,warfare,True,True
That would essentially result in higher unemployment and would not have any impact on the current extremely high rate of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And not only because our primary objective is maintaining price stability and inflation is a crucial indicator of that.,False,,True,False
But also because we know that inflation affects people.,False,,True,True
Those who are less privileged and less well off are the ones who suffer the most from inflation.,False,,False,False
After all energy price inflation now accounts for around half of the high inflation rates.,True,other,True,True
That stands out at the moment and is making many people worried but we expect that this rise in inflation will not last.,True,orientation,True,True
We expect that the inflation rates will start to fall from as early as January.,True,orientation,True,True
Judging by what we know from surveys of employers and trade unions so far no strong inflationary pressure is to be expected from that front for the time being.,True,fire,True,True
And if we look at inflation expectations both those which can be derived from the financial markets and those resulting from surveys then most people do not expect higher inflation in the longer term.,True,orientation,True,True
Inflation expectations have risen but they are below our inflation target of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We dont see any deanchoring of inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
To answer it you have to consider what is driving the current high rates of inflation.,True,machine,False,False
Yes I understand these concerns very well inflation in Germany is higher than in some other countries in Italy or France for example.,True,orientation,True,True
In addition there are cultural differences and a special history with inflation in Germany in the 1920s.,True,other,True,True
The collective experience of inflation in Germany is a different one to that of France or Italy.,True,other,True,True
According to our forecasts however inflation would have fallen back again by then.,True,orientation,True,True
We would cause unemployment and high adjustment costs and would nonetheless not have countered the current high level of inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
It goes without saying that we think about longerterm inflation developments.,True,other,True,True
The issue is whether factors which have so far dampened inflation such as demographic developments or globalisation are now reversing and could lead to higher rates of inflation.,True,fire,True,True
Globalisation will change but it will proceed and will in all likelihood continue to temper inflation.,True,fire,True,True
By contrast in my estimation the changes in demographic developments could have an impact on the future path of inflation as indeed could digitalisation.,True,orientation,True,True
But all in all I see factors that will suppress inflation in the longer term rather than factors that will drive it up.,True,fire,True,True
In recent quarters we have had to gradually adjust our inflation forecasts.,True,machine,True,True
When we see inflation reaching our two per cent target over the medium term durably and sustainably meaning not just for a short period of time then the interest rates can rise again.,True,orientation,True,True
Part of that is the mediumterm symmetrical inflation target of two per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
I would say the general trends remain intact which means that compared with our September projections I would expect higher inflation numbers going forward mainly due to the fact that the supply chain disruptions are more persistent than we had initially thought.,True,other,True,True
I expect our staffs inflation projections to be revised upwards for next year but I still think and most people would agree that inflation is going to decline over the course of next year.,True,orientation,True,True
It's plausible to assume that inflation is going to drop below our target of 2 in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
However the risks to inflation are skewed to the upside.,True,orientation,True,True
What makes it plausible that inflation is going to drop below 2 again is that the disinflationary forces that we were facing before the pandemic may still be there.,True,warfare,True,True
But it matters how long such disruptions persist because this may have an effect on inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
This matters greatly for us because rising inflation expectations would have ripple effects on the economy and may then have an effect on wages and inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
What we're seeing at the moment is that longterm inflation expectations have started to realign with our 2 target.,True,orientation,True,True
There is also no sign that inflation expectations are deanchored to the upside.,True,machine,True,True
But this hinges on the expectation that if we found that there were very strong inflation dynamics threatening to deanchor inflation expectations to the upside we would react to that.,True,orientation,True,True
Given our symmetric inflation target it's just as important that we react to a potential deanchoring to the upside.,True,orientation,True,True
If we see that the inflation outlook improves so that the conditions of our forward guidance are fulfilled there is a natural reason to act on that.,True,orientation,True,True
The situation now is different because we do not see the mediumterm inflation outlook above 2.,True,orientation,True,True
I think it was rather a reflection of the uncertainty about the inflation outlook itself.,True,other,True,True
There was and remains a certain divergence between ECB staff projections and what markets are expecting on inflation.,True,other,True,True
The main criterion is the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
We always said that the PEPP had the role to counter the negative effect of the pandemic on the inflation outlook.,True,warfare,True,True
We have to make a judgement on whether what we are seeing now in some Member States is going to fundamentally change the inflation outlook and at the moment I don't see that.,True,other,False,False
This is closely related to what we just discussed how do we see the inflation outlook and how likely is it that we're going to get back in a durable fashion to our inflation target of 2 over the medium term?,False,,False,False
We have to ask ourselves what is the overall desired monetary policy stance in light of the inflation outlook taking into account the measures that are already in place?,False,,True,False
We need to allow the data to come in so that we can get more clarity about what is going to happen after the unusual movements in inflation that we've seen this year and that we're also going to see next year.,True,other,True,True
In the context of rising inflation new narratives appear.,True,other,True,True
However if you look at the entire discourse about inflation in Germany and in other countries I do think it has become more differentiated.,True,other,True,True
There are now quite a few newspapers trying to explain these very unusual inflation dynamics without creating a sense of panic.,True,disease,True,True
The debate about inflation is very important.,True,other,True,True
We've just published an explainer on inflation on our website which tries to deal with some of the current concerns.,True,other,True,True
And if we look at the situation over the medium term the inflation rate is still too low below our 2 per cent target not too high.,False,,True,True
The currently high inflation is linked to the fact that the recovery has been strong at the global level.,True,other,True,True
So yes we did talk about inflation inflation inflation but this period of inflation is very unusual and temporary and not a sign of a chronic situation.,True,disease,True,True
In recent decades we have seen that wage increases at the euro area level have not been high enough to generate inflation of 2 per cent.,False,,True,False
We will look out for unsustainable patterns that might lead to pressures that are undesirable from an inflation perspective.,True,other,True,True
Since the global financial crisis inflation in Europe has been well below the 2 per cent target.,True,orientation,True,True
The United States and the United Kingdom however are facing a greater risk of inflation rising above that level over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
We are driven by the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
Things have picked up faster and that is true for growth that is true for inflation and that is true for employment.,True,orientation,True,True
They have of course moved up and the difference is explaining a lot of the inflation that unfortunately people are experiencing at the moment.,True,orientation,True,True
We hope it will happen and as we close that gap clearly the economic activity will continue to be stimulated and we will see movement on the inflation front.,True,orientation,True,True
We look at the inflation outlook and we determine how much monetary support is needed and that helps us calibrate the purchases that we believe are necessary which is why we calibrated and decided to purchase moderately in the coming quarter.,True,machine,True,True
Because that's our job price stability is defined under our new strategy review by reference to the 2 inflation mark which is identified over a period of time because we are not going to respond abruptly we are not going to trust one number.,True,other,True,True
But of course we believe that if our monetary policy is successful we will indeed hit the 2 inflation.,True,sports,True,True
No it's not over the whole projection horizon what we say is that we want to see inflation at that 2 level say midway during the projection period and lasting all the way to the end of our horizon.,True,orientation,True,True
My hunch from having read some of those is that it's likely to be pushing prices up for a short period of time and probably later on might have some deflationary impact.,True,orientation,True,True
17 September 2021 I fully understand that many people are complaining about the low interest rates but you cant look at purchasing power purely in terms of inflation De Guindos says.,False,,False,False
Within the ECB de Guindos is neither seen as a dove nor a hawk meaning that he has no pronounced preference for stimulating economic growth rather than keeping inflation in check.,False,,True,True
The target is symmetric in the sense that negative and positive deviations of inflation from the target are equally undesirable.,False,,False,False
It must be crystal clear that our primary and ultimate aim is price stability and so our focus is on the path of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We expect inflation to continue accelerating until November this year and then fall to 1.7 in 2022 and 1.5 the year after.,True,machine,True,True
We are also on this medium term which matters most because we are particularly concerned about inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
All of that is going to have an impact on prices hence on inflation hence on price stability.,True,other,True,True
There are some traditional thinkers who believe that central banks should altogether stay out of that business and exclusively concentrate on inflation and price stability.,True,other,True,True
Future monetary policy decisions will essentially depend on how the economy and inflation develop in the coming months.,True,plant,True,True
The monetary policy measures were intended to limit the impact of the pandemic on the economy maintain favourable financing conditions and ensure we met our inflation target.,True,warfare,True,True
If inflation and the economy recover then there will logically be a gradual normalisation of monetary policy and of fiscal policy too.,True,disease,True,True
We should monitor economic developments inflation and economic projections.,True,other,True,True
We have changed the definition of price stability but that doesnt mean that in general we will accept a much higher rate of inflation.,True,other,True,True
The inflation target is now 2 over the medium term and not below but close to 2 as it was before.,True,other,True,True
This is important because up until now the perception was that the ECB acted more forcefully when inflation overshot the target.,True,warfare,True,True
But were not like the Federal Reserve System and we dont accept inflation compensation.,True,other,True,True
What we have said is that inflation can be temporarily and moderately higher than 2 because current interest rates are zero or close to zero.,True,other,True,False
But that does not mean that in general we have raised our level of acceptance of high inflation.,True,other,True,True
Favourability is defined by whether financing conditions are sufficiently favourable to make sure were countering the negative pandemic shock to inflation.,False,,False,False
Well have to assess at the September meeting the appropriate calibration for the final quarter of the year taking into account the movement in market interest rates and the inflation outlook.,False,,False,False
Our tolerance for the level of financing conditions depends on how robust the inflation dynamic is looking.,False,,True,False
Over the course of the year since the bottom seen last year one narrative a kind of pessimism that inflation was locked into a very low trajectory has been repriced.,True,orientation,True,True
Over the summer youve also seen a narrative that a new chronically high inflation era is coming.,True,orientation,True,True
We need to observe whether the inflation readings were seeing right now will influence wage negotiations.,False,,True,False
In 2020 inflation came in at 0.3. In June we predicted that 2021 inflation would be 1.9. If you put those together you have an average of 1.1. Thats broadly where inflation was prepandemic.,False,,False,False
By and large thats true our view of subdued inflation pressures for the medium term still holds but my first point also applies.,False,,True,False
It does serve to remind everyone that this type of fatalism that inflation will always be very low is being given less weight in markets.,True,orientation,True,True
But equally the kind of speculation that we are entering a chronically high inflation period is also seen as less likely.,True,orientation,True,True
One in relation to the two per cent symmetric inflation target what we decided is not a really huge surprise given the discussion in the last several years.,False,,False,False
But it is also true that as inflation goes up in the coming years the rate forward guidance will provide discipline and strong guidance about our patience.,False,,True,True
Its going to play an important role in ruling out speculation that as the inflation environment improves we might be tempted into premature tightening.,False,,True,True
But at some point well enter that zone where inflation is rising and its moving closer to two per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
To support these kinds of policy choices for example the rate forward guidance we would run all sorts of simulations to assess what inflation would look like under various configurations of the economy.,False,,True,False
And the intention here is to deliver the two per cent inflation target.,False,,True,False
But if you keep with the rate forward guidance it may imply a transitory period of inflation above two per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
But to acknowledge that two per cent in the medium term may involve a transitory phase of inflation moderately above two per cent should be basically viewed in a matter of fact manner.,True,orientation,True,True
Whenever PEPP ends and we rely on APP as the primary QE instrument the driver of policy will be the gap between where inflation is projected and our mediumterm two per cent target.,True,machine,True,True
For example it exposes the economy to more frequent macroeconomic shocks which has an impact on growth and inflation.,False,,False,False
Nonetheless its not certain that climate change and the transition to a climateneutral economy lead to higher inflation.,False,,True,False
Nevertheless a gradual increase in carbon prices may well lead to higher inflation rates in the coming years.,False,,False,False
We are faced with a very unusual situation and the current high inflation figures are largely due to transitory effects.,False,,True,False
At the beginning of the pandemic inflation decreased significantly starting with the first lockdown.,False,,False,False
Energy prices are rising the VAT rate has gone back to its original level and all of that automatically pushes inflation much higher.,True,orientation,True,True
In part this is simply because the high prices of today are set against the very low prices of last year the inflation rate always shows the change in consumer prices yearonyear.,True,orientation,True,True
While we expect inflation to continue rising until the end of this year especially in Germany our estimate is that it will fall significantly as of next year.,True,orientation,True,True
Thats right because monetary policy looks at inflation developments in the medium term.,True,plant,True,True
And on that horizon we expect inflation in the euro area to be below our target of two per cent.,False,,True,True
As surprising as it may sound to some we are more worried about the inflation rate being too low in the medium term rather than too high.,False,,True,True
Increased demand on the back of higher real wages would bring us closer to our inflation target which we have been falling short of for years and help us escape the low interest rate environment.,True,orientation,True,True
Some had seen it as a ceiling assuming that while inflation must not exceed it undershooting it would not be a problem.,True,orientation,True,True
And it is symmetric meaning that too low inflation is considered equally undesirable as too high inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
If the recovery takes hold if we go back to prepandemic output level growth is back to potential and inflation reaches our target of 2 per cent then we should start to normalise our monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
Without this joint effort of monetary and fiscal policy we would be in a much worse place today in terms of inflation growth and employment.,True,orientation,True,True
We agreed with a large majority to increase interest rates when we see inflation reaching our 2 per cent target well ahead of the end of our projection horizon and durably at least for the rest of the projection horizon which presently stretches until 2023.,True,orientation,True,True
We also need to see a realised progress in underlying inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
While we are currently seeing inflation rates of close to 2 per cent in the euro area we are expecting them to fall next year and remain in those levels after.,True,orientation,True,True
The PEPP should end when the emergency is over and its dampening effect on inflation disappears.,True,disease,True,True
Over there the inflation rate is well above 5 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
Next year the pace of inflation will slow down again when a number of oneoff effects such as the temporary VAT cut in Germany in 2020 disappear.,True,orientation,True,True
This is because temporary inflation must not be allowed to become structural inflation.,True,disease,True,True
29 July 2021 The risks of an incomplete recovery are still high while the risks of the economy overheating and high inflation are still contained.,True,fire,True,True
It didnt work we ended up with stagnant demand a sluggish recovery and a long period of dangerously low inflation.,True,disease,True,True
We have clarified that we want an inflation rate in the medium term of 2 not below 2.,True,other,True,True
A rate of inflation of 1.4 or 1.5 like we currently have in our projections is unsatisfactory.,True,other,True,True
We have also clarified that a 2 rate of inflation is not an ultimate limit if it helps to anchor expectations and makes the 2 target credible then we can temporarily go slightly above it.,True,other,True,True
Because inflation has been below 2 for so long we need values of above 2 to pursue our target symmetrically.,True,other,True,True
A toolow inflation target can put excessive downward pressure on interest rates and hinder central bank efforts to support the economy.,True,orientation,True,True
The new formulation in the strategy should remove the misconceptions generated by the previous definition of inflation as below but close to 2 which led people to believe that the ECB wanted to stay well below 2 and that it was ready to intervene as soon as there was a risk that price dynamics might overshoot that threshold.,True,other,True,True
Above all we will respond forcefully to negative shocks that can push inflation below our target.,True,warfare,True,True
For cinemalovers from now on when inflation falls below 2 our monetary policy should take inspiration from Pirates of the Caribbean even if some would prefer Sleeping Beauty.,True,other,True,True
When price dynamics approach 2 well be patient however we will only raise rates when were convinced that inflation can be firmly anchored at 2 in the medium term according to a series of parameters which are clearly set out in the new forward guidance for both expected and actual inflation.,True,other,True,True
The ECB is a very important institution in terms of the economys development and particularly for the path of inflation.,True,other,True,True
If the ECB lets it be known that it is willing to accept very low inflation then market participants will take this into account.,True,other,True,True
The ECBs inflation target influences inflation expectations and as a result actual inflation.,True,other,True,True
The forward guidance renders these rules operational and indicates how we will react if the Delta variant delays the return of inflation to 2.,True,other,True,True
In the past impatience led the ECB to raise rates prematurely keeping excessive downward pressure on inflation and stymying growth.,True,orientation,True,True
Its a way of making our efforts to bring inflation up to 2 credible.,True,orientation,True,True
Its a prerequisite for making full use of the labour resources available and for generating upward pressure on wages that will push inflation up to levels in line with our target.,True,orientation,True,True
These are all transitory factors that will only have a temporary impact on inflation.,True,other,True,True
Consistency between monetary policy and fiscal policy is crucial at the moment with negative interest rates low inflation and weak demand monetary and fiscal policy both have the objective of getting the economy operating at full capacity again.,True,machine,True,True
Consistent monetary and fiscal measures are still needed to stabilise inflation at 2.,True,machine,True,False
On the contrary this would be monetary dominance in that the central bank would actually be using fiscal policy to achieve its inflation target.,True,warfare,True,True
It is solid because it gives us space to manoeuvre our monetary policy it is a wellaccepted measurement of price stability around the world and it limits the welfare cost of too high inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
So that was a real learning experience for all of us I think to understand the Europeans concern about monetary policy what it does what inflation means to them what links there are with unemployment which was a big concern.,True,other,True,True
Why is it not more taken into account in your measurement of inflation?,True,other,True,True
It's being very attentive to the next projection and how both headline core and other indicators of inflation and inflation expectations will be delivering to see that the persistence we have demonstrated is actually moving the needle.,True,machine,True,True
We will include housing prices through alternative indexes into our assessment of overall inflation.,True,other,True,True
For one thing the increase in the inflation target is minimal.,False,,True,False
The new inflation target safeguards our room to manoeuvre and benefits people.,True,warfare,True,True
Our target is symmetric inflation may sometimes be slightly above it or below.,False,,True,False
This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above the target of two percent.,True,orientation,True,True
The Deutsche Bundesbank forecasts that inflation will reach just over four per cent in Germany towards the end of this year but will already fall again significantly next year.,True,orientation,True,True
Our mediumterm inflation projection is subdued only 1.4 per cent in 2023.,True,orientation,True,False
Though that is surrounded by uncertainty I am sure that we will not experience excessively high inflation.,True,disease,True,True
Whether inflation rises sustainably ultimately hinges on whether wages also rise and amplify inflation through secondround effects.,True,machine,True,True
In previous years inflation was too low.,True,orientation,True,True
The global financial crisis the sovereign debt crisis the pandemic all these crises weakened demand and dampened inflation.,True,disease,True,True
That is why it is important to firmly anchor peoples inflation expectations close to our target of two per cent.,True,warfare,True,True
Moderately higher inflation is a sign of a better economic outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
We have to support this with our monetary policy for as long as it takes to achieve our mediumterm inflation target.,True,warfare,True,True
It is clear that we must achieve our mediumterm inflation target in a sustainable manner.,True,orientation,True,True
We care about the things that are important to the people for example house prices which we will account for better in our inflation measure.,True,other,True,True
By ensuring that mediumterm inflation is below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We will see a return to lower rates of inflation as indicated in our projections.,True,orientation,True,True
Our inflation projections for this year are around the 2 mark which is something we havent seen in more than eight years.,True,orientation,True,True
We therefore expect inflation in the medium term to stabilise below our objective We measure price increases using several instruments.,True,orientation,True,True
17 June 2021 I think it's very important to recall that of course the pandemic is global but in the end where the United States is today and where the euro area is are so different both in terms of the stage in the pandemic recovery in terms of the reopening of the economy but also in terms of the wider inflation dynamic and fundamentally there's a few days' difference in these meetings.,False,,False,False
Last week we had an assessment where inflation even if it's a little bit high right now is going to converge back to 1.4 per cent in 2023.,True,orientation,True,True
So a low inflation mediumterm pressure.,True,other,True,True
What's been interesting is that everyone is thinking more generally about inflation these days but when you start to analyse it the conditions under which those famous secondround effects might actually take hold when we may actually see them in the data are really most likely with a very strong labour market.,True,other,True,True
We have no way to influence the inflation rate in the next month two months three months even longer.,True,other,True,True
When we know that the dominant sources of highinflation readings are transitory factors base effects spikes which are going to reverse we maintain our focus on the medium term.,True,other,True,True
It's in order to offset the negative pandemic shocks to inflation and in terms of implementation we're going to buy flexibly to preserve favourable financing conditions.,True,other,True,True
All of those remain and given that flexible philosophy given the importance of thinking about the inflation outlook given the unpredictability of the pandemic I fully agree with President Lagarde that it's unnecessary and premature to talk about these issues.,True,other,True,True
And given the fact that the inflation outlook remains quite subdued of course it's a multiyear challenge for us.,True,other,True,True
Having the accommodative monetary policy to bring inflation up towards where we want it to be it's not a situation which is going to end very quickly.,True,orientation,True,True
Not always possible but where we can we've been clear in our communication and I think everyone recognises the case for having a clearer expression of our inflation aim.,True,other,True,True
We always talk about inflation anchoring and we are not oblivious to that.,True,other,True,True
From the definition of price stability to the measurement of inflation to the definition of medium term to the relationship between monetary and fiscal policies to climate change impact to communication.,True,other,True,True
So of course we looked at what the Federal Reserve had come out with its average inflation targeting with asymmetric symmetry and focus on employment.,True,other,True,True
For instance if you dont pay attention to climate change how can you assume that you have price stability and that your new definition of inflation is correct?,False,,False,False
And yet youre telling me that inflation is only that.,True,other,True,True
We had very good questions such as Why do you want to pursue this 2 inflation goal Im happy with a zero increase in prices?,False,,True,False
So it certainly told us that we have to better communicate why we need some inflation and that we have to be more explicit and use less jargon than we did and still do actually in our various communication channels.,True,other,True,True
From a monetary policy perspective the main thing to look at is the inflation projection.,False,,True,False
This is the ultimate yardstick against which we measure whether the emergency is over since we said that our tools are meant to offset the negative effect of the pandemic on the inflation outlook.,False,,True,True
Rising yields are a natural development at a turning point in the recovery investors become more optimistic inflation expectations rise and as a result nominal yields go up.,True,plant,True,True
In June were going to look at the drivers of financing conditions we are going to consider additional aspects such as seasonality and well analyse the inflation outlook.,False,,False,False
We always have to be willing to reduce or increase asset purchases in line with our promise to keep euro area financing conditions favourable and to offset the impact of the pandemic on the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
This is an essential element of the PEPP we dont announce in advance a specific volume of purchases that we are going to have every single month rather we assess financing conditions jointly with the inflation outlook and then take a decision based on these data.,False,,False,False
It is not the objective of the PEPP to bring inflation fully back to 2.,False,,True,False
PEPP is designed to counter the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.,False,,True,True
We have other tools to bring inflation back to our aim.,True,machine,True,True
PEPP aims to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
But ultimately getting back to the precrisis inflation path is not enough.,False,,True,False
As things stand today its likely that when the PEPP ends we will not have reached our mediumterm inflation aim of below but close to 2 per cent.,False,,True,False
These drivers directly determine how the exchange rate is affecting mediumterm inflation dynamics and this is what ultimately matters.,False,,False,False
A large part of the volatility of inflation this year will be driven by these factors.,False,,True,False
We see that delivery times have gone up quite substantially the ratio of orders over inventories has gone up and producer price inflation has accelerated.,False,,False,False
It should leave no doubt that we take risks of too low inflation just as seriously as risks of too high inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
It also clarifies that we cannot finetune the inflation process to the first decimal place.,False,,True,False
An open question is whether we should tolerate higher inflation temporarily when we are in a situation in which inflation has been too low for too long as is the case today.,True,orientation,True,True
I would say that our current forward guidance already signals our willingness to do so to a certain degree because we say that we will not raise our policy rates until we see that the robust convergence to our inflation aim has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.,False,,True,True
When it comes to going a step further towards average inflation targeting Im quite sceptical.,False,,True,False
While it may be credible to keep inflation higher for a while when there has been an undershooting the opposite is not so clear because the associated economic cost would be substantial.,True,orientation,True,True
The implementation and communication of average inflation targeting are also quite tricky.,False,,False,False
And while this type of strategy appears attractive when inflation has been too low for an extended period of time it may not fare equally well when the environment changes.,False,,False,False
The output gap the employment gap and the inflation gap are the key variables to determine when we have truly gone beyond the pandemic phase.,False,,False,False
We are currently seeing a transitory increase in inflation driven by rising commodity prices at the global level statistical base effects and the reversal of the German VAT cut.,True,orientation,True,True
In any case underlying inflation which is mainly driven by domestic services remains very low at 0.7 in April.,False,,False,False
Looking further ahead our March projections foresaw that mediumterm inflation would remain subdued only 1.2 in 2022 and 1.4 in 2023.,True,orientation,True,True
Recent inflation surveys are in line with this picture.,False,,True,False
I am concerned by the fact that over our policy horizon inflation is going to remain well below our objective of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
This may affect our credibility after so many years of inflation misses.,False,,True,True
Moreover toolow inflation aggravates the real cost of debt at a time when private and public debt ratios are rising in order to offset the collapse in income caused by the pandemic.,True,disease,True,True
It describes a situation where inflation expectations reanchor at very low levels and become hard to dislodge.,True,orientation,True,True
Longterm marketbased inflation expectations are still around 1.6 which is not optimal but a sign that the situation is very different from Japan.,True,orientation,True,True
But the European Central Bank ECB can bring inflation back to its objective.,True,orientation,True,True
We have the tools to push inflation close to 2.,True,machine,True,True
And there is general agreement in the Governing Council that the current levels of projected inflation are unsatisfactory.,True,orientation,True,True
It is clear to me that the level of inflation in the medium term is still decided by the central bank.,True,orientation,True,True
With demand still weak and underlying inflation at very low levels policy support remains essential and a premature tightening in financing conditions must be avoided.,True,orientation,True,True
In my view only a sustained increase in inflationary pressures reflected in an upward trend in underlying inflation and bringing inflation and inflation expectations in line with our aim could justify a reduction in our purchases.,True,orientation,True,True
And since then I have not seen changes in financing conditions or the economic outlook that would shift the inflation path upwards.,True,orientation,True,True
In this environment it is not surprising that we have also seen a persistent nonnegligible appreciation of the exchange rate which if sustained would weaken inflationary pressures.,True,orientation,True,True
We will discuss the implications of these trends in our June meeting especially in the light of the new projections for mediumterm inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
So let's see what the recovery will look like six or nine months from now and what happens to inflation and inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
And lets remember that even when the coronavirus phase is over inflation will still be far from our aim and we will need to use our tools to get back to our 2 goal.,True,orientation,True,True
They are conditional on seeing evidence of a robust recovery and sustained inflationary pressures reflected in an upward trend in underlying inflation that bring inflation and inflation expectations in line with our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
We should wait until we have more clarity on economic and inflationary developments and until we can be confident that they will enable us to deliver on our mandate.,True,orientation,True,True
This implies first that we neutralise the effects of the pandemic on inflation and second that we continue our policy action until we see inflation sustainably reaching levels in line with our aim in the nottoodistant future.,True,orientation,True,True
In my view it is reasonable to look at a horizon of around two years for inflation to converge towards our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
We will review it again at our June meeting when we assess the favourability of financing conditions together with the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
And alongside the recovery the markets also expect inflation to increase which puts pressure on yields.,True,other,True,True
So we monitor it very closely to see what effect it might have on growth and inflation.,True,other,True,True
We expect inflation to rise temporarily.,True,orientation,True,True
The third element was to make sure that monetary support that interest rate policy which of course these days is not just about the shortterm policy rate that we control but also through asset purchasing that longterm rates are also low enough to support a recovery and support inflation momentum.,True,machine,True,True
Essentially all of our tools are calibrated to make sure that we have price stability which in turn does require us to bring inflation up to a higher level.,True,orientation,True,True
The deeper analysis which I think the world shares behind that is essentially that its very important in this world where we do have a lower bound on interest rates where we do have currently low inflation that everyone concerned should understand that the inflation targets set by central banks are symmetric that these are not ceilings.,True,orientation,True,True
One way to make sure that people understand that the centre of the distribution needs to be anchored by the inflation target is that central banks are willing to see inflation not only be below that target but above that target.,True,orientation,True,True
One way to express that is by emphasising in a flexible way as the Fed always advertises average inflation targeting.,True,other,True,True
But actually I think its not necessarily the only way and as you know we have a strategy review on right now to explore in the European context in the context of where we are now which is different from where the Fed is what the best way to think about our inflation target should be.,True,other,True,True
Essentially there is no direct readacross because of course where Sweden is in terms of its inflation momentum is different from where the euro area is.,True,machine,True,True
But of course under other conditions when inflation momentum is a lot stronger the reaction may be different.,True,machine,True,True
In ourstrategyreviewwe discuss how to better capture housing costs in our inflation measure.,False,,True,False
We are carefully monitoring bank lending conditions.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Our inflation aim is defined over the medium term.,False,,True,False
Our current forecast suggests that inflation remains subdued over the projection horizonhttpsecb.europa.eupubprojectionshtmlindex.en.htmlAskECB Isabel_Schnabel Theoretically this depends on how real interest rates compare to real equilibrium rates.,False,,False,True
In practice this has to be judged in light of current and expected economic and inflation developments.,False,,True,False
Overvalued asset prices are one aspect but we do not target asset prices.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Our monetary policy depends on economic conditions in the euro area and in particular on our mediumterm inflation outlook.,False,,True,False
How this can be done is discussed in our ongoing.strategyreviewAskECB Isabel_Schnabel Our mediumterm inflation aim is symmetric we counter deviations to the upside and to the downside equally.,False,,False,False
Due to disinflationary shocks including severe crises inflation has fallen below our aim.,True,disease,True,True
Due to reasons explained in a recent Twitter thread this is not always visible in the weekly numbers.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Price changes of particular goods are not the same as general inflation.,False,,False,False
But inflation is currently projected to remain low in the medium term which justifies our highly accommodative stance.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel The inflation outlook is still well below our inflation aim of below but close to 2.,False,,True,True
Monetary policy has to remain accommodative including very low interest rates to get the economy back on track in line with our price stability mandate.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Our introductory statements clearly state that our inflation aim is symmetric.,False,,True,False
Lowering the inflation aim would carry the risk of hitting the effective lower bound more frequently.,False,,True,False
Without these measures the outlook for growth and inflation would be worse.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel The HICP is calculated independently by Eurostat not the ECB.,False,,False,True
Current inflation developments show substantial volatility due to various oneoff and temporary effects.,False,,True,False
Over the past decades the relationship between monetary aggregates and inflation has weakened.,False,,True,False
Spikes in food inflation thus push up overall inflation.,False,,True,False
We look through shortterm volatility.AskECB You can find out more about changes in consumption patterns during the COVID19 pandemic in our Economic Bulletinhttpswww.ecb.europa.eupubeconomicbulletinfocus2020htmlecb.ebbox202007_03e4d32ee4e7.en.html Isabel_Schnabel Most economists agree that deflation has worse economic consequences than small positive inflation.,False,,False,False
It leads to a deepening of recessions when agents postpone consumption investment in expectation of falling prices resulting in a deflationary spiral.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel We have indeed involved academics in our strategy review process through an Academic Roundtable and through our annual ECB Forum on Central Banking Sintra.,False,,False,False
I think that markets have understood what we want to do how we want to preserve favourable financing conditions and apply that joint assessment based on what we see on the financing conditions that are out there and our inflation aim.,True,other,True,True
And particularly our determination to return to a preCOVID19 state and then move on to our actual inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
The United States is probably going to hit its inflation targets rather soon.,True,sports,True,True
In 2021 we will probably see inflation at 1.5 and that is largely temporary and technical.,True,other,True,True
We are very attentive to the impact that it has on inflation obviously.,True,other,True,True
We need more ambition to help economic activity reach its potential and see inflation converge towards our aim.,True,orientation,True,True
If we hadnt intervened the tightening of financing conditions would have had a negative impact on growth and inflation in Europe.,True,other,True,True
With inflation projections still way below 2 we couldnt accept a tightening of financing conditions irrespective of its cause or origin this would have been inconsistent with our policy mandate.,True,other,True,True
Favourable financing conditions are an intermediate target for achieving our primary objective which is inflation close to 2.,True,warfare,True,True
In the United States inflation is seeing a return to healthy levels because monetary and fiscal policies are working forcefully together.,True,disease,True,True
In the euro area the mediumterm inflation outlook is unsatisfactory.,True,other,True,True
The best way to make central bankers less relevant in the future is to ensure that the economy improves and inflation reaches its objective.,True,orientation,True,True
My call for more action was specific to a situation like the one were in now where we are far away from our inflation aim.,True,orientation,True,True
We cannot be satisfied with inflation at 1.2 in 2022 and 1.4 in 2023.,True,other,True,False
It would make it more difficult to reanchor inflation expectations and we would risk a permanent reduction of economic potential.,True,orientation,True,True
Yes inflation is increasing.,True,orientation,True,True
And as we are still far from reaching our inflation aim of below but close to 2 a sustainable rise in the direction of 2 would be good news.,True,orientation,True,True
Our mediumterm projections show that the rate of inflation will ease again in 2022 because aggregate demand will presumably remain weak.,True,orientation,True,True
That people perceive inflation as being too high is something we experienced when the euro was introduced for example.,True,orientation,True,True
We need to better explain to the general public what inflation is.,True,other,True,True
And the measurement of inflation only captures an average it almost never reflects an individuals pattern of consumption.,True,other,True,True
Certainly yet perceived inflation is heavily influenced by goods that we consume more frequently.,True,other,True,True
But it will be some time before interest rates start rising again significantly assuming our inflation forecasts are accurate.,True,orientation,True,True
We have an inflation forecast which remains quite low so even in 2023 inflation is only at 1.4 in our forecast.,False,,False,False
In fact if we do see inflation pick up and let me emphasise what really matters with respect to inflation is economywide not just the viewpoint of financial traders but we would need to see it in firms and households as well so ideally any pickup in expected inflation if it adds to inflation momentum we welcome it.,True,machine,True,True
You have to compare the nominal yields we see with respecttothe inflation forecast we have which remains at 1.4 two years ahead.,False,,True,False
But the deeper point here is that in a world where essentially lots of central banks have a situation where inflation is too low compared to their target the universal emphasis and our emphasis has to be to make sure that monetary policy support remains in place until inflation is robustly where we want it to be.,True,orientation,True,True
Weve already given forward guidance since September 2019 and we want inflation to robustly converge to our targets.,True,orientation,True,True
And in the end its for us to determine as we did in the March decision based on the joint assessment of what's going on in terms of financing conditions and also what we see in terms of the inflation outlook that will determine how much we react in terms of the scale of asset purchasing.,False,,False,False
But the more overriding theme I think is with uncertainty about the pandemic the PEPP will adjust in a flexible way to make sure that financing conditions remain favourable and in particular that they've remained supportive of countering the pandemic shock to inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Underlying inflation remains subdued owing to weak demand and economic slackAskECB FrankElderson We dont see that.,True,disease,True,True

When we judge the pandemic crisis phase to be over and when we have managed to counter the shock to the inflation path it will be time to end it.,True,warfare,True,True
Our other instruments will remain available to ensure that inflation converges back to our mediumterm aim.,True,orientation,True,True
An increase in interest rates for example could be a result of an upward shift in inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
Coming back to the narrative of inflation in the euro area and to the 2015 to 2017 period when the recovery of inflation and the economy was quite muted it was due to a combination of the time it takes to recover from a financial crisis on one side and the prioritisation of fiscal consolidation on the other.,True,disease,True,True
In this context you might be more optimistic about inflation dynamics even if the pandemic itself is definitely a severe negative.,True,disease,True,True
We have an ongoing twostage challenge counter the negative pandemic shock to the inflation path and subsequently finish the task of raising inflation to our aim.,True,warfare,True,True
What is most important is converging to the target in good time with the speed of convergence ensuring that inflation expectations do not drift further away from the target.,True,orientation,True,True
Under these circumstances it is important to take decisive action to keep up the inflation momentum while recognising that patience is required.,True,machine,True,True
By and large I dont see any policy statement from any major central bank anywhere in the world saying they are going to deliver sustainable inflation at 2 per cent superquickly it is an uphill climb.,True,orientation,True,True
To me it is an efficiency issue rather than focus on pushing down the curve compared to the midDecember level monetary accommodation could be better provided by preserving favourable financial conditions especially in responding to a tightening that would be inconsistent with offsetting the pandemic shock to the inflation path.,True,warfare,True,True
Because as you know financial markets are very forwardlooking and you can have a steepening in yield curves which is not conducive to maintaining progress in terms of the inflation dynamic.,True,orientation,True,True
It does depend on how much progress we are making in terms of the inflation forecast.,True,orientation,True,True
It is not yield curve control in the sense of saying we want to keep the yield curve at some fixed value because over time the relation between the appropriate level of yields and inflation will move.,True,orientation,True,True
We have quite volatile inflation during the pandemic but we look past most of that.,True,disease,True,True
The important point here is that we provide enough monetary accommodation to make sure that financing conditions are favourable so that the pandemic shock to inflation is offset and we deliver a path to convergence with the inflation target.,True,warfare,True,True
But as you know across Europe there are very different histories of inflation and the history of inflation in some European countries is very different to the American experience.,True,other,True,True
No one would go for a strict version of averaging where a period of inflation above target inflation would require engineering a subsequent period of belowtarget inflation to hit the average.,True,machine,True,True
But the history of inflation matters.,True,other,True,True
Its too early in our process to say there is only one way to ensure that inflation expectations are where we want them to be.,True,other,True,True
There is a very strong analytical case for flexible average inflation targeting but there are other options that may also be successful in anchoring inflation expectations.,True,orientation,True,True
We would expect to see inflation above 1 on average during the whole of 2021.,False,,False,False
We projected an increase in inflation in 2021.,False,,True,False
In 2020 inflation was 0.3 and with the recovery of the economy we projected in December that inflation would be 1 on average.,False,,False,False
In terms of this debate surrounding inflation we need to take into account that there are forces at odds with each other.,True,warfare,True,True
All in all I would say that we do not need to be very concerned about inflation in the short term and in the medium term we will continue to look at it very carefully as we always do.,False,,True,False
There are structural factors that could push inflation up all over the world for instance supply chains are going to be more regional than before and globalisation is not going to be as rapid as it was in the last ten years.,True,orientation,True,True
But in the short term in the next 12 months inflation will remain below our aim on average.,False,,True,False
We have recently seen an increase in yields which is partly due to the expectation of higher inflation in the United States because of President Bidens programme as well as the increase in commodity prices and the recovery in global demand.,True,orientation,True,True
This will be the key factor over the coming weeks and months for our monetary policy i.e. understanding whether this increase in yields is due to trends in inflation or whether there are other factors that could hinder economic recovery.,True,orientation,True,True
This means assessing whether or not our actions are limited to what is essential to achieve the objectives and whether the main effect we are looking for in this case the recovery of the economy employment and inflation clearly outweighs the potential side effects.,True,orientation,True,True
We can start by analysing the impact climate change will have on inflation because its going to have an impact for sure.,True,other,True,True
Our primary objective is price stability so our objective is for inflation to be below but close to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We have had difficulties reaching that objective but you have to bear in mind that there were structural factors behind the low inflation rate like globalisation demographic change and online shopping.,True,orientation,True,True
But more fundamentally price stability should be maintained over the medium term and since the euros introduction the average inflation rate in the euro area has been slightly above 1.6. Having said that the definition of price stability is one of the points we will look at as part of our strategy review.,True,orientation,True,True
We are looking very carefully at measures of inflation compensation.,True,other,True,True
What we are seeing is a mix of a rise in expected inflation and an increase in the inflation risk premium.,True,orientation,True,True
And this is actually good news because it shows that scenarios of the world economy heading into deflation are much less likely.,True,orientation,True,True
Our December projections had inflation at 1.4 in 2023 so it is still very low and lots of support is still needed for it to climb upwards.,True,orientation,True,True
What were seeing now is not a significant and persistent change in the path of inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
At this stage an excessive tightening in yields would be inconsistent with fighting the pandemic shock to the inflation path.,True,warfare,True,True
These questions all come into sharp focus especially when we have a new inflation forecast.,True,other,True,True
Since then the focus of monetary policy has shifted to providing favourable financing conditions in order to bring inflation back to a level that is consistent with our mediumterm aim.,True,orientation,True,True
The pandemic has put downward pressure on inflation which we have countered through the introduction of various crisis measures particularly through our new asset purchase programme the pandemic emergency purchase programme PEPP and our longerterm refinancing operations.,True,orientation,True,True
We expect economic growth and inflation in the euro area to return to their prepandemic levels before the end of this year.,False,,True,False
Prior to the pandemic inflation was hovering around 1 per cent but with a dynamic where inflation would over time rise closer towards 2 per cent it was not a crisis situation.,True,orientation,True,True
But the reason for the low interest rates and our bond purchases are the low inflation pressures which is also true in the United States and in the United Kingdom.,True,other,True,True
What we do is driven by the price stability mandate and asset purchase programmes are only required when inflation pressures are too weak and interest rates are already very low.,True,other,True,True
We look at whether our monetary policy decisions move perceptions of the inflation rate in the right direction.,True,orientation,True,True
If anything the fact that people across Europe perceive the inflation rate in different ways suggests that prices are stable overall.,True,orientation,True,True
In countries with really high inflation rates everyone is acutely aware of just how much the prices have increased.,True,orientation,True,True
The first estimates of the January inflation rate in Germany have just been published.,False,,False,False
Moreover its not easy to measure inflation right now because our basket of goods has changed significantly.,False,,True,True
All of this is reflected in the basket of goods considered for inflation measurement.,False,,True,False
This means that one year later we will see that inflation will be particularly high.,False,,True,False
We are expecting the inflation rate to pick up in the course of this year.,True,orientation,True,True
We must be careful however not to mistake these shortterm developments for a sustained increase in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
This is why we continue to be more worried about inflation being too low rather than too high.,True,orientation,True,True
We are facing a very challenging economic situation and we need to see how we can bring inflation closer to levels that are consistent with our inflation target.,True,orientation,True,True
Compared with the long course of economic history inflation has only been as low as it is now for a relatively small number of years.,True,orientation,True,True
The fact that inflation has been so low for several years is mainly due to structural changes in our economy.,True,orientation,True,True
Some economists such as Charles Goodhart argue that inflation will increase markedly again because these factors could reverse.,True,orientation,True,True
The economy was subject to a whole series of disinflationary shocks.,True,disease,True,True
The pandemic has now pushed inflation further down over the past few months.,True,orientation,True,True
But we expect that will change and that relative to the current negative levels 2021 will see an increase in inflation.,True,orientation,True,False
The decline in energy prices was a major reason for the sharp fall in inflation in 2020.,True,orientation,True,True
But such a shortterm development should not be mistaken for a sustained increase in inflation which is likely to only emerge very slowly.,True,plant,True,True
At present there are no indications that we need to be concerned about inflation being too high.,True,orientation,True,True
At the moment ECB policy rates must be higher to curb inflation and bring it down to our target of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
That process is essential because it would be even worse if we allowed inflation to become entrenched in the economy.,True,plant,True,True
When it comes to inflation projections for the entire horizon have been revised upward which is also the reason for raising interest rates as well as for anticipating further rate hikes.,True,orientation,True,True
An important factor in this respect is that we must not allow inflationary expectations to become deanchored or wages to have an inflationary effect.,True,machine,True,True
We know wages are increasing probably at a faster pace than expected but we must be wary that they do not start fuelling inflation.,True,fire,True,True
We have to take the necessary measures to return to our target inflation rate of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We have to show resilience in the face of persistent inflation and we must be careful in considering not only its symptoms but also its roots.,True,disease,True,True
What is causing inflation?,False,,True,False
But now we need to be careful that the domestic causes that we are seeing which are mainly related to fiscal measures and wage dynamics do not lead to inflation becoming entrenched.,True,plant,True,True
What matters is that the circumstances the difficulties we are facing and the type of inflation we are fighting are inevitably changing peoples perspectives.,True,warfare,True,True
The current economic environment of high inflation low growth and tighter financing conditions poses considerable challenges for firms across the euro area and is affecting their overall competitiveness.,True,other,True,True
The high inflation rates that we are seeing across Europe are coinciding with an economic slowdown and low growth.,True,other,True,True
Our latest macroeconomic projections which we published on 15 December show that the euro area economic outlook has deteriorated with more persistent inflation than envisaged.,True,disease,True,True
Based on our calculations we expect inflation to fall to our 2 target in the second half of 2025.,True,orientation,True,True
As we announced this month there will be further necessary rate hikes until inflation is on a path back to close to our 2 target.,True,orientation,True,True
24 December 2022 I have been working intensely on how to tackle high inflation all year.,True,warfare,True,True
With inflation at times exceeding 10 we can hardly speak of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
That is why we are doing whatever is necessary to bring inflation back to our mediumterm target of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
In a speech that I gave in July 2021 I presented a series of indicators pointing towards a rise in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
For a long time we believed that many of the causes of inflation would vanish over time.,True,disease,True,True
Put simply the 10 inflation that we observe today can be divided into two parts the first 5 emerged in the year 2021 and the second in 2022.,True,other,True,True
Not only energy prices rose steeply but also core inflation that is inflation stripped of the volatile prices for energy and food.,True,orientation,True,True
By that time it was clear to everyone that inflation would be more persistent.,True,disease,True,True
The challenge is to identify the causes of inflation and the correct response in real time.,True,warfare,True,True
If we knew that supply chain disruptions and the strong surge in energy prices would disappear quickly and that the high inflation would not spark any secondround effects monetary policy would not have to react at all to such supplyside shocks because it would only take effect when the shock has already abated.,True,disease,True,True
We underestimated the persistence of inflation and initially did not take the signs of higher inflation seriously enough not least because we were coming out of a phase in which the main risk had been that of too low inflation.,True,disease,True,True
For some time financial markets assumed that at the first sign of a trend reversal of inflation the ECB would stop raising rates forcefully.,True,orientation,True,True
ECB President Christine Lagarde stated unequivocally that we would continue raising interest rates for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our mediumterm target of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Whether we will still need to go higher than that will depend on the future inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
In any case we clearly have to reach an interest rate that is high enough to bring inflation back down to 2.,True,orientation,True,False
This means that the inflation problem will not go away on its own.,True,disease,True,True
We could end up overreacting if we were to only focus on the current rate of inflation.,True,other,True,True
That is why we need models that give us an indication in spite of all the uncertainty as to how our interest rate increases affect the economy and inflation over the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
The uncertainty for 2025 is high and we know that the models tend to project that inflation eventually returns towards 2.,True,orientation,True,False
Still in our projections inflation remains notably above 2 over an extended period.,True,orientation,True,True
As inflation expectations are strongly dependent on what people are actually experiencing this can affect wage and price setting.,True,other,True,True
A long phase of very high inflation as we are currently seeing is therefore problematic.,True,disease,True,True
It is the tool with which we want to reduce inflation.,True,machine,True,True
At the same time such a large ECB balance sheet is evidently incompatible with the current inflation outlook.,True,machine,True,True
In addition investments and structural reforms are necessary for fighting the root causes of inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
That is why many of these measures actually tend to fuel inflation in the medium term.,True,fire,True,True
Our projections therefore expect the euro area to fall into a mild recession in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter of 2023 when GDP is expected to contract by 0.1. Look at our inflation projections.,False,,False,False
The change in our growth projections between the two is not big they are slightly better than expected for 2022 revised up from 3.1 to 3.4 slightly lower for 2023 revised down from 0.9 to 0.5 and identical for 2024 1.9. But the substantial change concerns inflation which has been revised up quite significantly from 5.5 to 6.3 for 2023 and from 2.3 to 3.4 for 2024.,False,,True,True
We think that over the course of the next two or three months inflation will be somewhere around its current level then in the second quarter of next year it will see a drop to hover around 7 by the middle of the year.,True,orientation,True,True
But that is still clearly above our price stability target i.e. inflation of 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,False
If we do nothing the situation would be worse because inflation is one of the factors behind the current recession.,True,other,True,True
By reducing inflation well contribute to growth.,True,other,True,True
The steps we have taken so far are going to have an impact on inflation but we still need to do more.,True,other,True,True
But it is very important that we dont lose our credibility thats to say that inflation expectations do not start to become deanchored.,True,orientation,True,True
If households start thinking that the ECB is not doing enough and they expect inflation to be 7 or 8 over the next three years they would then ask for a pay increase of 7 or 8 triggering the spiral.,True,other,True,True
And if you look at Spain figures from the Banco de España show that 25 of new wage agreements are now indexed to inflation.,True,other,True,True
The best way to help governments is to reduce inflation.,True,other,True,True
But we have a mandate and we have to stick to it inflation is currently at 10 and core inflation at 5 whereas our target is 2.,True,other,True,True
Because if we dont control inflation if we do not put inflation on a convergence trajectory towards 2 it will be impossible for the economy to rebound.,True,orientation,True,True
Financial stability conditions have deteriorated because of lower growth higher inflation and the tightening of financial conditions.,True,other,True,True
I am concerned that markets could underestimate the persistence of inflation.,True,other,True,True
Euro area inflation has decreased from 10.6 to 10.1 but that is not enough.,True,other,True,True
6 December 2022 Its probably too early to make that judgement but I would be reasonably confident in saying that it is likely we are close to peak inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Given the significant increase in prices I dont rule out some extra inflation early next year.,True,other,True,True
Once we are past the initial months of 2023 later on in 2023 in the spring or summer we should see a sizeable drop in the inflation rate.,True,orientation,True,True
That said the journey of inflation from the current very high levels back to 2 will take time.,True,orientation,True,True
This could happen because a big driver of core inflation at the moment is the fact that many sectors across the economy such as transportation and tourism use a lot of energy so when there is a high increase in their energy costs they have to raise the prices of the services and goods they sell and then core inflation rises.,True,machine,True,True
Typically you could expect inflation to get closer to our target with extra time.,True,orientation,True,True
This does not have an immediate effect on inflation but over the next one or two years those higher interest rates will dampen demand reduce expenditure and therefore reduce the ability of firms to charge high prices and in turn limit the scope of unsustainable wage increases.,True,fire,True,True
So a basic reason why inflation will be closer to our target is the actions of our monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
We also do think that we will not experience the same energy inflation every year.,True,other,True,True
But let me also say we do think there will be a second round of inflation.,True,sports,True,True
So the second round effects will drive inflation next year and in 2024.,True,sports,True,True
Having a rate of 0.5 was no longer appropriate when inflation risks had gone up.,True,orientation,True,True
But it is also true that we need to recognise that the interest rate decisions we have already made will help to reduce the inflation rate next year and the year after that.,True,other,True,True
We do expect that more rate increases will be necessary but a lot has been done already so we will have to ensure we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook and the risk factors when setting the interest rate on a meetingbymeeting basis.,True,other,True,True
We will still be guided by the inflation outlook.,True,machine,True,True
Compared to a more severe recession a milder and shorter recession is good news for Europe but it does mean that its antiinflation impact will be relatively limited.,True,other,True,True
It boils down to all the factors that influence the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
So first and foremost the inflation forecast.,True,other,True,True
Third there are the other indicators of the inflation dynamics.,True,machine,True,True
So our assessment takes into account the inflation outlook for the euro area the global inflation outlook and the global central bank outlook as well.,True,other,True,True
Once we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook we will examine the implications for the terminal rate.,True,other,True,True
If the euro area runs up larger fiscal deficits this will increase overall demand in the economy and that will in turn imply higher interest rates to make sure that inflation returns to 2.,True,orientation,True,False
It is important to recognise that the worstcase scenario is one where inflation remains too high for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
History teaches us that it is very costly to get rid of entrenched inflation.,True,disease,True,True
We need to avoid that by making sure that inflation goes back to 2 in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
There is a hierarchy we need to get inflation back under control and towards the target.,True,orientation,True,True
The medium term can be longer if the deviation of inflation is not too great but should be shorter if we have a big inflation gap to fix.,True,machine,True,True
So we use the expression in a timely manner not to tie us to any particular year or period of time but to essentially signal that we want to get inflation back to 2 at an appropriate speed and not to take too long.,True,orientation,True,True
So its not satisfactory to say that inflation will be at 2 many years from now.,True,orientation,True,True
We have to make sure that inflation is back to 2 within a reasonable time horizon and the Governing Council will decide exactly what that will be.,True,orientation,True,True
The primary focus is on inflation.,True,other,True,True
What matters is the inflation outlook in the medium term which also depends on the economy and is not only linked to current inflation.,True,other,True,True
Number one inflation is higher now than was expected in the last round.,False,,True,False
So the starting point for inflation is different compared to the last round.,False,,True,False
So there is more fiscal support for the economy next year and that has inflation implications.,False,,True,True
And as we already had in September there will have to be a kind of reassessment of the wage outlook in the context of the higher inflation rates the status of the labour market and the fiscal support that is still there.,False,,True,True
Even if this does not have an immediate effect on the economy and on inflation we would expect to see it kicking in more strongly in 2024 and 2025.,True,sports,True,True
So for those years the forecast will have to balance the fact that inflation has a knockon effect for example on the wage mechanism.,True,machine,True,True
Even if the energy shock levels out next year so it's no longer a source of inflation and even if globally bottlenecks are easing so the pressure from global commodity prices and global goods prices also levels off there's still going to be an inflation dynamic in 202425.,True,liquids,True,True
Labour costs are a big fraction of the domestic component of inflation.,False,,True,False
But how much and for how long labour costs will contribute to domestic inflation remains open and is a source of high uncertainty.,True,other,True,True
We've done a good amount of monetary policy normalisation and we gave a clear signal that we will continue to raise rates until we have reached a level that will make sure inflation comes back to 2 per cent in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
Another way of saying this is that firms and workers should fully understand that inflation is going to come down over these years towards our 2 per cent target.,True,orientation,True,True
We will have to look at it in terms of the inflation outlook that we have in December and take into account that we are at a different point now and also to recognise that there are lags in the transmission process.,False,,False,False
There's going to be a fairly large reduction in the inflation rates simply through base effects.,True,other,True,True
But even if that reduces the inflation rate it still leaves the cost of living permanently higher.,True,orientation,True,True
Going back to the monetary policy issue we have to think about where inflation is headed in 202425 and what the distance is to our 2 per cent target.,True,orientation,True,True
Because if you undertighten inflation remains too high for too long and then in turn you may end up having a bigger recession later on with a bigger permanent drop in output.,True,orientation,True,True
If tightening in the rest of the world leads to lower global inflation pressures lower commodity prices lower pressure on tradeable goods prices then the inflation forecast could improve for international reasons in addition to domestic reasons.,True,liquids,True,True
What we see this year is a sharp change in the inflation outlook which in turn led to a sizeable revision in monetary policies around the world.,True,orientation,True,True
But what is true is that having fiscal deficits that remain relatively high will support demand in the economy and add to mediumterm inflation pressures.,True,liquids,True,True
One is a decline in global inflation pressure which will also benefit the euro area by lowering pressure on import prices.,True,liquids,True,True
The other element could be a decline in domestic inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And we saw that in fact services inflation came down as well.,True,orientation,True,True
On our side I do think that what we've done has helped in the sense of ending the QE programmes and the bynow sizeable and repeated increases in policy rates the actions we take demonstrate that there will be downward pressure on inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
Then you come to the near term and that's where we should take into account that there is a lot of inflation pressure remaining in the pipeline but this differs across countries.,True,machine,True,True
In some countries Spain for example energy inflation may have come down primarily because a lot of the adjustment happened a year ago.,True,orientation,True,True
Sooner rather than later the accumulated passthrough will convert into downward pressure on inflation but lets see whether the peak turns out to be this side of Christmas or the other.,True,liquids,True,True
I do think by and large across all types of surveys and market indicators people believe that over a longer horizon inflation will get back to 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
People also understand that in the near term over the next number of months inflation is going to be elevated compared to our targets.,True,orientation,True,True
Where do people think inflation will be in 2023 2024 2025?,False,,True,False
That will influence pricing decisions and wage decisions while also recognising that these mediumterm inflation expectations clearly will also be influenced by our decisions.,True,orientation,True,False
In some sectors where demand was surprisingly strong this year it is clear that one major source of inflation was not cost increases it was firms responding to high demand compared to supply by raising markups.,True,other,True,True
We will continue raising rates to a level that ensures inflation will come back into line with our definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
That level will depend on the data that we receive the evolution of inflation economic conditions demand and energy prices.,True,plant,True,True
At our next meeting we will base our decision on the new projections that will be released in December and Eurostats flash inflation estimate for November among other indicators.,True,other,True,True
We are mainly guided by inflation and if you look at its evolution in October you can see it is accelerating.,True,machine,True,True
Core inflation rose to 5.,True,orientation,True,True
In December we will have new projections about the future evolution of inflation.,True,plant,True,True
I think we have been underestimating inflation for a long time which is why it's important to have a much better understanding of inflation dynamics.,True,machine,True,True
My opinion is that inflation will hover around its present level of 10.7 over the next few months.,True,orientation,True,True
It will start to decline in the first half of next year but on average headline and core inflation will remain very high.,True,orientation,True,True
We have all been underestimating inflation dynamics.,True,machine,True,True
Energy prices have had a lot to do with the evolution of inflation.,True,plant,True,True
By looking at the trajectory of energy prices we can explain an important part of the evolution of headline inflation.,True,orientation,True,False
But beyond that energy also indirectly influences other items in the basket of goods and services which are the main components of the current core inflation.,True,other,True,True
On top of this current inflation is significantly reducing households real disposable income and negatively affecting capital expenditure.,True,disease,True,True
When you have inflation at the level that we have now all the signals from the markets start to blur and capital allocation becomes much more difficult.,True,orientation,True,True
In this context I think that the best contribution that a central bank can make towards restoring future growth is to reduce inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The economic slowdown including a possible technical recession is driven by several factors energy prices uncertainty because of the war and the dampening effect of inflation on investment and on household consumption through cuts in real disposable incomes.,True,disease,True,True
In conclusion if we want to improve the growth outlook it is very important to tackle inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
The factors behind high inflation are the same as those behind the slowing down of the economy.,True,machine,True,True
We have to do our job and we have to explain what we are doing and why we need to tackle inflation which is not an easy fight.,True,warfare,True,True
One of the main reasons for the slowdown including the technical recession we might face over the next quarters is inflation.,True,disease,True,True
So reducing inflation is one of the main contributions that we can make in order to improve the growth outlook in the short to medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
If we do not reduce inflation the situation will be much worse.,True,orientation,True,True
Financial stability has deteriorated quite a lot over the last six months because of the economic outlook of lower growth and high inflation and the tightening of financial conditions.,True,other,True,True
As you know inflation in Latvia stood at 21.8 in October which is well above the euro area average of 10.7. Higher energy and food prices are still the main drivers of price increases.,False,,False,True
And we expect to raise interest rates further to make sure that inflation returns to our mediumterm target of 2 in a timely manner.,False,,True,False
We will decide on future policy steps meeting by meeting each time assessing how the outlook for the economy and inflation has evolved also considering how the measures we have taken so far are working.,False,,False,False
The longer inflation stays at such high levels the greater the risk that it spreads throughout the economy.,True,disease,True,True
Consumers and companies would then also start to expect higher inflation rates in future and that is dangerous.,True,disease,True,True
That is something we must avoid.And this is why we are determined to do what is necessary to bring inflation back to our 2 target.,False,,True,True
Ultimately persistently high inflation rates are more damaging to society because they make everybody poorer.,True,disease,True,True
We are aiming for the interest rate that will deliver the 2 mediumterm inflation target.,False,,True,True
The high rates of inflation that we are currently seeing are weighing on households disposable income especially for those households whose income was low in the first place.,True,machine,True,True
Because only then will they help prevent the effects of high inflation from spreading throughout the economy and limit the impact on public finances.,True,disease,True,True
This will then also lower inflationary pressures.,True,machine,True,True
Large parts of inflation are being driven by higher energy costs.,True,machine,True,True
The baseline projections showed inflation at 8.1 this year 5.5 next year and 2.3 in 2024.,False,,True,False
The downside scenario foresees slightly higher inflation rates for this year and next reaching 2.7 in 2024.,False,,True,False
14 October 2022 An important part of the inflationary process that we are now facing has been driven by external factors such as increased energy prices more expensive raw materials food etc.,False,,False,False
According to our calculations energy and food prices currently account for twothirds of inflation in the euro area.,False,,True,False
However inflation is also being pushed up by demand for goods and services as is particularly the case in the Baltic countries.,False,,True,False
Nevertheless it is very important to avoid secondround effects and prevent inflation being passed on to wages which would push inflation higher.,True,orientation,True,True
In order to avoid this inflation expectations need to remain anchored.,True,machine,True,True
We will do whatever is necessary to bring inflation back to our 2 target over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
From an economic perspective lower oil prices could help reduce inflation and at the same time support the economic recovery thereby facilitating the decisions of policymakers.,True,orientation,True,True
I think we are going to face a very difficult combination of low economic growth including the possibility of a technical recession and high inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
According to our September projections inflation will be hovering around 10 until the end of this year and will start to gradually decline in 2023.,True,orientation,True,True
In this context monetary policy has to focus on the evolution of inflation which is what the Governing Council will be looking at when taking decisions.,False,,True,False
The current global context including the monetary policy action the energy shock and deterioration of the terms of trade among others point towards a slowdown of the global economy and eventually of the inflation rate as well.,True,orientation,True,True
Under the downside scenario annual inflation is expected to decline from an average rate of 8.4 this year to 6.9 in 2023.,True,orientation,True,True
Under the baseline scenario inflation is expected to go down from an average of 8.1 this year to 5.5 in 2023.,True,orientation,True,True
In December we will have new projections for inflation and GDP growth that will guide our decisions despite the high uncertainty.,True,orientation,True,True
In my view structural factors that pushed inflation down in recent times have started to shift.,True,orientation,True,True
Globalisation is not going to be as intense as it was and the energy shock can drive inflation higher.,True,machine,True,True
So I think that monetary policy has to adjust to these new structural features that may push inflation upwards when compared to the past decade.,True,orientation,True,True
We cannot ignore the fact that inflation is the main problem in the euro area which is quite obvious in the Baltic countries.,True,disease,True,True
Higher interest rates are needed to try to subdue the rising level of inflation that is clearly above our 2 target over the medium term.,True,warfare,True,True
The main problem is inflation which currently is above 20 at levels also observed in the other Baltic countries.,True,disease,True,True
Disparities in inflation rates among euro area countries will have to be monitored and analysed in detail.,True,other,True,True
High inflation will have to be reflected in higher wages.,True,other,True,True
But trying to fully shield workers from inflation through higher pay would lead to a big increase in costs for firms and secondround effects.,True,warfare,True,True
Then next year trade unions would again have to say inflation is still high we need another large pay increase.,True,other,True,True
Many of the wage rises we are currently seeing in the euro area are balanced and in the middle ground where there is some attempt to make sure that the living standards of workers do not suffer too much but also a recognition that fully protecting workers by matching inflation one for one in wage agreements would be selfdefeating.,True,warfare,True,True
This would just prolong very high inflation rates which would require a much bigger and tougher monetary policy response.,True,warfare,True,True
I would strongly warn firms not to expect the same level of profitability in times of high inflation.,True,other,True,True
In order to get back to lower inflation we need to realise that corporate profitability will decrease for a while and that wages will not fully keep up with inflation for a while either.,True,orientation,True,True
But we expect inflation to decrease significantly in 2023 with further decreases in 2024.,True,orientation,True,False
Prior to the pandemic the low price of oil and the contribution of supply from China and other emerging market economies to reducing prices especially of manufactured goods ensured that inflation remained low.,True,other,True,True
These forces are unlikely to return which will probably raise inflationary pressure compared to the prepandemic period of extremely low inflation.,True,other,True,True
Greater inflationary pressure does not necessarily mean that we will experience high inflation because we can take action against that.,True,warfare,True,True
The reality is that inflation has both a global and a domestic component but the domestic component is pretty large.,True,other,True,True
Absolutely we do have to take into account the fact that central banks around the world are now tightening policy which will lower global inflation.,True,other,True,True
So when we say inflation will come down in Europe it's partly because global inflation will come down.,True,orientation,True,True
But we also need to do our part of the job and make sure that the domestic component of inflation which is responsive to our monetary policy comes down.,True,orientation,True,True
If inflation is running at nine per cent as it is right now this is a major challenge for everyone.,True,sports,True,True
If you support those in need through higher taxes it has less of an effect on inflation than if you increase deficits.,True,other,True,True
Most of the improvement in inflation will come from energy prices stabilising and bottlenecks easing because that is basically an improvement on the supply side of the economy.,True,machine,True,True
It is our task to ensure that annual inflation is at 2 over the medium term.,True,other,True,True
Right now we are far away from our target inflation is much too high.,True,orientation,True,True
Current inflation is mostly driven by a strong increase in energy prices.,True,machine,True,True
The ECBs monetary policy affects inflation mainly through demand.,True,machine,True,True
As a result inflation falls.,True,orientation,True,True
According to our projections it will take until 2024 for inflation to stabilise around our 2 target.,True,orientation,True,True
As I said current inflation is in large part due to factors we cannot influence directly.,False,,True,False
It weighs on economic growth and drives inflation further up.,True,orientation,True,True
This sent out an important signal We are doing whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our 2 target.,True,orientation,True,True
In the spring it was impossible to say what impact the war would have on economic developments and inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
In the view of the ECBs Governing Council the steps taken to reach our mediumterm inflation target were appropriate at the time.,False,,True,True
The signal we sent with our latest interest rate hike is clear we are taking decisive steps to curb inflation and are making sure that it stabilises again at 2 in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
A looming downturn would have a dampening effect on inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
We are deciding meeting by meeting based on an assessment of all the economic and inflation data.,True,other,True,False
We see with some concern that more people expect inflation to exceed our 2 target also in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
This makes it all the more important to send clear signals that people can rely on the ECB and that inflation will go down again.,True,orientation,True,True
We acted decisively at times when inflation was too low and during the coronavirus pandemic we contributed significantly to Europe emerging from this severe crisis in good shape economically.,True,disease,True,True
If employees against the backdrop of rising inflation expectations demand very high wage increases and businesses then pass these on through even higher prices wages and prices can drive each other up.,True,machine,True,True
So far wage agreements are nowhere near keeping pace with inflation.,True,sports,True,True
We need to avoid that people expect permanently high inflation.,True,other,True,True
When designing fiscal support programmes care should be taken that they do not further fuel inflation.,True,fire,True,True
Government relief measures for the broad mass of the population could stimulate demand and push up inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
That is why we are guided by inflation in the euro area even if the situation naturally differs from one country to another.,True,orientation,True,True
In 2024 inflation is projected to be 2.3 on average in the euro area.,False,,False,False
The reality is that inflation is currently 9.1 and our target is 2 over the medium term.,False,,True,True
Within the Governing Council we do not have any estimates of the terminal rate the maximum level to which rates could rise or the neutral rate the rate that balances the economy at full employment with stable inflation.,False,,False,False
But as the President indicated more hikes might come in the next few months how many times and by how much will depend fundamentally on the data and we underscore our full determination to make inflation converge towards our definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
According to our projections in 2024 we will be a little above our target with average inflation of 2.3 in the euro area.,False,,False,False
We expect that inflation will start to decline to an average of 5.5 in 2023 which is still a lot.,True,orientation,True,True
The projections over the last 12 months have underestimated the evolution of inflation.,False,,True,False
We have a much better understanding of the drivers of inflation the interplay between supply and demand factors and the need to avoid secondround effects.,True,machine,True,True
It is key for us to keep inflation expectations anchored and under control.,True,machine,True,True
But inflation expectations are something that we can influence very rapidly.,True,machine,True,True
First that the ECB is fully committed to reducing inflation in line with our 2 target over the medium term and second that we should avoid secondround effects on inflation.,True,machine,True,True
There is a unanimous position with respect to the need to maintain our credibility and commitment to reduce inflation in line with our target.,True,machine,True,True
The downside scenario results in a recession of 0.9 with inflation close to 7 in 2023.,True,orientation,True,True
The slowdown of the economy is not going to take care of inflation on its own.,True,disease,True,True
The forces that are behind the economic slowdown are very similar to those pushing inflation higher.,True,orientation,True,True
We have a supply shock that is lowering growth and simultaneously raising inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Let me be very clear the slowdown of the economy will reduce demand pressures which will lower inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
But simultaneously we have to act from the monetary policy standpoint to keep inflation expectations anchored and avoid secondround effects.,True,machine,True,True
The level of inflation that we have now in Europe is undeniably already causing pain.,True,disease,True,True
In my view Jerome Powells message is that we will have to take decisions to reduce inflation that might be painful in the short and medium term but that will be positive for our citizens in the long run.,True,disease,True,True
We know that inflation is causing a lot of pain particularly for lowincome households.,True,disease,True,True
This is why it is really important that fiscal policy plays a role in alleviating the pain inflicted by inflation on these vulnerable groups.,True,disease,True,True
The figures are very good although this is partly due to inflation helping to increase revenues this year.,True,other,True,True
It creates leeway to support the groups hit hardest by inflation and the slowdown of the economy.,True,warfare,True,True
Further depreciation of the euro could be detrimental to inflationary pressures.,True,disease,True,True
On the contrary if the euro stopped depreciating this could be positive and support the fight against inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Im not concerned about the outcome I know we will return to an inflation rate close to 2 but when?,False,,True,False
In early July we presented some modifications to the way in which climate considerations are integrated into the econometric models that we use for monetary policy as climate change is having a clear impact especially on inflation.,True,other,True,True
What I can do best in my position is to lower inflation to restore price stability and set a horizon.,True,orientation,True,True
Headline inflation in the euro area increased again in July and now stands at 8.9. Energy prices particularly gas and food prices are playing an important role.,False,,False,False
We see high and increasing inflation rates in services and for nonenergy industrial goods.,False,,True,False
If you look at any of our measures of underlying inflation they are moving up further and stand at historical highs.,False,,False,False
These inflationary pressures are likely to be with us for some time they wont vanish quickly.,True,disease,True,True
Even with the ongoing monetary policy normalisation it will take some time until inflation gets back to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
This speaks in favour of giving more weight to actual inflation outcomes in monetary policy decisions.,False,,True,True
I would not exclude that in the short run inflation is going to increase further.,True,orientation,True,True
So it's very difficult to predict when inflation is going to peak.,True,orientation,True,True
We have seen that our models have not been particularly good in projecting the future path of inflation.,False,,True,False
Therefore current inflation outcomes provide additional useful information.,False,,True,False
Economic growth of course has an impact on the inflation projection.,False,,True,False
Still even if we entered a recession its quite unlikely that inflationary pressures will abate by themselves.,True,disease,True,True
The growth slowdown is then probably not sufficient to dampen inflation even if it reduces the price pressures due to slowing demand.,True,fire,True,True
In Germany it's relatively likely that inflation is going to move up further because some government measures that were used to fight inflation are going to be reversed or new measures introduced.,True,warfare,True,True
Most measures of longerterm inflation expectations remain around 2.,True,disease,True,False
If you look at our household survey the Consumer Expectations Survey we can see that the median expectation of inflation three years ahead has edged up after having been anchored at 2 throughout the pandemic.,False,,True,True
And maybe most importantly we see that the right tail of these distributions has shifted upwards meaning that an increasing share of survey respondents expect inflation to be well above our target.,True,orientation,True,True
Our monetary policy decisions are guided by the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
We are currently seeing very high inflation rates.,True,orientation,True,True
Our latest projected inflation numbers were also quite high and the factors driving inflation are not disappearing anytime soon.,True,orientation,True,True
In July we decided to raise rates by 50 basis points because we were concerned about the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
It's not about preference it's about what is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
In July we decided on a 50 basis point hike in light of the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
We need to decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance in order to bring inflation down to 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
But persistent exchange rate movements matter for monetary policy because they have an impact on the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
The main one was the continued acceleration of inflation in June.,True,machine,True,True
I think there are a variety of elements behind the evolution of inflation.,True,plant,True,True
First the increase in energy and commodity prices which is affecting inflation worldwide second systemic supplyside shocks and third the sharp increase in demand as the European economy reopened after the pandemic.,True,other,True,True
Therefore inflation is not due to a single factor but to a combination of factors.,True,other,True,False
The recent projections of the European Commission clearly show a slowdown in growth while inflation is expected to remain high in the coming months.,True,orientation,True,True
Therefore we are going to face a combination of slow growth and high inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Therefore the main factor that will guide our decisions will be the evolution of inflation.,True,plant,True,True
On the monetary policy side we have to monitor inflation very carefully because while in some countries like Estonia inflation is very high there are other countries where inflation is considerably lower around 6.,True,orientation,True,True
Undoubtedly the depreciation of the euro has been one of the factors behind the high inflation and the rise in energy prices denominated in euro.,True,orientation,True,True
The exchange rate was of course considered in our discussion last week as we are aware of its impact on the evolution of inflation.,True,plant,True,True
Thats how we can steer inflation.,True,machine,True,True
But in fact the unusually high level of inflation has now been persisting for much longer than expected.,True,orientation,True,True
Keep in mind though that the high inflation rate also means that your parents themselves have less to spend.,True,other,True,True
The Governing Council has indicated that it is fully committed to taking inflation back to our definition of price stability 2 over the medium term and has started the normalisation process.,True,orientation,True,True
For September we can consider a bigger increase if the inflation outlook persists or deteriorates.,True,disease,True,True
First let me stress that we started responding to inflation several months ago.,True,other,True,True
The current bout of inflation is a global phenomenon although it started to affect Europe a little later than elsewhere which explains why our response has been a little later than in other jurisdictions.,True,disease,True,True
As soon as we saw that inflation was becoming more entrenched we acted swiftly and decisively.,True,warfare,True,True
Unlike in the euro area domestic demand appears to have been a stronger driver of inflation in the United States.,True,machine,True,True
The times ahead wont be easy we will have higher inflation lower growth higher interest rates and higher yields.,True,orientation,True,False
The discussion will be had but our current assessment of the situation where we think the mediumterm inflation outlook is in line with our two per cent target calls for a gradual approach to normalisation.,True,other,True,True
Our roadmap is robust and covers a range of different interpretations of whats going on on one side the view that inflation is exclusively due to a supply shock and on the other the view of those who believe that there is a big domestic demand component.Moving out of negative rates in September makes sense under either interpretation.,True,orientation,False,True
This debate will continue in the autumn and at that point well have more information and will know more about the dynamic of inflation and secondround effects on wages.,True,other,True,True
In the near term directionally there is an upward pressure on inflation and a negative impact on growth.,True,orientation,True,True
In any case we are moving towards a normalisation of monetary policies that were introduced to fight excessivelylow inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
I appreciate that investors want to predict where the neutral interest rate will be but for us as a central bank the important focus is on a pathway where essentially we will be moving rates and then well be simultaneously assessing the inflation dynamic.,True,orientation,True,True
Rates will settle down when inflation settles around two per cent and we should be openminded where that will be.,True,orientation,True,True
As President Lagarde has said we can move more quickly if inflation pressures are high and more slowly if there are downside risks to inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
In the last Governing Council meeting we said that we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate incorporating flexibility if warranted to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
It is weighing on growth and boosting inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And the latest inflation reading showed that energy costs which have risen following the invasion of Ukraine but also following the recovery from the pandemic were 38 higher in April than a year ago.,True,orientation,True,True
Although the unusual degree of uncertainty could mean a combined slowdown in growth amid high inflation the current situation cannot be compared to that of the 1970s.,True,orientation,True,True
At that time the decline in economic growth following the first oil shock was considerable 8 percentage points and inflation was higher than today.,True,orientation,True,True
Moreover back then wage increases in response to inflation fuelled the price growth.,True,fire,True,True
The first rate increase will be determined by the ECB Governing Council informed by the forward guidance it has decided and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True

This is our unwavering commitmentAskECB FrankElderson It is true that the war is weighing significantly on activity but it also pushes up inflation mainly through higher energy prices.,True,orientation,True,True

Tensions have become persistent and more acute inflation is rising while economic activity is showing signs of slowing.,True,orientation,True,True
This makes the choices facing the European Central Bank more complicated as a monetary tightening aimed at containing inflation would end up hampering growth that is already weakening.,True,warfare,True,True
And we should not lose sight of the fact that inflation is being fuelled by international factors that are reducing purchasing power and weakening consumer demand and investment.,True,fire,True,True
Monetary policy has only limited room to affect this imported inflation.,True,other,True,False
The drivers of inflation are global not European.,True,machine,True,True
We can and must prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy which would lead to price increases that we saw as temporary becoming a structural and permanent phenomenon.,True,plant,True,True
We would react decisively for example if we observed a deterioration in inflation expectations or wage increases that were inconsistent with our 2 inflation target over the medium term.,True,disease,True,True
We cannot tame inflation on our own without causing high costs for the economy.,True,animal,True,True
But supporting Ukraine and doing all we can so that the war ends quickly is also the best way to quickly reduce inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Peace would ease tensions in international markets oil gas and food that are driving up inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
This also means coordinating our fiscal measures to contain the costs of imported inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
With mediumterm actual and expected inflation around 2 we can gradually reduce the level of monetary accommodation providing less stimulus to the economy than in the past.,True,other,True,True
Our decisions depend on data on the pandemic the war in Ukraine the global economy especially China and the United States and on how all these factors will impact on inflation demand and production.,True,other,True,True
The task of the central bank is to prevent inflation in the medium term from being inconsistent with the 2 target.,True,other,True,True
Monetary policy intervened decisively guaranteeing favourable financing conditions in all euro area countries and nullifying the deflationary pressures caused by the shock.,True,disease,True,True
Before the pandemic inflation had been low for a long time and was thus not an issue for most people.,False,,False,False
But once a certain threshold is passed inflation suddenly becomes the subject of intense public debate.,True,orientation,True,True
Its true that the current high inflation is mainly driven by energy prices.,False,,True,False
Initial estimates show that inflation in the euro area stood at 7.5 per cent in April slightly higher than in the previous month despite a moderation in energy price inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Core inflation which excludes energy and food climbed strongly to 3.5 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
So we are seeing that inflationary pressures are becoming more broadbased.,True,liquids,True,True
Through the higher cost of imports this has effects on inflation which we are closely monitoring.,True,machine,True,True
There can be no doubt that we will see higher wage demands if inflation remains so high over a prolonged period.,False,,True,False
We need to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in expectations.,True,warfare,True,True
Some factors like digitalisation could continue to weigh on inflation.,True,machine,True,True
But there are other developments such as the green transition and a possible decline in globalisation that are likely to increase inflation over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
And on the other hand you have inflation expectations which we should monitor to make sure they dont rise above our target of 2 over the medium term.,False,,True,False
The invasion of Ukraine will increase inflationary pressures and reduce economic growth.,True,warfare,True,True
In addition both headline and underlying inflation in Spain are back above the European average.,False,,True,False
With these levels of inflation interest rates are not going to be as low as they have been in recent years and governments need to prepare for this.,True,orientation,True,True
The European and Spanish economies will face a complex situation with high inflation a downward trend in growth and smaller company margins.,True,orientation,True,True
If the measures are well designed fiscal policy can help to lessen the impact of an external supply shock like the current one preventing those negative effects for inflation over the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
Our prediction was for growth of a little more than 4 this year and an inflation rate that was clearly on the rise.,True,orientation,True,True
We had underestimated inflation for a period of time.,True,other,True,True
The consequences for inflation are quite clear.,True,other,True,True
The message is crystal clear in this respect well see higher inflation and lower growth.,True,orientation,True,True
If we define it as negative growth yearonyear with very high inflation then even in the severe scenario we do not see stagflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We do not see negative growth yearonyear but inflation is going to be high for the rest of the year.,True,orientation,True,True
If you look at survey and marketbased inflation expectations they are around 2 in the medium term.,True,other,True,False
Whats clear is that in the medium term inflation will be much closer to our definition of price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
We will act depending on the evolution of inflation.,True,plant,True,True
Twothirds of the inflation we are suffering now is due to energy prices so its imported inflation.,True,disease,True,True
Monetary policy can do very little to deal with this kind of inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
The main risk is that this type of inflation starts to be more and more persistent and gives rise to secondround effects.,True,plant,True,True
The longer inflation remains high the higher the possibility of having wage indexation clauses in the collective bargaining process.,True,orientation,True,True
But if we start to observe a deanchoring of inflation expectations and secondround effects then this is going to be a key element for the future of monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
As we've just talked about behind the inflation is this energy shock.,True,warfare,True,True
In the context of a 45 increase in energy costs right now inflation is more than we would like.,True,other,True,True
But the momentum of inflation will slow down so we do think that in the second half to the year as you say the inflation rate will come down.,True,machine,True,True
So that is very important and we think that unlike the 1970s these are a few months of high inflation rates.,True,other,True,True
It is not a decade of high inflation rates and we do think the inflation will fall later this year.,True,orientation,True,True
So please remember this inflation is coming from outside it is not coming from the European economy.,True,orientation,True,True
Behind the overall inflation rate is a 45 increase in energy inflation between this year and a year ago and that's a very large yet another large step increase from the 32 we had last month.,True,orientation,True,True
So what we have to do as the ECB is to analyse the consequences of these very high inflation numbers which operate through a number of channels.,True,liquids,True,True
Of course through inflation dynamics with these high numbers there would be more momentum behind inflation through secondround effects and so on.,True,sports,True,True
But of course for those who were negotiating wages in maybe in January and in February that is before these high inflation rates have picked up yet again.,True,orientation,True,True
But in the end this is why when we especially in our quarterly meetings have a comprehensive assessment and new forecasts essentially this has to be brought together informing our medium term inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
And what we concluded at the March meeting is essentially if the mediumterm inflation outlook remains in a situation where we think inflation will not be falling below our target in the medium term and over the next couple of years as you know our forecast for 2024 was a little bit below the targetat 1.9 in terms of our sequence the first decision will be if the medium term inflation outlook is maintained that we will be looking to end net purchases in the third quarter.,True,orientation,False,True
However if the outlook deteriorates by so much that the inflation outlook weakens then we will have to think again.,True,disease,True,True
And what we have here is opposing forces on the one hand we have the energy shock and the prospect of second round effects are pushing up inflation on the other hand as you say the weakening of sentiment and the fact that real incomes will suffer with the high energy prices and especially so over a one to two year horizon will have a negative pressure on the inflation outlook.,True,warfare,True,True
So today you know this is again highlighting the impact of the war highlighting really levels of inflation we have not seen.,True,orientation,True,True
Remember what we have now is we have policies that that were introduced when we had inflation far below target.,True,orientation,True,True
I think it ultimately remains the case that we now have inflation right now well above target and these considerations you mentioned about possible hits to demand possible slowdowns of the economy to me it's really about the appropriate pace of normalisation.,True,orientation,True,True
But that reflects the fact that we're coming from a situation of having policies that were introduced to fight excessively low inflation and that normalisation coming back towards neutral is a very different concept from a kind of situation of tightening.,True,warfare,True,True
We do have this inflation pressure right now and then we have all the uncertainties of the war.,True,warfare,True,True
29 March 2022 If you go back to last summer we would have had the view that inflation was still essentially subdued and that we were basically in a campaign to bring inflation gradually to the 2 per cent target.,True,warfare,True,True
For that reason right now clearly inflation is a huge issue across Europe absolutely.,True,other,True,True
This is where we would still diagnose that this essentially is an imported inflation shock its a supply shock.,False,,True,False
And for these reasons we would still maintain by the way I dont think its unique to the ECB its the general economics profession that most of this inflation will fade away.,True,other,True,True
Fading away from inflation doesnt mean that these high prices will reverse.,True,other,True,True
But the momentum where every month you wake up and you read that inflation is higher than the previous month that element the momentum element we do think will decline.,True,other,True,True
We do think that inflation will decline later this year and will be a lot lower next year and the year after compared to this year.,True,other,True,True
The current episode is extremely serious requires a lot of change in behaviour but at the same time going back to the very popular analogy of the 1970s we dont see this as a kind of lockedin phase where every year inflation will be high.,True,other,True,True
We do think because its imported inflation that essentially the momentum will level off.,True,other,True,True
It essentially boils down to the diagnosis that the balance between imported inflation and domestically driven inflation is different here.,True,disease,True,True
For example the scale of the fiscal policy injection last year was much bigger in the United States than in Europe and so the ingredients for domestic inflation are simply weaker in the euro area than they are in the United States.,True,plant,True,True
It revolves around the mediumterm inflation since thats the key orientation for monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
One is high current inflation which runs the risk of creating its own momentum through secondround effects.,True,other,True,True
On the other hand if we see a significant downward revision in demand that on its own terms will imply a downward revision for mediumterm inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
In March we had an inflation outlook which was getting close to 2 per cent.,True,other,True,True
So if we see a significant decline in the mediumterm inflation outlook that will be the trigger for revising the net purchase schedule.,True,other,True,True
The commitment is that our monetary policy responses will ensure that in the medium term inflation will stabilise at 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
It will likely lower euro area growth and push up inflation in the short term through higher energy and commodity prices confidence effects and the disruption of international trade.,False,,True,True
In the short term the surge in inflation is due to factors related to the pandemic stoked more recently by disruptions to global energy prices related to the war.,True,fire,True,True
We indicated that if the incoming data support the expectation that the mediumterm inflation outlook wont weaken even after the end of net asset purchases we will conclude net asset purchases in the third quarter.,False,,True,False
If on the other hand the outlook changes and financing conditions deteriorate in a way inconsistent with our two per cent inflation target we stand ready to revise our schedule for net asset purchases in terms of size andor duration.,False,,True,True
It is also important to stress that in all our scenarios inflation is expected to decrease and settle at levels around our two per cent target in 2024.,False,,False,False
Finally the Cypriot economy will be affected by the inflationary pressures from higher energy costs owing to its dependence on oil imports for power generation.,True,other,True,True
The macro risk that is to say the possible consequences for the overall economy higher inflation and slower growth are the greatest risks for the banks too.,False,,True,True
Because if wage increases are too high they can push prices up even more and contribute to persistently higher inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The same goes for inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
On the basis of survey information and market data expectations for the next three to five years are anchored close to our inflation target of 2.,True,other,True,True
We are monitoring developments in inflation very closely.,False,,True,False
One reason for the drop in inflation could be that the significant increase in energy prices cannot last for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
Over the past year we have underestimated inflation as other institutions and economists have too.,False,,True,False
Models have a tendency that projected inflation levels revert to the historical mean.,True,orientation,True,True
If we continue to underestimate inflation we will respond.,False,,True,False
Second round effects and a potential deanchoring of mediumterm inflation expectations will be the deciding factors.,True,other,True,False
Our monetary policy decisions and the available instruments are geared to meeting our inflation target.,False,,True,False
So in terms of inflation there is not just the mechanical effect from commodity prices for the mediumterm outlook the macroeconomic effects need to be incorporated.,False,,False,False
But our strategy is crystal clear we want inflation to stabilise around two per cent in the medium term.,True,other,True,True
First if the mediumterm inflation outlook falls well below our target the ECB must pursue accommodative i.e. loose monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
Second if mediumterm inflation settles above our target we would need to tighten monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
Third if inflation settles around our target in the medium term then a normalisation of monetary policy as we call it would suffice.,True,orientation,True,True
The decisive factor for monetary policy is how inflation develops in the medium term.,True,plant,True,True
If inflation rates are moving towards our target in the medium term which is now looking more likely instead of being well below two per cent as before the pandemic we will adjust monetary policy because we would then for example no longer need to make asset purchases to stabilise inflation at our target over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
If inflation moves close to our target we will phase out quantitative easing.,True,orientation,True,True
But these are not lasting phenomena they belong to the temporary components of inflation.,True,other,True,True
So we are also revising our assessment of the persistence of inflation in this respect.,True,other,True,True
Many of the factors that are now driving inflation rates up will play less of a role in 12 or 18 months.,True,orientation,True,True
We think that most of this inflation will fade away.,True,other,True,True
The impact on inflation will of course depend on how the green transition proceeds and this will be a gradual process.,True,other,True,True
This should be an antiinflationary force as it reduces costs.,True,warfare,True,True
A smaller workforce may translate into higher wages but also less demand in the economy so the net impact on inflation is unclear.,True,other,True,False
When we target an inflation rate of two per cent and expect productivity to grow by one per cent wages in the euro area increasing by an average of three per cent would be consistent with our inflation target.,True,other,True,False
That is a theory of domestically generated inflation.,True,other,True,True
What we have now however is a lot of imported inflation.,True,other,True,True
What we are seeing at the moment is mostly imported inflation through the prices of oil and gas.,True,other,True,True
Both in the United States and in Europe global factors such as the increasing price of oil have a major impact on inflation.,True,other,True,True
The inflation rates are correspondingly higher there.,True,orientation,True,True
Then the key policy rates will only increase above their current levels if the conditions consistent with our mediumterm inflation target are met.,True,orientation,True,True
15 February 2022 Last year we were expecting that the sharp rise in inflation that we've seen in response to the reopening of the economy would subside relatively quickly because base effects were expected to drop out and bottlenecks were expected to be gradually resolved.,True,liquids,True,True
What we've learnt over time is that high inflation is now expected to stay there longer.,True,orientation,True,True
We've had two strong inflation surprises in both December and in January which makes a reassessment of the inflation outlook necessary.,True,other,True,True
In particular it now looks increasingly unlikely that inflation is going to drop below 2 per cent by the end of this year as we had expected earlier.,True,orientation,True,True
All of this implies that it has become increasingly likely that inflation is going to stabilise around our 2 per cent target over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
With the most recent data however the risk of acting too late has increased and therefore we need a careful reassessment of the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
And then we have the direct and indirect effects of oil prices on inflation.,True,other,True,True
We also have to ensure that current high inflation does not become entrenched in expectations because that could then give rise to a wageprice spiral.,True,plant,True,True
So I think we cannot simply look through everything especially if inflation now becomes more broadbased and more persistent than we originally thought.,True,plant,True,True
That has to be seen in the light of the changes to the inflation outlook and the strong labour market.,True,other,True,True
All our monetary policy measures are guided by the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,True
We look at the balance of benefits and costs and I would say that we are getting to a point where in light of the inflation outlook the benefits of further net asset purchases may not justify the additional costs.,True,other,True,True
This decision is linked to the inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
If this were included it would have a substantial effect on measured inflation in particular on core inflation where the weight of owneroccupied housing is larger.,True,other,True,True
For example in the third quarter of last year core inflation would have been 0.6 percentage points higher which is substantial.,True,other,True,False
One outcome of the strategy review was that for the time being our main inflation measure remains the harmonised index of consumer prices.,True,other,True,True
Given that inflation is very high in the energy component and is also high for food low income households who typically spend more on these types of goods are going to be affected more strongly.,True,other,True,True
It is concerning that current high inflation is particularly painful for those households in the lower income category.,True,disease,True,True
But there is very little we can do about current high inflation.,True,other,True,True
This is why we look at mediumterm inflation.,True,other,True,True
And there we have to find the right balance between acting too early meaning that we could choke the recovery or acting too late which could lead to high inflation becoming entrenched which would also have a substantial cost.,True,plant,True,True
But at the same time once inflation expectations are deanchored it can be very costly to reanchor them.,True,machine,True,True
We currently see inflation figures increasing and we are taking that into account in our projections.,True,orientation,True,True
So even if only for that reason inflation will slow down.,True,orientation,True,True
We have not yet reached the goal of durably stabilising inflation at our target of two per cent over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
But if high current inflation threatens to lead to a deanchoring of inflation expectations we may still need to respond as our mandate is to preserve price stability.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Thank you for your kind words.,True,orientation,True,False
The implications of the green transition for inflation are very important for monetary policy.,False,,True,False
Have a lookhttpsecb.europa.euecbclimatehtmlindex.en.htmlAskECB My speech on monetary policy and green transition is available herehttpswww.ecb.europa.eupresskeydate2022htmlecb.sp2201080425a24eb7.en.html Isabel_Schnabel The empirical link between money growth and inflation has weakened over recent decades.,False,,False,False
In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time asset classes and jurisdictions at any time.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Monetary policy has to keep a watchful eye on all factors including energy that affect the mediumterm inflation outlook.,False,,True,False
An extended period of high energy price inflation may lead to expectations of higher inflation in the future.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Our economies will benefit from a faster transition to renewable energy sources.,False,,True,True
There is a risk that inflation continues to rise in the near term but it is likely to gradually decline towards the end of this year.,True,orientation,True,True
There remains high uncertainty around the inflation outlook.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel In the 1970s rising oil prices triggered a harmful pricewage spiral as inflation expectations drifted away.,True,disease,True,True
Today longerterm inflation expectations are wellanchored.,True,machine,True,True
We will ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Projections are always surrounded by uncertainty.,False,,True,True
But due to the pandemic and structural changes the uncertainty around the inflation outlook is unusually high.,True,other,True,True
This means an inflation rate of 2 over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Since the introduction of the euro average inflation in the euro area has amounted to 1.7.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Transitory supply shocks drive inflation and growth in opposite directions.,False,,False,False
Thats why central banks can usually look through their impact on inflation both for upside and downside deviations from target.,False,,False,False
The ECB has proven its willingness to act if needed and as appropriate.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel The monetary policy statement contained important changes regarding the upside risks to inflation and the need for optionality.,True,other,True,True
The process of normalisation will be datadependent and gradual avoiding unnecessary disruptions.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Financing conditions must remain in line with inflation stabilising at our target over the medium term.,False,,False,False
We are ready to adjust all our tools to make sure that inflation stabilises at our 2 objective over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
What matters for inflation is the growth in wages over and above productivity growth.,True,other,True,True
We carefully monitor wage developments as they are crucial for the inflation outlook.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Negative rates reflect the low inflation environment before and at the beginning of the pandemic.,False,,False,False
We continuously evaluate the monetary stimulus required for inflation to stabilise at our 2 target in the medium term.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel We take peoples concerns about rising prices very seriously.,True,orientation,True,True
You and all EU citizens can trust us that we will use all our instruments to stabilise inflation at our 2 target in the medium term.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel We need to minimise the risks of both acting too late and acting too early.,True,orientation,True,False
Besides supply shocks we have to assess the strong developments in the labour market and their implications for mediumterm inflation.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Cash will stay an important way to pay and it is also a tangible symbol of European integration.,False,,False,False
Our actions will continue to be guided by our price stability objective.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel If there is a risk that inflation expectations become unanchored we need to take action even if the shock is exogenous.,True,orientation,True,True
Currently longerterm inflation expectations remain wellanchored.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Due to the pandemic and structural changes in the economy uncertainty around the inflation outlook is unusually high.,True,other,True,True
If we judge that inflation will remain above our target over the medium term the ECB will adjust its monetary policy as appropriate.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel The economy is recovering.,True,orientation,True,True
The progress made towards our 2 inflation target over the medium term permits a stepbystep reduction in our asset purchases.,True,orientation,True,True
We will reassess the implications of the incoming data for the inflation outlook in March.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel For a long time euro area inflation was below our target but it is now moving towards 2 in the medium term.,False,,False,False
Current inflation is painfully high mostly due to high energy prices.,True,disease,True,True
We will ensure that it will not persist over the medium term.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel We know that high inflation causes significant hardship for people who bear the rising costs of food housing and transportation.,True,disease,True,True
We will make sure that inflation stabilises at our 2 target over the medium term.AskECB Isabel_Schnabel Inflation has risen mainly due to energy prices which we cannot affect directly.,False,,False,True
But we are seeing that inflationary pressures are broadening and becoming more persistent.,True,liquids,True,True
In the first year 2020 inflation was relatively low.,False,,True,False
In the second half of 2021 inflation turned out to be quite high.,True,orientation,True,False
And then as we look into this year 2022 we think inflation will remain high at the start of this year but will fall later this year especially towards the end of the year.,True,orientation,True,True
So it's a year essentially where in the first part of the year we'll still see inflation remaining high.,True,orientation,True,True
We are clear from our December forecast that we expect inflation in overall terms for this year to be around 3.2 per cent in the euro area and then to be below 2 per cent in 2023 and 2024.,False,,False,True
We will see exactly the timing of how quickly inflation falls.,True,orientation,True,True
So rather than focus on month by month we have a clear vision in terms of the overall direction that the inflation rate will fall later this year.,True,orientation,True,True
And in fact as you know our current view from December is that inflation will fall below the 2 per cent target in the next couple of years.,True,orientation,True,True
I think we are always clear that were guided by our intentions to deliver an inflation rate of 2 per cent over the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
You've given me a hypothetical the hypothetical is what happens if inflation is above our forecast.,False,,False,False
So let me in turn make clear that what is very important is whether inflation will essentially settle at around our target of 2 per cent which would be essentially what we want or whether there might be signs of inflation being above 2 per cent in a significant way for a significant amount of time.,False,,True,True
And if we saw the data coming in to suggest that inflation would be too high relative to 2 per cent then of course we would respond.,False,,True,False
Because remember in the euro area for inflation to be around 2 per cent and allowing for a typical increase in labour productivity of about 1 per cent then wages should be growing around 3 per cent a year in the euro area on average to be consistent with the 2 per cent target.,False,,False,False
One scenario is in fact that the forces that generated low inflation before the pandemic essentially become visible again after the pandemic.,True,other,True,True
So one scenario is that the world economy will return to quite low inflation rates.,True,orientation,True,True
So that is a kind of middle scenario where inflation will stabilise at 2 per cent.,False,,True,False
And then the third scenario is if inflation picks up and there is a risk that inflation will be significantly above 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
In this third scenario where inflation is significantly above 2 per cent on a persistent basis then that will call for a monetary policy tightening.,True,orientation,True,True
In the middle scenario where inflation stabilises at 2 per cent then clearly over time we would normalise monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
The policies we need to fight very low inflation would no longer be needed if inflation were stable around 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
And in the first scenario where inflation is significantly below 2 per cent then the policies that we have employed to fight low inflation would still remain relevant.,True,orientation,True,True
One we remain with a low inflation problem.,True,disease,True,True
Two we stabilise in a kind of smooth way inflation around 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
And three if inflation turns out to be persistently above 2 per cent we would have to tighten.,True,orientation,True,True
In the December round of projections the assessment was that in fact we saw inflation returning to below 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
But in the euro area context I would say that it's also possible that we may enter a world where inflation stabilises around 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
I find it less likely to think about a scenario where inflation is persistently significantly above 2 per cent which would require a serious tightening.,True,orientation,True,True
And we fully understand many peoples worries about the drop in real wages and interest income all the more so as people on lower incomes are hit particularly hard by higher inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
We expect that inflation will fall significantly over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
The current rate of inflation wont be affected only the future one.,True,other,True,False
Most forecasts our own and others indicate that the surge in inflation caused by the pandemic will be followed by a marked decline.,True,liquids,True,True
In our projections mediumterm inflation will even fall back below our target of 2 even though we acknowledge that the projections are now subject to great uncertainty.,True,orientation,True,True
But we will act quickly and decisively if we conclude that inflation may settle above 2.,True,other,True,True
And these surveys do indeed show upward risks with respect to inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The prices of petrol and heating fuel for example are now increasing significantly with the result that perceived inflation is higher than actual inflation.,True,other,True,True
We have an inflation calculator onour websitewhich allows people to discover their individual inflation rate.,True,other,True,True
In addition when calculated over a longer period inflation has not increased as much as suggested by latest figures.,True,other,True,True
If one compares prices today with prices two years ago one sees that average annual inflation in Germany in December was just 2.5 as prices actually fell in the first year of the pandemic.,True,orientation,True,True
First we steer inflation for the entire euro area.,True,machine,True,True
At an average rate of 0 some Member States would be experiencing deflation which economists see as very harmful.,True,disease,True,True
Second a slightly positive inflation target facilitates economic adjustment processes geared to preserving competitiveness.,True,machine,True,True
It enables a reduction in real i.e. inflationadjusted wages.,True,other,True,True
This would imply that other goods and services would also become more expensive and wages would start rising which could lead to a more persistent increase in inflation.,True,other,True,True
There are ongoing debates about the impact of the green transition on inflation.,True,other,True,True
If it leads to higher inflation monetary policy needs to react under certain circumstances.,True,other,True,True
This is especially the case if higher inflation threatens to become entrenched in peoples expectations or if the green transition triggers an economic boom that in turn leads to rising prices.,True,warfare,True,True
11 January 2022 In our December projections we assessed that inflation at the end of 2021 including in the month of December was going to be high.,False,,True,False
But we also believe that inflation will fall this year and that it will go below our 2 per cent target in 2023 and 2024.,True,orientation,True,True
We are looking beyond the inflation we have right now monetary policy is based on the medium term.,False,,True,False
The 5 per cent inflation number in December is unusually high.,False,,True,False
But we do not see behaviour that would suggest inflation will remain above our target into the medium term.,False,,True,False
This goes back to our December assessment that inflation will not only fall this year but will settle below our target in 2023 and 2024.,True,orientation,True,True
But let me focus on one element we have a crosscheck to raise interest rates we need to see sufficient progress in underlying inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The pandemic makes it more difficult to interpret indicators of underlying inflation.,True,other,True,True
It will take some time to filter out the effects of the pandemic base effects supply bottlenecks and so on and to have a proper assessment of what is going on with underlying inflation.,True,other,True,True
We have highlighted on a regular basis that the central element in understanding underlying inflation is to find out what happens to the trend in wages.,True,other,True,True
But a significant move in the persistent and underlying source of inflation is unlikely unless you see wages picking up quite a bit.,True,orientation,True,True
Until now the wage data do not indicate any major acceleration in underlying inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
In the United States and the United Kingdom the assessment is that inflation will not stabilise at the target of around 2 per cent unless there is a monetary policy tightening.,True,orientation,True,True
The discussion about monetary tightening there depends on the assessment that inflation will remain above target then monetary tightening is considered necessary.,True,orientation,True,True
Our assessment for the euro area is different inflation is expected not only to go back to the target but also to fall below the target therefore our monetary policy reaction is different.,True,orientation,True,True
It is important to recognise the pervasive impact of the pandemic on inflation.,True,other,True,True
In 2020 we had low inflation or even disinflation.,True,orientation,True,False
And this was one of the motivations for us to react with the pandemic emergency purchase programme PEPP inflation was too low.,True,orientation,True,True
The ECB has a symmetric view too high inflation and too low inflation are equally undesirable.,True,orientation,True,True
We have a lot of special factors that are leading to unusually low inflation in 2020 and unusually high inflation in 2021.,True,orientation,True,True
The high pressure on inflation in 2021 will be fading this year but 2022 is still part of the pandemic cycle.,True,other,True,True
And when the pandemic is over in 2023 and 2024 inflation will stabilise at a lower level at about 1.8 per cent which is much closer to our target compared to what we had before the pandemic.,True,orientation,True,True
The economic recovery in 2023 and 2024 in the euro area will bring inflation closer to our target.,True,orientation,True,True
A second point is that the inflation element could be incorporated in the fiscal framework fiscal policy has a bigger multiplier when interest rates are low and when inflation is low.,True,other,True,True
We are clear in our strategy our monetary policy and our balance sheet is driven by price stability and by what is needed to stabilise inflation at our 2 per cent target.,True,orientation,True,True
Weve been clear in recent weeks and months that there is a peak of inflation at the end of 2021.,True,orientation,True,True
The pandemic in 2020 the first year led to unusually low inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And now in 2022 we have a third leg of this pandemic episode where we do think this year inflation is going to come down.,True,orientation,True,True
Its going to be above where we want it to be in the long term but this threeyear period 2020 2021 2022 is basically part of a pandemic cycle in inflation.,True,other,True,True
Only a few weeks ago in our December meeting we looked at the prognosis for this year for 2023 2024 and our analysis is that inflation will be coming down in 2022.,True,orientation,True,False
And in fact we project inflation to be a little bit below our target in 2023 and 2024.,True,orientation,True,True
So yes when we hear numbers like 5 per cent in December 2021 that sounds so strange after a long period of low inflation but again to repeat we do think that the inflation pressures will be easing over the course of this year.,True,disease,True,True
And in fact we think inflation in 2023 and 2024 will be a little bit below where we would like it to be in terms of our target.,True,orientation,True,True
So that meant inflation in 2020 was unusually low.,True,orientation,True,True
When those VAT cuts were reversed in 2021 it means in 2021 inflation was temporarily high.,True,orientation,True,True
In 2022 we dont have that VAT effect so that kind of a mechanical effect which means that even this month of January 2022 inflation will be lower down from December for that very simple reason.,True,machine,True,True
We always when we look at inflation recognise there are risks on both sides.,True,orientation,True,True
There are risks that inflation could be above our forecasts but also risks that inflation could be below our forecasts.,True,orientation,True,True
So of course there is a lot of attention to be paid to the scenario of inflation being above our forecast And we will be monitoring the situation and I think I've repeatedly said actually that the most important element of what we need to look at is whats going to happen to wage behaviour over the course of this year.,True,other,True,True
So let me generalise this point of course we have to think about it in terms of the inflation consequences but the European economy is a major importer of energy.,True,other,True,True
Weve just had that discussion that there are forces on either side in relation to energy inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And were crystal clear that strategy is we're intent on delivering inflation stabilised at 2 per cent in the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
So anything that threatens inflation above 2 per cent over the medium term we will be responding to.,True,warfare,True,True
Equally any force that threatens to push inflation below 2 per cent we will also respond to.,True,warfare,True,True
So any monetary policy move we take today would mostly show up in the inflation data in 2023 and 2024.,True,other,True,True
Less so in 2022 because inflation takes a while to respond to monetary policy.,True,other,True,True
So durably means it would be essentially a mistake to respond to inflation thats high in 2022 but below target in 2023 and 2024.,True,orientation,True,True
And that is essentially the notion of durability unless we think the inflation pressure is going to remain above 2 per cent in 2023 and 2024 it would be a mistake to tighten policy in response to inflation thats high right now.,True,disease,True,True
And essentially what we need to look at is is there any sign of todays high inflation becoming embedded in expectations?,False,,True,False
Because of course if people expect the inflation rate of 3.2 per cent in 2022 to persist in 2023 2024 and beyond then it may change pricing behaviour wage behaviour in a selffulfilling way.,True,disease,True,True
So that is really the criterion are we seeing inflation persistent inflation being converted into actions into new types of wagesetting behaviour pricesetting behaviour?,True,disease,True,False
And so if inflation is temporarily above target people understand its not going to last.,False,,True,False
Thats very different to if inflation lets say the 3.2 number we have today.,True,other,True,True
All agree with us in the sense of believing that more likely than not inflation in 2023 2024 will be below our target not above our target.,True,orientation,True,True
And again to repeat we do think inflation in 2022 will be temporarily above our target.,True,orientation,True,False
But we do think inflation is going to come down below our target in 2023 and 2024.,True,orientation,True,True
We try to be super clear about the criteria we use in making interest rate decisions and going over what we talked about when we think the high inflation is not going to be durable the case for altering our interest rate policy is not there.,True,disease,True,True
22 December 2023 We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2.,False,,True,False
We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services.,False,,False,False
We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2 by 2025.So we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.,True,sports,True,True
We must go the last mile we have an inflation target of 2.,True,sports,True,True
All of this affects our core business the fight against inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then owing to the pandemic and Russias war of aggression against Ukraine quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.,True,other,True,True
After the great inflation of the 1970s monetary policy changed fundamentally.,True,other,True,True
But there have also been macroeconomic trends particularly globalisation and Chinas entry into the world market which played an important role and brought down inflation.,False,,False,True
Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2.,False,,False,False
And these could turn out to be inflationary even though that is hard to predict.,False,,True,True
A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well.,False,,True,False
But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.,True,disease,True,True
The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB.,True,warfare,True,True
We sharply increased interest rates within a short time and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations.,True,machine,True,True
It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We target inflation not the price level.,True,warfare,True,True
Also in the past it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.,True,other,True,True
But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
21 December 2023 A year ago inflation was above 10 and now it is below 3.,False,,True,False
Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade and because monetary policy is taking effect.,True,orientation,True,True
This means that unit labour costs are rising which adds to inflationary pressures.,True,other,True,True
This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.,True,plant,True,True
We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2 target.,False,,False,False
Almost all income indicators have returned to their prepandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation.,False,,True,True
Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do which is bring inflation down.,True,orientation,True,True
And when economic activity is dampened inflation slows.,True,fire,True,True
Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2 monetary policy might then start to ease.,True,orientation,True,True
If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation but to achieve growth other factors must be brought into play.,True,sports,True,True
Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly.,True,orientation,True,True
Most importantly underlying inflation which has proven more stubborn is now also falling more quickly than we had expected.,True,orientation,True,True
All in all inflation developments have been encouraging.,True,other,True,True
That said despite these positive developments I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely.,True,warfare,True,True
Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2 target.,True,machine,True,True
This period of belowpotential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2 no later than 2025.,True,orientation,True,False
If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process.,True,machine,True,True
Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year.,True,orientation,True,True
After more than two years of abovetarget inflation we need to err on the side of caution.,True,orientation,True,True
If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2 target in a sustainable manner.,True,machine,True,True
According to our staff projections the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame.,True,machine,True,True
Transmission is working lending growth is slowing the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing.,True,machine,True,True
But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum.,True,machine,True,True
This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained.,True,machine,True,True
The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.,True,other,True,True
Theres first likely going to be an uptick in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
So this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now.,True,orientation,True,True
And most importantly we need to see whats going to happen to underlying inflation to wage growth to productivity to unit profits.,True,other,True,False
This is what we aim for to push down inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.,True,orientation,True,True
Indeed changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated.,True,other,True,True
But that's a matter for Eurostat not the ECB and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward.,True,other,True,True
A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not.,True,other,True,False
9 November 2023 It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2 level we define as price stability.,True,orientation,True,False
The evolution of inflation has been positive overall it was above 10 only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9. At the same time core inflation has also been moderating.,True,orientation,True,True
But we have to be prudent and cautious as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months.,True,other,True,True
Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
At the same time we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation.,True,other,True,True
Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025 with some fluctuations caused by base effects.,True,orientation,True,True
However we believe that if interest rates are maintained at their current levels inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.,True,orientation,True,True
As regards inflation the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.,True,other,True,True
Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was.,True,orientation,True,True
There are always differences in inflation and growth but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries.,True,other,True,True
Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries.,True,other,True,True
It is essential to focus on core inflation for which there are several risks.,True,other,True,True
First there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation.,True,other,True,True
Second there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation.,True,other,True,True
Let me add that its not only the origin of inflation thats important but also the possibility of secondround effects which can make the situation much more complicated with a possible pricewageprofit spiral.,True,other,True,True
In particular we need to avoid deanchoring inflation expectations as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.,True,other,True,True
This was part of the ECBs strategy review and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation.,True,other,True,True
Including the cost of owneroccupied housing in the measurement known as the owneroccupied property cost contributes to the calibration of inflation.,True,other,True,True
Going back even further to the era of quantitative easing you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis.,True,disease,True,True
However sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge and we had to respond.,True,disease,True,True
Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability.,True,other,True,True
We are determined to bring inflation down to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
When we measure inflation we pay attention to the headline rate which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car food on the table or to have clothes shelter and everything else.,True,other,True,True
16 October 2023 First in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation so the role for monetary policy was immediate.,False,,False,False
Now would increasing rates a little earlier say in March have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022?,False,,True,False
But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation.,False,,False,False
And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock as is also visible in our surveys of consumers.,False,,False,False
The current interest rate of 4 will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down especially as theres still more tightening in the pipeline.,True,machine,True,True
Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year.,True,sports,True,True
But to allow inflation to return to 2 we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024.,True,orientation,True,True
We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different.,False,,True,False
This will also keep the bond markets calm since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively they would demand higher interest rates.,True,warfare,True,True
The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2 because then the interest rate on longterm bonds would be far higher than it is now.,True,orientation,True,True
Because inflation is too high we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range.,True,orientation,True,True
If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent we have to be open to doing more.,True,disease,True,True
We think inflation will return to 2 by 2025.,True,orientation,True,True
So its going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates.,True,orientation,True,True
Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range.,True,orientation,True,True
We do not think that inflation will revert to prepandemic levels.,True,orientation,True,True
This is also reflected in studies and market prices which indicate that once inflation is conquered interest rates will probably return to around 2.,True,warfare,True,False
We made a whole range of calculations but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did.,True,other,True,True
Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2 in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary.,True,orientation,True,True
The health crisis was followed by Russias unjustified war in Ukraine and then by an acceleration in inflation.,True,machine,True,True
The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that maintained for a sufficiently long duration will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.,True,orientation,True,True
They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation.,True,fire,True,True
The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections.,True,other,True,True
And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world apart from in China.,True,orientation,True,True
A very worrying situation resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6 in October 2022 more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3. That means that within one year the efforts made along with base effects i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago have slowed the pace of inflation.,True,machine,True,True
To this end we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area as well as underlying inflation excluding energy and food.,True,machine,True,True
High and persistent inflation affects peoples purchasing power.,True,disease,True,True
But overall while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.,True,orientation,True,True
We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.,True,orientation,True,True
The goal is obviously not to create a recession but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and above all prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral.,True,plant,True,True
We want to get inflation back to 2 and we will achieve that.,True,orientation,True,True
This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2 over the coming years.,True,orientation,True,False
6 October 2023 Overall the recent news on inflation is encouraging.,False,,True,False
Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably and it now stands at 4.3 after peaking at 10.6 in October of last year.,True,orientation,True,True
A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly.,True,orientation,True,True
When it comes to core inflation which excludes energy and food it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5 in the euro area hence above headline inflation.,True,other,True,True
However its September print was lower than expected.It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly but it is still well above our target of 2 which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored.,True,orientation,True,True
Given the persistence of underlying inflation that last kilometre may well prove to be the hardest.,True,sports,True,True
The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on because we could have new supply side shocks stemming for instance from energy or food prices.,True,orientation,True,True
In addition the base effects from energy may eventually reverse putting upside pressure on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Thereforewe must not be complacent and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.,True,warfare,True,True
Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2.,True,other,True,False
This will depend on the data so we will continue to look at three factors the inflation outlook the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.,True,other,True,True
But I still see upside risks to inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation.,True,other,True,False
There are several reasons for the large role played by energy First countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
Second governments responded differently to the energy price shock with some governments imposing price controls which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on.,True,other,True,True
One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices which constitute a large share of the consumption basket.,True,other,True,True
Measures that directly control prices such as price caps have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run which may be reversed once the measures are lifted.,True,liquids,True,True
This helps to smooth inflation over time but it also distorts the steering effect of prices.,True,machine,True,True
In the short run they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers as these often depend on current developments in inflation.,True,other,True,True
Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control.,True,other,True,True
As inflation falls real incomes are rising which supports economic growth going forward.,True,orientation,True,True
What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics.,True,machine,True,True
It is through such secondround effects that inflation becomes more persistent.,True,other,True,True
How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation particularly underlying inflation will be going forward.,True,other,True,True
We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures.,True,fire,True,True
This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term.,True,other,True,True
What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner.,True,other,True,True
That is then also embedded in inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly anchored around our target in spite of painfully high inflation rates.,True,orientation,True,True
Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2 in a timely manner.,True,other,True,True
But there are other factors behind that for instance the impact of inflation on households disposable income and the evolution of exports which is related to the slowdown in the global economy.,True,other,True,True
The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy and indirectly to inflation.,True,machine,True,True
That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates if maintained over time will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.,True,plant,True,True
We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy.,True,disease,True,True
If the transmission is much closer to completion then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.,True,machine,True,True
But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.,True,disease,True,True
First of all progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way.,True,orientation,True,True
We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent.,True,other,True,True
First lets look at the factors in favour of disinflation.,True,other,True,True
Now lets turn to factors against disinflation.,True,other,True,True
So when you put all this in the balance our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months.,True,orientation,True,True
But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.,True,warfare,True,True
We have said it very clearly we consider that with the decisions weve made and on the basis of our current assessment the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
Of course there are upward risks to inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Climate change could also lead to a shift in longerterm inflation dynamics but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Some aspects are certainly inflationary 2022s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67 compared with the year before for example so thats rather significant.,True,other,True,True
We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments and we will weigh any incoming data carefully as always in relation to our inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
Based on todays assessments we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target.,True,orientation,True,True
22 September 2023 Well I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year.,False,,True,False
So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure.,True,orientation,True,True
And essentially this autumn there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes.,True,orientation,True,True
So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025.,True,orientation,True,True
That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge.,True,other,True,True
And this is why this rate of 4 per cent we think is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.,True,orientation,True,True
And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot but we're also I think loud and clear saying number one this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is there's going to be a lot of data points not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.,True,orientation,True,True
You would expect a central bank if we saw the inflation assessment going off track if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed of course we would do more.,True,orientation,True,True
It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic we would do more.,True,disease,True,True
And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back.,True,orientation,True,True
So it is going to be I think a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
But as incomes go up and remember you know basically from this point forward we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
This monetary tightening which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago.,True,warfare,True,True
It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target which absolutely does slow down the economy.,True,orientation,True,True
It's a very unusual disinflation episode.,True,other,True,True
This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer.,True,other,True,True
We are concerned about food prices the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate.,True,machine,True,True
Of course in any given month the change is relatively small but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation.,True,other,True,True
So goods inflation and services inflation came down which is very welcome.,True,orientation,True,True
So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn.,True,orientation,True,True
But let me summarise that as the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall which remains high but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation which is a welcome development.,True,orientation,True,True
Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash the detailed inflation data dont come out until the middle of the month.,True,other,True,True
But what is really important some of the conjectures about the summer whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries services inflation remains significant but the fact that there was some easing I think helps to limit that narrative.,True,other,True,True
But what I would say is that after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year we will be keeping an eye on this situation.,True,orientation,True,True
Essentially what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023 with further progress in 2024 and in 2025.,True,orientation,True,True
And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic where its a multiyear process so 10 per cent inflation doesnt collapse to 2 per cent very quickly but the direction of a significant drop this year Its already halved from 10 to 5 with further progress expected this year.,True,orientation,True,True
That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors.,True,other,True,True
That inflation again does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent.,True,orientation,True,True
Its sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is timelimited its temporary and therefore you should not change your longerterm behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high.,True,other,True,True
We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode.,True,other,True,True
Its not going to disappear overnight but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation weve seen into a longerterm projection.,True,other,True,True
I think the history of price controls is that ultimately its not going to be the best way to fight inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies for example in the 1970s that essentially once they are lifted a lot of the suppressed pricing reemerges.,True,other,True,True
I think theres a distinct debate and let me emphasise that its distinct which has played out in countries like France for example which is that it is not price controls but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase.,True,other,True,True
In turn if you limit the intensity of inflation then you may weaken secondround effects.,True,other,True,True
But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like I dont think wed see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.,True,other,True,True
Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and as we talked about earlier on we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it.,True,orientation,True,True
Number one the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse.,True,other,True,True
If you have a high inflation rate even if you expect it to ease over time and a very low interest rate that creates a lot of proinflationary incentives.,True,other,True,True
So to avoid proinflationary behaviour its important that interest rates go up enough.,True,other,True,True
We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been I think several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low because that dynamic would have taken over.,True,other,True,True
One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low when inflation is going to be high on a multiyear basis could have led to this kind of procyclicality which would make life even worse.,True,other,True,True
Because we know that if inflation gets embedded it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time this famous phrase of titfortat inflation.,True,other,True,True
This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means as I said earlier that firms know they have to limit their price increases and workers can be confident that because inflation is contained their loss of living standards is not so much at risk.,True,other,True,True
If you fed a model with a larger more persistent energy shock it would produce more inflation.,True,other,True,True
Theyre well able to design a nonlinear model theyre well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their onceayear revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently of what happens similarly if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock and therefore for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits they need much bigger wage increases than normal.,True,other,True,True
In the end those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation but nowhere near the scale weve had.,True,other,True,True
And I would say that over this year the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation but its going to be a multiyear process.,True,orientation,True,True
Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought.,True,other,True,True
Essentially this damage to supply has to be proinflationary.,True,other,True,True
So the net impact on inflation and therefore the role of monetary policy is maybe relatively contained.,True,other,True,True
If you look at for example the IMFs World Economic Outlook from last October essentially that was one of the big messages the inflation effect is there its not zero but basically it is relatively limited.,True,other,True,True
But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list.,True,other,True,True
As I mentioned to you I dont think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero but because it operates both on demand and supply its relatively contained.,True,other,True,True
Then if I turn to right now let me emphasise we have a cyclical inflation problem not a longterm inflation problem.,True,other,True,True
Because if we did not do that then people I think would build their expectations that inflation would basically become deanchored and then those tenyear rates would go up.,True,other,True,True
What I would say however is that were midway through this inflation adjustment.,True,orientation,True,True
What I outlined here earlier on is this vision this narrative is a multiyear perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target.,True,orientation,True,True
Much will depend on our basic assessment that the conditions are there both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years.,True,orientation,True,True
30 July 2023 We have covered a lot of ground and have made great progress in this fight against inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
We will only know when we have reached this goal a mediumterm inflation target of 2 by looking at the economic and financial data.,False,,True,False
The key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to the 2 mediumterm target.,True,orientation,True,True
We are committed to returning inflation to our target in a timely manner and for this we need a sufficiently restrictive policy in terms of level and length.,True,orientation,True,True
Our aim is to lower inflation and our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
The ideal solution which is known as a soft landing is a moderate lowering of activity in tandem with a significant fall in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And its essential to keep sight of the objective of lowering inflation and to be as clear as possible about the tools deployed and the intended results.,True,orientation,True,True
The decline is being driven particularly by the fall in energy price inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And monetary policy has clearly begun to have an impact on lowering inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
We pay close attention to the inflation felt by our fellow citizens and also look very carefully at the mechanisms underlying inflation in order to analyse the root cause of the price increase.,True,disease,True,True
In other periods owing to competition and a smaller gap between supply and demand firms absorbed some of the costs and reduced their margins.This time the increases in wages which represent a catchup and the rises in unit profits are feeding inflation.,True,animal,True,True
If you look at inflation expectations and the wage increases negotiated collectively and individually there is no sign of a wageprice spiral emerging.,True,plant,True,True
In similar crises wages have caught up with inflation typically over a period of around three years.,True,orientation,True,True
But inflation is still higher than our mediumterm target of 2 and according to our staff projections is set to remain so in 2024 and 2025.,False,,False,False
The recent period of high inflation was not accompanied by a reduction in firms profit margins which even increased in some cases particularly when demand for goods and services outstripped supply.,False,,False,False
In the current context it is important to know whether firms are going to reduce their margins a little to meet their employees expectations of higher wages and to restore some of their purchasing power which is what has normally happened during previous high inflation episodes or whether we are going to see a twofold increase in margins and in wages.,False,,False,False
A simultaneous increase in both would fuel inflation risks and we would not stand idly by in the face of such risks.,True,fire,True,True
25 June 2023 Last week we published our growth and inflation projections.,False,,True,False
In turn dampening demand will lower inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
Our projections show that headline inflation in the euro area is clearly declining.,True,orientation,True,True
However underlying inflation stripping out energy and food is projected to reach more than 5 this year mainly driven by unit labour costs.,True,machine,True,True
This is essentially what explains our higher underlying inflation projection.,False,,True,False
In the medium term headline and underlying inflation will no doubt decline but we havent yet reached our price stability target.,True,orientation,True,True
If this slows down so will inflation.,True,machine,True,True
So far we have raised rates by 400 basis points and can already see the impact this is having but we need to ensure that inflation converges and holds at around 2 our price stability target.,True,orientation,True,True
What happens with underlying inflation is paramount.,True,other,True,True
Fiscal policy must also play a part if we are to reduce inflation.,True,other,True,True
But Spains underlying inflation is now in line with the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
One could even say that Spain provides a leading indicator for future inflation in the euro area.,True,orientation,True,True
Inflation in Spain initially rose at a faster pace than in the euro area but has subsequently slowed more sharply whereas underlying inflation has proved to be much stickier than the euro area average.,True,orientation,True,True
The current inflation scenario cannot be understood without taking into account the wave of shocks that have hit Europe the pandemic the reopening of the economy and Russias invasion of Ukraine.,True,warfare,True,True
The priority now is to bring down inflation because of its very negative impact on social wellbeing.,True,orientation,True,True
It is very difficult for economic growth and stability to coexist with high inflation.,True,other,True,True
The possibility of combining high inflation with high growth vanished with the series of supply shocks that we have seen.,True,warfare,True,True
If we are to resume strong growth inflation must come down.,True,orientation,True,True
If that were the case inflation would not drop as expected and a stronger monetary policy response would be called for.,True,orientation,True,True
With climate we now understand that higher temperatures can lead to higher prices ultimately feeding into higher inflation.,True,animal,True,True
Without healthy soils its the same thing there will be lower crop yields which may have an impact on prices and inflation.,True,plant,True,True
And this is where it could get into the realm of monetary policy of price stability and of inflation.,True,other,True,True
Headline inflation in the euro area has come down relatively quickly after hitting a peak of 10.6 in October of last year.,True,orientation,True,True
However underlying inflation which excludes volatile food and energy prices Ed. is more persistent and remains high with services playing a key role due to the relatively strong impact of wage costs on inflation in these sectors.,False,,False,False
Rising food prices are also driving inflation but we expect food inflation to fall in view of the global slowdown in agricultural commodity prices.,False,,True,False
According to our March projections inflation will return to our 2 target only in 2025.,True,orientation,True,True
This would mean abovetarget inflation for around four years a very long time.,False,,False,False
One important question is how this may affect inflation expectations of businesses and households and hence firms price setting and wage negotiations.,False,,False,False
Wage agreements can have a prolonged effect on inflation due to their long duration.,False,,True,False
Thats why it is so important to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored at our target and bring inflation back to 2 percent as quickly as possible.,False,,True,False
If one looks at the drivers of domestic inflation both wages and corporate profits have recently played an important role.,False,,True,False
The Russian invasion of Ukraine stoked inflation further.,True,fire,True,True
It is difficult to say how inflation would have evolved without the war.,False,,True,True
Our interest rate decisions are datadependent and are based on three elements the inflation outlook the evolution of underlying inflation and the transmission of our monetary policy to the economy.,False,,False,False
Staff analysis suggests that monetary policy transmission is proceeding and that the impact of our tighter monetary policy on inflation is expected to peak in 2024.,False,,False,False
Given the high uncertainty about the persistence of inflation the costs of doing too little continue to be greater than the costs of doing too much.,True,other,True,True
The reason is that once inflation has become entrenched in the economy it becomes much more costly to fight it.,True,warfare,True,True
Let me be very clear A peak in underlying inflation would not be sufficient to declare victory we need to see convincing evidence that inflation returns to our 2 target in a sustained and timely manner.,True,warfare,True,True
Fiscal policy in the euro area as a whole is still expansionary and this fuels inflationary pressures.,True,fire,True,True
We have been stressing for some time now that governments should focus on expanding the supply capacity of the economy in order to boost productivity through education infrastructure the labour market Ed. That would help dampen inflation.,True,fire,True,True
Our inflation target is defined over the medium term so we must be forwardlooking.,False,,True,False
Moreover the risk of a deanchoring of inflation expectations is often not captured by the models.,False,,True,False
This may partly reverse the process that we have seen when China entered the world market which raised global supply and competition and gave western firms the opportunity to offshore activities and profit from Chinas lower wage costs Ed. thereby creating downward pressure on inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
I expect that this will lead to higher inflationary pressures through three channels.,True,liquids,True,True
The effect that this will have on inflation is still subject to a lively debate.,True,other,True,True
Weve seen in the past decade that ageing societies have tended to save more and spend less which dampens inflation.,True,fire,True,True
Changes in the labour market could also have a significant impact on inflation with a decline in people of working age pushing up wages unless countered by higher immigration.,True,other,True,False
Past experience shows that such developments typically dampen inflation by raising productivity.Considering all of those structural forces together I would tend to see structurally higher inflation pressures in future.,True,fire,True,True
We are not even thinking about thinking to change our inflation target.,False,,True,False
We will bring inflation back to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
In less than a year we have raised interest rates decisively from 0.5 to 3.25 and inflation is falling as confirmed by yesterdays data.,True,orientation,True,True
It takes several quarters before its effects are fully felt by the real economy and then transmitted to inflation.,True,disease,True,True
Our March projections suggest that inflation should hover around 3 early next year and approach 2 in 2025.,True,orientation,True,True
Investors understand that inflation has risen because of a series of adverse global shocks that are beyond the control of monetary policy.,True,orientation,True,True
They know that we will intervene until we see inflation heading convincingly towards our 2 target and they expect it to return to that level.,True,orientation,True,True
So far we haven't succeeded but not because of the reasons suggested by commentators in 2021 who predicted a sharp rise in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Without these unpredictable events the economic landscape would be quite different with significantly lower inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Imagine the potential fallout had we not acted decisively the risk of falling into a prolonged recession and of deflation which could have led to an economic depression was real.,True,orientation,True,True
We are now addressing the inflationary consequences of these shocks and our actions should be measured against our success in curbing inflation.,True,disease,True,True
Core inflation does not accurately represent the typical consumption basket especially for lowincome consumers.,True,other,True,False
More importantly as I have said in the past it is not a good leading indicator for future headline inflation.,True,other,True,True
Core inflation usually lags behind headline inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
And just as it has lagged behind energy inflation on the way up it is now proving to be persistent even after energy inflation has gone down.,True,orientation,True,True
Our rate increases aim to prevent inflation from taking root for too long.,True,plant,True,True
There is substantial scope for fighting inflation by keeping rates high for as long as necessary.,True,warfare,True,True
We should be resolute yet judicious with the aim of lowering inflation without unnecessarily harming economic activity.,True,orientation,True,True
14 May 2023 Our mandate is price stability and tightened monetary policy is a response to the very high inflation we face.,True,orientation,True,True
Hikes of 50 and 75 basis point were extraordinary steps in response to extremely high inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
We have had to raise rates by 375 basis points it was an important stage in our journey and inflation is in fact coming down.,True,orientation,True,True
And on the path of inflation headline and core.,True,orientation,True,True
Energy prices will be key in determining headline inflation.,True,machine,True,True
But core inflation will also be telling.,True,other,True,True
It is a useful indicator for predicting inflation over the medium term.,True,machine,True,True
In this regard I am concerned about service prices which account for a large share of core inflation.,True,other,True,True
We need to closely observe the impact of wages and services on core inflation.,True,other,True,True
10 May 2023 There are factors that can induce significant upside risks to the inflation outlook.,True,orientation,True,False
And we are still in a situation where uncertainty about the path of inflation is high so we have to be extremely attentive to those potential risks the exact list of which you will find in our latest monetary policy statement in particular in relation to wage increases in various European countries.,True,orientation,True,True
But we have to be attentive and energy remains one of the uncertainties that can affect future output as well as inflation numbers.,True,other,True,True
Our reaction function will be anchored in the inflation outlook the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission and this will dictate our decisions going forward.,True,orientation,True,True
Headline inflation is the measure that we target and that we have agreed will determine whether or not we deliver price stability.,True,warfare,True,True
We do however look at measures of underlying inflation.,True,other,True,True
Core is one such measure but there are also others for example those that exclude more volatile items or focus more on domestic inflation pressures.,True,other,True,True
And why do we filter inflation in that way?,False,,True,False
Its to arrive at the heart of inflation the most persistent element in those price indexes that can help us understand where headline inflation is likely to settle in the medium term.,True,other,True,True
Thats a good way to identify in real time whether our policy action is actually biting and whether we see supporting evidence that yes we have attacked inflation hard enough.,True,warfare,True,True
So we have moved in a very deliberate and decisive way in order to fight inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
What I know is that we are determined to tame inflation to bring it back to our 2 mediumterm target in a timely manner and we have made a sizeable adjustment already.,True,animal,True,True
If you look at for instance Latvia and compare it with Malta you are talking about completely different inflation rates.,True,other,True,True
In the long run if our economies rely more substantially on renewable energies the impact will be disinflationary.,True,other,True,True
Inflation has been above our target since the middle of 2021 so inflation has been too high for almost two years.,True,orientation,True,True
And the longer inflation stays too high the greater the risk that peoples perceptions will change that they will lose faith in our ability to return to our 2 target.,True,orientation,True,True
That is not the case at the moment but its why we want to return inflation to 2 in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
Sticky would mean that inflation will remain where it is.,True,other,True,True
There are many phenomena underlying the current inflation figures.,True,other,True,True
I dont think we are in a 1970sstyle situation when inflation was in fact sticky.,True,other,True,True
That is why its important that the ECB raises its interest rates to ensure inflation returns to 2 in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
And second if fiscal policy injects less stimulus into the economy inflationary pressures will be lower over the coming years.,True,liquids,True,True
As a result inflation will return to our 2 target more quickly meaning interest rates would not need to rise more than necessary.,True,orientation,True,True
But after that even when inflation has returned to our target of around 2 financial markets are not expecting interest rates to return to the very low levels we had before the pandemic.,True,orientation,True,True
24 April 2023 Let me start with my general view on recent inflation developments.,False,,True,False
We are seeing a change in the drivers of inflation.,False,,True,False
What happens to inflation is going to depend on the relative importance of these different factors.,False,,True,False
Headline inflation is coming down relatively quickly due to the sharp decline in energy price inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
But core inflation continues to surprise on the upside.,True,orientation,True,True
Given the persistence of underlying inflation plus the very strong momentum in food inflation it's far too early to declare victory on inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
People talk a lot about a potential peak in core inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
I would not overemphasise the peak as such because what really matters is that inflation is returning to our two percent target over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
We need to see a sustained decline in core inflation that gives us confidence that our measures are starting to work.,True,orientation,True,True
The data we have so far shows that inflation is higher and the economy more resilient than projected.,False,,True,False
So far core inflation has continued to move up.,True,orientation,True,True
I think it's quite likely that core inflation is going to peak over the coming months but its not clear that that is going to happen very soon.,True,orientation,True,True
If core inflation is reaching a peak but it remains very high and very persistent the information content of that data point may be relatively limited.,True,orientation,True,True
This is going to have an impact on global growth and hence on inflation.,False,,True,False
I can see that geopolitical fragmentation has an impact on monetary policy to the extent that it affects the natural rate of interest r and inflation.,False,,True,False
On inflation the entry of China into the world economy was a key disinflationary factor over the past decades.,True,other,True,True
If that reverses the effect on inflation could also reverse.,False,,True,False
Fragmentation could also lead to higher pricing power of firms which could drive up inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
On the other hand higher productivity growth if it were to materialise could have a disinflationary effect.,True,other,True,True
In the short run the recovery in China has a direct impact on our projections although I dont expect it to fundamentally change the inflation outlook.,False,,True,True
Financial crises are disinflationary.,True,other,True,True
It will depend on the inflation outlook every week we have more information coming in on the March inflation number that just came out and we will have the April inflation number as well before we meet in May.,True,other,True,True
Number two we have to diagnose the underlying dynamic not just the overall inflation rate but our assessment of how quickly inflation is going to fall.,True,disease,True,True
Conversely the main concern would be if we assessed that inflation was going to remain too high for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
Then the third factor is how quickly these interest rate increases are restricting the economy and bringing down inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Are we seeing signs that inflation is cooling?,False,,True,False
Are they leading to lower investment lower consumption lower pressure on the economy and therefore lower inflation?,False,,True,False
If they create more inflation concerns that will move us in one direction if they create less inflation concerns that will move us in another direction.,True,orientation,True,True
The overall price of energy the mix between oil gas and electricity is of course a big part of the inflation dynamic.,True,other,True,True
But please remember the reason why we are raising interest rates now is because inflation is high.,True,orientation,True,True
In order to make sure that inflation comes back to a low number to around our 2 target we do think its necessary its unavoidable to make these interest rate increases.,True,orientation,True,True
If we did not do this if we kept rates too low we think inflation would remain too high for too long and this would not serve anyone.,True,orientation,True,True
Its important for us at the ECB to make sure that the interest rate policy responds to the inflation challenge.,True,warfare,True,True
And for those who are expressing these concerns Im sure they share my conviction that all of us need to see inflation come back down to a low number around 2 as soon as possible.,True,orientation,True,True
Here and elsewhere those that suffer most from high inflation are those on low incomes who right now are facing very high food prices and still absorbing the increase in electricity and gas prices last year.,True,disease,True,True
Its in everyones interest not to allow inflation to remain too high for too long.,True,orientation,True,True
1 April 2023 After months of fretting about whether workers rising pay would keep inflation uncomfortably high central bankers in Europe have another concern large company profits.,False,,True,False
Companies that push up their prices above and beyond what is necessary to absorb higher costs could be fueling inflation that central bankers need to combat with higher interest rates a policymaker at the European Central Bank warned suggesting that governments might need to intervene in some situations.,True,fire,True,True
Although inflation in Europe has begun to ease from last years doubledigit peaks the rates remain far above 2 percent the target of most central banks.,True,orientation,True,True
There has been a similar phenomenon in the United States where companies reported wide profit margins last year despite the highest inflation in four decades.,True,other,True,True
Some producers could be exploiting supply bottlenecks or taking advantage of this period of high inflation which makes it more challenging for customers to be sure of the cause of price increases.,True,other,True,True
Im not here to pass a judgment on how fair or unfair pricesetting is Mr. Panetta insisted but rather to explore all of the causes of inflation.,True,other,True,True
So this is enough to be worried as a central banker that there could be an increase in inflation due to increasing profits.,True,other,True,True
The average rate of inflation for the 20 countries that use the euro has been falling for five months to 6.9 percent over the year through March but core inflation which excludes volatile energy and food prices a measure used by policymakers to assess how deeply inflation is embedding in the economy has continued to rise.,True,plant,True,True
Central bankers tend to focus on the risk that jumps in pay will lead to persistently high inflation especially in Europe where wages tend to change more slowly than in the United States.,True,other,True,True
As inflation persists attention has turned to corporate profits.,True,other,True,True
In Britain Mr. Bailey told companies to bear in mind when setting prices that inflation was expected to fall.,True,orientation,True,True
Across the Atlantic last year Lael Brainard who was then the vicechair of the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested that amid high profit margins in some industries a reduction in markups could bring down inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
In Europe companies were able to protect their profit margins last year from high inflation more than expected Marcus MorrisEyton a European equities analyst at Allianz Global Investor said.,True,other,True,True
In the eurozone the annual rate of food inflation rose to 15.4 percent in March.,True,orientation,True,True
It should be clear to producers that strategies based on high prices that increase profits and inflation may turn out to be costly for them he said.,True,other,True,True
One thing is clear inflation is too high and we have to bring it down.,True,orientation,True,True
In view of the prevailing outlook with inflation remaining far too high that decision is as robust today as it was when we took it.,True,orientation,True,True
That being said it is true that given the uncertain impact of recent market tensions on the inflation outlook we didnt indicate any specific intentions about future decisions as we had done in the past.,True,other,True,True
There are three elements the inflation outlook based on our analysis of the incoming economic and financial data the underlying inflation dynamics and the strength of monetary policy transmission.,True,other,True,True
In other words we are not preempting the decisions we will take in the future but we remain committed to ensuring that inflation returns to our 2 target in the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
However it was clear that inflation was still far too high and keeping it in check is our primary objective.,True,orientation,True,True
But you have to differentiate between the illness which is inflation and the medicine which is the interest rate hikes.,True,disease,True,True
And in this case if high inflation becomes entrenched it will be the people who are already suffering the most that will end up paying the price.,True,disease,True,True
Our latest projections which were finalised in early March foresee headline inflation at 2.1 towards the end of 2025 and core inflation a little higher at 2.2. These projections are based on technical assumptions with a cutoff date of 15 February and therefore do not take into account recent market developments.,True,other,True,True
If it becomes entrenched the high inflation we are experiencing in the euro area will inflict substantial damage on the economy and mainly affect the most disadvantaged.,True,disease,True,True
And our primary tool to fight inflation is interest rates.,True,warfare,True,True
Restrictive monetary policy lowers inflation by removing excess aggregate demand.,True,other,True,True
This leads to some economic slowdown in the short term but in the medium and long term society as a whole benefits when inflation eases.,True,other,True,True
In line with the elements of our reaction function that I already mentioned we will see how restrictive we need to be and for how long in order to achieve our inflation target.,True,other,True,True
Those grounds to cover would not only depend on how market tensions evolve but also on underlying inflation convincingly turning the corner.,True,orientation,True,True
Second the measures must be temporary and targeted because they could generate more inflationary pressures if these conditions arent met.,True,warfare,True,True
Number one is behind the increase in interest rates is the fact that inflation rose quite quickly.,True,orientation,True,True
In the context of inflation rising that quickly it would have been a surprise if interest rates did not also go up relatively quickly.,True,orientation,True,True
Nowbecause of high inflation we needed to do more.This is why weve brought rates above their longrun value of about 2 per cent now to 3 per cent and weve signalled they will go higher if needed.,True,orientation,True,True
The origin of the low interest rates was inflation that was too low and the origin of the rising interest rates now is that inflation is too high.,True,orientation,True,True
So I think what you described there is essentially a reflection of the actual issue that inflation rose quickly.,True,orientation,True,True
And it is clear as daylight that high inflation emerged because of the pandemic and because of the war in Ukraine.,True,orientation,True,True
Of course it is our job here at the ECB to make sure now that inflation comes down quickly to 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
No. Between summer 2021 and February 2022 when the invasion started we had very strong goods inflation because of the pandemic and supply bottlenecks.,True,disease,True,True
So we had three factors driving inflation at the beginning of 2022 bottlenecks the war and energy prices and the reopening of Europe.,True,machine,True,True
The inflation were seeing stemmed from these unusual factors.,True,plant,True,True
Finding the solution to that inflation thats our job.,True,other,True,True
Wages will rise on the other hand but our overall assessment is a rapid decline of inflation at the end of this year.,True,orientation,True,True
We are in fact probably in the most intense phase of inflation.,True,disease,True,True
So right now we still have this intense inflation pressure.,True,disease,True,True
Under our baseline scenario in order to make sure inflation comes down to 2 per cent more hikes will be needed.,True,orientation,True,True
No. If this financial stress weakens the economy it would automatically reduce the inflationary pressures.,True,disease,True,True
So far rising wages have not been an important source of inflation.,True,plant,True,True
We expect wages to go up more quickly as unions react to the high inflation of last year.,True,orientation,True,True
But its very important for everyone workers firms to recognise that inflation will be much closer to 2 per cent next year and in 2025.,True,orientation,True,True
The wageprice spiral is a scenario which happened in the 1970s when expectations became entrenched that inflation would be high every year.,True,plant,True,True
Remember under this forecast inflation is coming down to 2.8 per cent at the end of this year and then continuing to improve towards our goal of 2 per cent.,True,orientation,True,True
Similarly new indicators and data on headline inflation had been quite positive since October.,True,other,True,True
The projections released last week were more optimistic on growth and inflation.,True,other,True,True
Nevertheless growth numbers werent great hovering around 1 per cent while inflation was clearly more positive especially headline inflation.,True,other,True,True
And perhaps this will feed through to the economy in terms of lower growth and lower inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
We want a timely return to 2 per cent inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
But the trajectory of inflation is much more important than just touching the 2 per cent target.,True,orientation,True,True
Headline inflation will decline quite rapidly over the next six to seven months as the base effects play in favour of a rapid reduction in inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
In that respect core inflation is going to be key.,True,other,True,True
It is very difficult to converge towards the 2 per cent target in a sustainable way without a clear decline in core inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
So those are the three elements that will help reduce headline inflation.,True,other,True,True
These measures may be positive and reduce inflation in the shortterm but once they start being withdrawn in 2024 the opposite effect can be expected.,True,other,True,True
All in all I am positive about the decline of headline inflation but we need to look very carefully at the evolution of core inflation.,True,orientation,True,True
There will be a disinflationary process over the coming months.,True,machine,True,True
But to reach our target core inflation must also start to decelerate too.,True,machine,True,True
First I would point out that headline inflation has gone down in recent months and will continue to decline in the next few months.,False,,True,False
Core inflation which in the euro area excludes energy and food is too high.,False,,True,False
In Spain where this indicator also includes processed food it stands at 7.7. The way forward is clear we have to continue to take the measures needed to bring inflation back to 2.,False,,False,False
The ECB doesnt have a ceiling but an inflation target of 2.,False,,True,False
That is the mediumterm inflation target which is how price stability is defined for us.,False,,True,True
My main concern is inflation.,False,,True,True
Our goal is to tame inflation.,True,animal,True,True
Raising interest rates dampens demand and reduces inflationary pressures.,True,liquids,True,True
I know that people are suffering from inflation particularly the most vulnerable and those who are most exposed pensioners with low incomes.,False,,True,True
But when rates rise as they have had to in order to tame inflation monthly payments increase.Im sure many banks are ready to negotiate in order to ease the burden on households over time.,True,animal,True,True
It is in the banks interest to do so because they know that when inflation is under control interest rates will ultimately go down.,True,animal,True,True
But I am confident that headline inflation will go down in 2023 while core inflation will be stickier in the near term.,False,,True,False
And we will do whatever is needed to return inflation to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
I see our action as being more sustained because inflation is a monster that we need to knock on the head and keep at 2.,True,animal,True,True
Inflation indexation has not helped us in the past and has generally contributed to fuelling inflation that had got out of control.,True,fire,True,True
The issue were facing now is that we have inflation that is too high and interest rates that are being raised to keep it under control.,True,animal,True,True
The worstcase scenario for a central bank is that a prolonged phase of high inflation causes the public to lose confidence that price stability in practice a 2 percent inflation target will be maintained over the medium term.,True,orientation,True,True
If the public comes to believe that inflation will remain high on an indefinite basis this would be baked into price and wage setting and become selfsustaining.,True,plant,True,True
So it is essential that monetary policy is clearly set to make sure that inflation returns in a timely manner to our 2 percent target.,True,orientation,True,True
This has been especially important over the last year given that monetary policy had been previously geared for several years to address a persistent belowtarget inflation pattern.,True,machine,True,True
So we have been moving in a sustained manner away from a superaccommodative monetary stance toward a stance that is sufficiently restrictive to make sure inflation returns to target and thereby keeps longerterm inflation expectations anchored.,True,orientation,True,True
At the same time I think it should be recognized that the twin forces of the pandemic and the warrelated surge in energy prices constituted extraordinarily large and asymmetrical shocks that were bound to generate an initial phase of high inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
It is certainly true that it warrants ongoing examination to assess whether the ECB and other central banks could have done a better job in assessing the size and duration of this inflation shock.,True,warfare,True,True
These programs have always had the primary focus on ensuring that the long end of the yield curve contributed to the monetary easing that the overall economy needed to avoid prolonged belowtarget inflation these were not programs to directly finance governments.,True,machine,True,True
The poor are the hardest hit by persistent inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
Accordingly it is in our collective interest that the ECB maintains a primary focus on the timely return of inflation to our 2 percent target.,True,orientation,True,True
Such a supply shock is better for GDP and should also lower the inflation rate.,False,,True,False
The improvement in the energy price situation will in the near term lower inflation and boost GDP.,False,,True,False
But the supply shocks on net lower inflationary pressures.,True,machine,True,True
Our assessment of December remains solid that we needed a sequence of 50 basis point hikes to bring us inside a zone where we would need to think harder about whether rates are sufficiently restrictive to deliver the return of inflation to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
One element is our inflation projections and here I mean the whole path not just the end point.,True,orientation,True,True
The second is progress in relation to underlying inflation and the third is an assessment on how powerfully and how quickly monetary tightening is working.,True,other,True,True
On underlying inflation we also need to look at actual outcomes because forecasting techniques are limited which is even more true now given the volatility and the shocks weve seen.,True,other,True,True
So were all signed up to the criterion that sufficient progress in underlying inflation is important.,True,other,True,True
Typically step one in assessing inflation is to take out energy and food because these are usually more volatile.,True,other,True,True
The higher headline inflation is the more pressure there will be on the cost of living on wage inflation and other elements which go into core inflation since underlying inflation is heavily influenced by headline inflation.,True,other,True,True
Food inflation is very significant.,True,other,True,True
As for core inflation its difficult to overstate the importance of recognising that the drivers of goods inflation and services inflation are quite different.,True,other,True,True
Looking at core inflation as an aggregate is not super helpful and I think we need to look at the dynamics of goods inflation and services inflation in a more granular way.,True,other,True,True
For energy food and goods theres a lot of forwardlooking indicators saying that inflation pressures in all of those categories should come down quite a bit.,True,other,True,True
The fact that these are turning around including through the easing of bottlenecks and global factors suggest that there will be significant reductions in inflation rates for energy food and goods.,True,other,True,True
There are two big questions about services inflation.,True,other,True,True
One is the interconnection with wage inflation because a lot of service sectors are quite labourintensive.,True,other,True,True
So the supplyside component of services inflation should ease.,True,other,True,True
And goods inflation in the United States is off quite a bit.,True,other,True,True
There is also room for core inflation to fall if unit profits normalise in those sectors.,True,other,True,True
Theres a lot of forwardlooking indicators which suggest that inflation is going to fall.,True,orientation,True,True
Is it the case that these extraordinary unit profits have room to narrow because of an extra year of adjustment to the reopening the dampening of demand and the scale of momentum in wage inflation?,True,other,True,True
Lets say inflation starts to fall in line with the forecast.,True,orientation,True,True
If we settle into our durable plateau of interest rates it will not be the case that in the first month of a significant fall in core inflation we would need to immediately start revising our plan.,True,orientation,True,True
We should have a strong focus on underlying inflation dynamics which is not the same concept as core inflation.,True,other,True,True
We should also recognise that underlying and headline inflation are not independent.,True,other,True,True
If there is a big decline in headline inflation that will reduce pressures for wage increases because the number one theme in wage bargaining right now is compensating workers for the high inflation that has already happened.,True,other,True,True
If headline inflation is coming down that improvement or less bad news about the cost of living will lower pressure for high wage increases going into 2024.,True,orientation,True,True
This is fundamental and I dont think theres a contest between underlying inflation and headline inflation.,True,other,True,True
If it is deemed that the inflation forecast hasnt improved enough or were not seeing sufficient progress in underlying inflation or we think the monetary transmission mechanism is working too slowly then you can say with a set of conditional statements that a higher rate will be desirable.,True,other,True,True
The overall philosophy is that we will bring rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive which depends on where the inflation forecast is where we are with underlying inflation and where we are with the monetary transmission mechanism.,True,other,True,True
There is a universal conviction that when inflation is stabilised at 2 we are not going back to the prepandemic scenario of super low level of interest rates and quantitative easing.,True,other,True,True
But I absolutely sign up to the monetary policy philosophy that wherever we get to we should be slow to come down until we have very strong evidence not just in the forecast but also in our ongoing assessment of underlying inflation that we are returning inflation to target.,True,orientation,True,True
The fact that in 20082012 Europe had a lot of financial distress which was definitely disinflationary doesnt mean we think that is how monetary policy should work.,True,other,True,True
This is where the progress in underlying inflation is going to matter in addition to the forecast.,True,other,True,True
One the most important one is what is the risk to our inflation target of 2?,True,other,True,True
We look at scenarios such as whether inflation expectations get deanchored or a wageprice spiral gets embedded.,True,other,True,True
You can definitely come up with plausible scenarios for inflation that doesnt come back to 2 quickly enough.,True,other,True,True
The scenarios where inflation falls below 2 you can put some weight on them.,True,orientation,True,True
But thats fixable in the sense that if the inflation dynamic weakens more quickly then we can adjust.,True,machine,True,True
But in the upside scenario where inflation doesnt come back quickly enough then the longer it remains high the more it becomes normalised and then we have a significant problem.,True,orientation,True,True
27 February 2023 My predecessors and many central bankers around the world had to fight deflation and they had to adjust policy as a result of that.,True,warfare,True,True
We will do more hikes if necessary to return inflation to our target of 2 in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
What I know is that we will return inflation to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
We need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 and to keep rates there for as long as necessary to be confident that inflation returns to 2 in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
In order to fight inflation we want that our interest hikes are passed through to the financial sector including to banks.,True,warfare,True,True
Headline inflation is still unacceptably high but it is likely to decline because energy costs are falling.,True,orientation,True,True
Core inflation inflation without energy and food prices is currently still at its highest level ever in January it was 5.3 for the euro area as a whole.,True,orientation,True,True
But one thing is sure we want to bring inflation back to 2 in a timely manner.,True,other,True,True
Our decisions will be determined by the incoming data and driven by our goal of returning inflation to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Most economists and forecasters initially anticipated that high inflation would be transitory and temporary and that it would fade away.,True,disease,True,True
However inflation spread into a much broader range of products and services.,True,disease,True,True
But the current environment of high inflation is different.,True,other,True,True
If anything we should have maybe identified some inflation movements a little earlier and not have assumed that there were too many transitory aspects to it.,True,other,True,True
Neither on the energy front nor on the inflation front.,True,warfare,True,True

17 February 2023 We are still far away from claiming victory on inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
A broad disinflation process has not even started in the euro area.,True,machine,True,True
If we look at underlying inflation in particular we are seeing that it is very high and more persistent than headline inflation.,True,disease,True,True
Underlying inflation developments play an important role in our thinking.,True,other,True,True
We are already seeing that the drop in energy prices is feeding into headline inflation and eventually it will also feed into underlying inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
The passthrough from lower energy prices to core inflation may be slower than on the way up but eventually it is going to happen.,True,liquids,True,True
What is more important when it comes to mediumterm inflation is the development of wages and profits.,True,other,True,True
It is expected to be around 4 to 5 in the years to come which is too high to be consistent with our 2 inflation target even when taking productivity growth into account.,True,other,True,True
So wage developments are going to be key for our assessment of underlying inflation and therefore also for inflation over the medium term.,True,other,True,True
Finally both price and wagesetting depend on inflation expectations.,True,other,True,True
Through our determined action we have been able to keep inflation expectations anchored.,True,orientation,True,True
We are seeing longerterm inflation expectations broadly anchored at 2.,True,orientation,True,True
But wage growth has to be consistent with inflation returning to 2 and thats what we need to monitor.,True,orientation,True,False
That said it is highly unlikely that inflation pressures are going to vanish all by themselves.,True,disease,True,True
The attractor of headline inflation over the medium term is core inflation which is why it matters so much for our monetary policy.,True,machine,True,True
We have defined our target in terms of headline inflation but we know what drives headline inflation over the medium term is core inflation.,True,machine,True,True
Given the current level of policy rates and the level and persistence of underlying inflation a rate hike by 50 basis points is necessary under virtually all plausible scenarios in order to bring inflation back to 2.,True,orientation,True,True
The second stage is from financing conditions to aggregate demand and the third stage is from aggregate demand to inflation.,True,machine,True,True
The answer is until we see robust evidence that inflation and in particular underlying inflation is going back to our target of 2 in a timely and durable manner.,True,orientation,True,True
A turning point in underlying inflation is not sufficient because this turning point is likely driven by the gradual passthrough from lower energy prices to underlying inflation rather than the more persistent components.,True,orientation,True,True
Over the medium term inflation will mainly be driven by wage and profit developments.,True,machine,True,True
They assume inflation is going to come down very quickly toward 2 and it is going to stay there while the economy will do just fine.,True,orientation,True,True
That would be a very good outcome but there is a risk that inflation proves to be more persistent than is currently priced by financial markets.,True,disease,True,True
And there the answer is that the green transition in my view can never work in an inflationary environment when there is a risk that inflation is getting out of control.,True,disease,True,True
We have seen how much uncertainty is created by high inflation.,True,other,True,True

24 January 2023 Our December projections foresaw inflation above our 2 target until mid2025.,False,,True,False
Given that inflation had already been high for some time this triggered a further monetary policy adjustment.,False,,True,True
Today we are fighting toohigh inflation and to do so we can bring rates as high as we deem appropriate to reach our target.,True,warfare,True,True
The first is the economic and inflation outlook we will react to mediumterm inflation remaining above our target.,False,,True,False
The second is the risks surrounding this outlook today mainly related to the possible emergence of secondround effects we want to prevent a deanchoring of inflation expectations or the start of a wageprice spiral.,True,disease,True,True
The December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections foresee that inflation will drop sharply from 8.4 in 2022 to 3.6 by the end of 2023 mainly reflecting lower energy prices.,True,orientation,True,True
In 2024 and 2025 projected inflation remains above target for two main reasons.,False,,False,False
A good part of the upward revision of the December inflation projections for 2024 and 2025 reflects the fact that the pricebased measures taken and announced by governments are expected to curb energy prices and inflation in 2023 when they are introduced.,False,,False,False
But they are expected to have the opposite effect when they are withdrawn likely in 2024 pushing inflation up with carryover effects in 2025 delaying the return to our target.,True,orientation,True,True
The effect on inflation is in good part due to the fact that most of these fiscal measures are not limited to vulnerable population groups but rather provide generalised support that is on balance inflationary.,True,other,True,True
Governments may decide to revise their measures for instance by moving towards incomebased targeted support to vulnerable citizens to avoid those undesirable oscillations of inflation.,True,liquids,True,True
This could make an important difference for monetary policy reducing the cost of bringing inflation down.,True,orientation,True,True
We had some good news on the inflation front as it is likely that the supply shocks that have hit the economy in recent months are starting to reverse.,True,warfare,True,True
Energy inflation might abate further if the recent fall in wholesale electricity and gas prices which have so far declined by more than we had assumed in December is sustained and reflected in retail prices which typically takes a while.,True,orientation,True,True
Lower energy prices are unambiguously good news good for the economy and good for inflation.,True,other,False,False
They bring down realised inflation and contain the loss in real income reducing the risks of secondround effects and supporting economic sentiment.,True,disease,True,True
It will take time and we may see ups and downs but some positive signs on the inflation front are emerging.,True,orientation,True,True
For example the seasonally adjusted threemonth inflation rates which capture the latest dynamics of inflation have decreased in recent months as regards not only headline but also core inflation.,True,other,True,True
We need to continue closely monitoring the economic and inflation outlook.,True,other,True,True
Inflation is still too high but recent developments suggest that we can fend off the risks of secondround effects and bring down inflation by continuing to adjust our policy rates in a wellcalibrated nonmechanical way.,True,warfare,True,True
We should do all that is necessary to bring inflation down to 2 without undue delay at the minimum cost to the economy.,True,orientation,True,True
It is important to emphasise that countries with higher debt both those with high public debt and those with high private debt benefit the most from a credible fight against inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
After all it is precisely in these countries that low inflation leads to low compensation for inflation risk the inflation risk premium and thus also low yields on bonds.,True,other,True,True
Theres a large global component to inflation.,False,,True,False
For me the way to differentiate these narratives is that before the pandemic we had five years of low interest rates but little inflationary pressure.,False,,True,False
So the idea that the world we lived in was creating an inflationary environment just doesnt ring true.,False,,True,False
We did have very large quantitative easing and very low interest rates and this did limit the disinflationary pressure keeping inflation in the eurozone at around 11.5 per cent rather than allowing outright deflation.,False,,False,False
But we were not creating inflationary pressure.,False,,True,True
So I dont see that todays inflation came out of excessively loose monetary policy.,False,,True,True
If we had kept rates super low for too long these might have translated into selfsustaining inflation.,True,machine,True,True
Thats why we have moved away from low interest rates and quantitative easing over the last number of months when this inflation shock turned out to be fairly large and quite durable.,True,disease,True,True
So weve proven we are responsive and weve also proven our determination to deliver our inflation target.,True,warfare,True,True
In the same way that we were active in fighting belowtarget inflation we also have to be active in fighting abovetarget inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
US inflation is clearly more of a textbook case in that a lot of inflation is coming from the demand side.,False,,True,False
We have a more complicated situation in the euro area because a lot of the inflation is connected to a negative terms of trade shock.,False,,True,True
We have declining real incomes and falling real wages and a big supply component to the inflation.,False,,False,False
Regardless of where the inflation comes from one has a risk of secondround effects in which high inflation gives rise to upward pressure on wages and profit markups.,True,disease,True,True
The fact that we have a negative real income shock in Europe which the US does not have because its an energy exporter as well as an importer means that the scale of monetary policy tightening needed to adjust inflation to target is smaller in the euro area than in the US.,True,disease,True,True
We both have a 2 per cent inflation target.,False,,True,True
We also have to take into account the downward pressure on inflation from tightening by other central banks around the world which generates weaker demand for our exports and lower import prices.,True,orientation,True,True
For me there are three regimes one inflation chronically below target two inflation more or less on target and three inflation above target.,False,,True,True
Before the pandemic we in the eurozone had inflation at around 1 per cent for many years.,False,,False,False
And that can be selfsustaining because expectations would rationally be that inflation remains below targeted in that scenario.,True,machine,True,True
The inflation shock has proven that inflation is not deterministically bound to be too low.,True,disease,True,True
So if expectations have now reanchored at our 2 per cent target compared to being well below it interest rates will go to the level consistent with that target not back to the superlow rates we needed to fight belowtarget inflation.,True,warfare,True,True
One is that in the prepandemic period some of the antiinflationary forces were coming from globalisation.,True,warfare,True,True
There were also the antiinflationary effects of the deleveraging and fiscal austerity after the global financial crisis and European sovereign debt crisis.,True,warfare,True,True
This means that inflation is going to be more sensitive to domestic slack and less to global conditions.,False,,True,False
It has reminded the world that inflationary shocks can happen.,True,disease,True,True
If we go back to a year and a half ago most of the distributions of inflation expectations were below 2 per cent.,False,,True,False
As you know expectations have a strong effect on mediumterm inflation and as a consequence on steadystate interest rates.,True,other,True,False
So yes absolutely I dont think the chronic lowinflation equilibrium we had before the pandemic will return.,True,disease,True,True
Were not yet at the level of interest rates needed to bring inflation back to 2 per cent in a timely manner.,False,,True,False
Let me go back to one thing you said earlier on mechanical base effects mean that we do have inflation coming down a lot this year.,True,machine,True,True
So for Q4 2023 our projection of inflation back in December 2022 was that we would be at around 3.6 per cent.,True,other,True,False
So what I would also say is that because we havent had so many tightening cycles in recent memory another source for uncertainty is that the sensitivity of inflation to interest rates varies a lot across the different models we run.,True,machine,True,True
In turn that will help us decide how powerfully the interest rate hikes are affecting the real economy and the inflation dynamic.,True,machine,True,True
The second level is that over the past year there has been a significant change in the nominal and inflationary environment.,True,other,True,True
If it turns out that inflation is much stickier than expected that theres more of a downturn in the world economy that higher interest rates have to be higher than is currently expected by the market we will be keeping a perpetual eye on financial fragility.,True,disease,True,True
One is whether after this period of high inflation the 2 per cent inflation target will be seen as credible by people in general.,True,other,True,True
I think monetary policy can deliver that by making sure inflation comes back to 2 per cent in a timely manner.,True,orientation,True,True
But then there is the second part which is the implications for nominal assets and what assets people may wish to hold and what one means by the safety of safe assets after this inflation surprise?,True,other,True,True
Before the pandemic we had a negative inflationrisk premium.,True,other,True,True
Interest rates were low not just because inflation was below target but the risk distribution was seen as skewed to the downside.,True,orientation,True,True
We would now expect to see an inflation risk premium being more substantial.,True,other,True,True
And we may see more of an inflationary risk premium maybe more demand for indexlinked products and so on.,True,other,True,False
The direct impact of fiscal policy is to lower inflation right now.,True,other,True,True
But in our projections it is expected to raise inflation in 2024 and 2025 when these subsidies are scheduled to be removed.,True,other,True,True
One is how fiscal policy is currently lowering inflation through subsidies followed by the reversal of those subsidies later on.,True,other,True,True
Theres a lot of value in the stability of the inflation target.,True,other,True,True
So for me at this point maintaining an exclusive focus on 2 per cent as the inflation target is the best strategy.,True,other,True,True
23 April 2024 The battle isnt over but we have notched up several important victories along the road to disinflation.,True,warfare,True,True
We have gone from 10 headline inflation to 2.4. Core inflation is also falling and is now below 3.,True,orientation,True,True
Looking beyond geopolitical risksthe largest remaining threat stems from inflation in the services sector mainly driven by wages.,True,disease,True,True
And we will need to take into account whats happening in the United States where inflation is higher.,True,other,True,True
Moreover concerns about the United States could be transmitted via financial market expectations which are currently pricing in a perfect disinflation process with a soft landing for the economy a fall in inflation lower interest rates etc.,True,machine,True,True
The disinflation process in the United States has slowed considerably inflation is slightly below 3.5 and core inflation is just under 4.,True,machine,True,True
19 March 2024 Looking at recent inflation developments we can see a very clear disinflationary process.,True,other,True,True
This is reflected in both headline and core inflation readings.,True,other,True,True
And this is a risk especially for services inflation because services are labour intensive and shielded from foreign competition.,True,warfare,True,True
In that sense services inflation is stickier.,True,other,True,True
We project that inflation in 12 to 18 months from now will be hovering around our 2 target but we dont see a risk of it falling below that.,True,orientation,True,True
We need to see a steady continuous convergence of inflation towards 2.,True,orientation,True,True
Several factors influence exchange rate developments including differences in terms of economic performance the evolution of inflation and the decisions taken by monetary authorities.,True,plant,True,True
7 February 2024 It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action.,True,orientation,True,True
Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down.,True,orientation,True,True
And importantly look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades.,True,other,True,True
It's true of course that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supplyside shocks.,True,orientation,True,True
This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation.,True,orientation,True,True
Initially we had the quick wins of disinflation which is the reversal of the supplyside shocks.,True,sports,True,True
We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6 in October 2022 to 2.9 only a year later.,True,orientation,True,True
Since then inflation has remained broadly stable.,True,orientation,True,True
We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile.,True,orientation,True,True
We see sticky services inflation.,True,other,True,True
It means we must be patient and cautious because we know also from historical experience that inflation can flare up again.,True,fire,True,True
I'm not saying that a flareup in inflation is going to happen.,True,fire,True,True
This will probably increase inflationary pressures as I've explained in several speeches.,True,other,True,True
But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a lowgrowth lowinflation environment.,True,orientation,True,True
However it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation.,True,animal,True,True
We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is.,True,orientation,True,True
What I showed in thatspeechis that there is no simple onetoone relationship between money growth and inflation.,True,other,True,False
But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment.,True,orientation,True,True
We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II and inflation came back.,True,orientation,True,True
One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth.,True,other,True,True
As discussed before the ECBs asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment.,True,other,True,True
We had experienced too low inflation over many years.,True,orientation,True,True
Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound.,True,orientation,True,True
Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation.,True,other,True,True
ECB research shows that as a consequence the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8 point higher.,False,,False,False
And as weve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week were determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2 and were making good progress.,True,orientation,True,True
31 January 2024 There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area the first of which is inflation.,False,,False,False
Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates.,True,warfare,True,True
Please dont forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices then people regain their purchasing power.,True,disease,True,True
So by reducing inflation we are also contributing to more growth in the future.,True,other,True,True
Butinflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently.,True,other,True,True
I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.,True,other,True,True
We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2 in the medium term.,True,other,True,True
If inflation is significantly above that there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages for example which in turn pushes inflation higher still.,True,orientation,True,True
But even if you do assume that we were late just look at the outcomes within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10 to less than 3 and no deep recession materialised.,True,orientation,True,True
So far despite the delicate situation we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market.,True,other,True,True
13 January 2024 The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months.,False,,True,False
By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.,True,fire,True,True
The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections Im not seeing some major downside surprise.,False,,False,False
And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome.,True,other,True,True
But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and for the time being wages are still growing well above any kind of longrun equilibrium rate.,True,other,True,True
Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is on its own terms inflationary.,True,other,True,True
But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.,False,,False,False
We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation.,False,,True,False
For the whole euro area if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent.,False,,False,False
So for this year and next year we still expect high levels to compensate for the high inflation especially in 2022.,False,,True,False
The inflation situation is very unusual the surge in inflation was very intense.,True,fire,True,True
But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year.,True,other,True,True
We had very atypical factors driving inflation as historically monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy.,True,fire,True,True
The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russias aggression in Ukraine.,False,,False,False
But its very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock.,True,other,True,True
There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded.,True,disease,True,True
If people expect inflation to remain at a high level then firms would try to set high prices and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages.,True,other,True,True
You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded.,True,disease,True,True
So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates.,True,other,True,True
But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated.,True,warfare,True,True
The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly before the problem is really conquered then we get another inflation wave and then another wave of interest rate hikes.,True,warfare,True,True
So its important for us to take our time and make sure theres enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target.,True,other,True,True
But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect which would be unwelcome in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments.,True,other,True,True
It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rateshttpswww.ecb.europa.eupubpdfscpopsecb.op279016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11aAskECB Isabel_Schnabel Before the pandemic research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio.,False,,False,False
