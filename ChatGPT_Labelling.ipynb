    "Definition: Conceptual metaphors refer to linguistic expressions that metaphorically represent abstract concepts in terms of more concrete concepts.\n",

    "Identifying Metaphorical and Non-Metaphorical Usage:\n",
    "To identify whether the use of \"inflation\" is metaphorical or non-metaphorical, consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is another domain being used to describe inflation?: Check if the sentence draws on concepts from a different area of experience to explain or depict inflation.\n",
    "Metaphorical: \"Inflation is eroding our savings.\" (Here, \"eroding\" draws on the domain of natural wear and tear, often associated with physical erosion.)\n",
    "Non-Metaphorical: \"Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index.\" (This is a straightforward, literal description.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the language used more concrete and vivid?: Metaphors often use vivid and concrete imagery to make abstract ideas more relatable.\n",
    "Metaphorical: \"Inflation is a beast that must be tamed.\" (The use of \"beast\" provides a vivid and concrete image.)\n",
    "Non-Metaphorical: \"Inflation affects the purchasing power of money.\" (This is a direct explanation without vivid imagery.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the purpose to simplify and relate?: Metaphors are often used to simplify complex ideas and relate them to common experiences.\n",
    "Metaphorical: \"The economy is overheating due to inflation.\" (This uses the concept of overheating, which is a familiar experience, to explain economic stress.)\n",
    "Non-Metaphorical: \"High inflation rates can lead to increased interest rates.\" (This is a factual statement explaining a cause-and-effect relationship.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Instructions:\n",
    "- If one sentence contains multiple metaphors, return the sentence multiple times with each metaphor labeled separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Input:\n",
    "[\"China worries that such rapid growth could ignite inflation, and the countrys banking industry has been trying since last year to bring the rate down to 7 percent a year.\",\n",
    "\"But the evidence from that earlier period is tainted by the fact that inflation was roaring at the time creating bracket creep, over-taxation of illusory capital gains and paper profits, and rising interest rates.\"]\n",

not covered by the above categories]\\n\\nDefinition: Conceptual metaphors refer to linguistic expressions that metaphorically represent abstract concepts in terms of more concrete concepts.\\n\\nIdentifying Metaphorical and Non-Metaphorical Usage:\\nTo identify whether the use of \"inflation\" is metaphorical or non-metaphorical, consider the following questions:\\n\\nIs another domain being used to describe inflation?: Check if the sentence draws on concepts from a different area of experience to explain or depict inflation.\\nMetaphorical: \"Inflation is eroding our savings.\" (Here, \"eroding\" draws on the domain of natural wear and tear, often associated with physical erosion.)\\nNon-Metaphorical: \"Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index.\" (This is a straightforward, literal description.)\\n\\nIs the language used more concrete and vivid?: Metaphors often use vivid and concrete imagery to make abstract ideas more relatable.\\nMetaphorical: \"Inflation is a beast that must be tamed.\" (The use of \"beast\" provides a vivid and concrete image.)\\nNon-Metaphorical: \"Inflation affects the purchasing power of money.\" (This is a direct explanation without vivid imagery.)\\n\\nIs the purpose to simplify and relate?: Metaphors are often used to simplify complex ideas and relate them to common experiences.\\nMetaphorical: \"The economy is overheating due to inflation.\" (This uses the concept of overheating, which is a familiar experience, to explain economic stress.)\\nNon-Metaphorical: \"High inflation rates can lead to increased interest rates.\" (This is a factual statement explaining a cause-and-effect relationship.)\\n\\nAdditional Instructions:\\n- If one sentence contains multiple metaphors, return the sentence multiple times with each metaphor labeled separately.\\n\\nExample Input:\\n[\"China worries that such rapid growth could ignite inflation, and the countrys banking industry has been trying since last year to bring the rate down to 7 percent a year.\",\\n\"But the evidence from that earlier period is tainted by the fact that inflation was roaring at the time creating bracket creep, over-taxation of illusory capital gains and paper profits, and rising interest rates.\"]\\n\\nExample Output:\\nSentence: \"China worries that such rapid growth could ignite inflation, and the countrys banking industry has been trying since last year to bring the rate down to 7 percent a year.\" Category: Fire, \\nSentence: \"But the evidence from that earlier period is tainted by the fact that inflation

are much less evident in services.\\', \\'The global question is why inflation in the goods category is so much weaker while firms in the goods sector are facing more labour cost pressure.\\', \\'But in the end inflation is a monetary phenomenon.\\', \\'But if a central bank is doing its job it is probably not a useful approach to say that these factors permanently affect the inflation rate.\\', \\'I think that ultimately has mixed effects on the inflation dynamics.\\', \"But I wouldn\\'t classify it all as working in one direction in terms of inflationary pressure.\", \\'So it is changing the structure in some categories but we do not think that it is something that is so fundamental that the monetary drivers of inflation are somehow disconnected.\\', \\'But I am not so sure you can say that the overall inflation rate in the economy is permanently affected.\\', \\'We know countries where the monetary forces are a lot looser and there is no problem with inflation getting high.\\', \\'When you are in this kind of low zone where the advanced economies and many emerging markets are where inflation is super low and interest rates and our policy instruments are already quite extended then a negative shock to inflation is going to be more visible because we cannot instantly correct it.\\', \\'The policy space is such that it takes time to restore inflation back to target when you have a low inflation and a low interest rate world with relatively small temporary shocks to inflation which are more visible and more persistent.\\', \\'First of all low inflation means a small shock compared to the overall inflation rate looks bigger and second our ability to quickly eliminate those shocks is less.\\', \\'Since 2014 the mantra of the ECB has been patience that we are intent on getting inflation back to target.\\', \\'In those countries with stronger economies you might expect to see inflation stronger and the labour market tighter.\\', \\'This is why in the end we do look at the aggregate because the economics of appreciation and depreciation are that if you live in a country which persistently has inflation above the euro area aggregate all else equal it basically means a loss of competitiveness.\\', \\'Equally a country where inflation is below the average over time would gain competitiveness and will climb.\\', \\'Those differentials play a very important role but it is not fundamentally an inflation issue it is a relative price level issue.\\', \\'If you go back long enough there are definitely periods of time when price level inflation was very low but by and large in many of those cases that was a period when you had the gold standard or Bretton Woods and so on.\\', \\'Equally under the gold standard the responsibility for inflation at national level was quite different.\\', \\'At that level we understand that you can have periods of very low interest rates and very low inflation rates.\\', \\'But in terms of the history of modern central banking there isnt such a clear parallel because you had the inflationary pressures in the 1970s and the 1980s and then the disinflation and then the convergence to around 2 in the late 1990s early 2000s.\\', \\'What is different is that getting inflation back to target from below is something where the playbook is quite different to getting inflation back to target from above.\\', \\'The motivation was to rule out deflation.\\', \\'There were signs of inflation dynamics approaching zero or even going negative.\\', \\'Phase 1 of the ECBs pivot was to address that to restore enough inflationary pressures that we would be back into sustainably positive inflation territory.\\', \\'Then phase 2 which has been a number of years now not being satisfied with eliminating deflation risk

persistent wage inflation now.\\', \\'Already we see it in services inflation we think we will have it in goods inflation as well.\\', \\'That is a scenario by which inflation will climb over time.\\', \\'The contest is between that and the fact we also know inflation is very persistent.\\', \\'So if you are in a situation where firms and workers have spent several years in a world where inflation has been around 1 then that kind of model influences their expectation of what is going to happen next year and the year after and the year after that.\\', \\'In other words if inflation is low and there is a belief that it will remain low then the incentives to raise prices come down.\\', \\'The ask when inflation is unexpectedly low is less than when inflation is high.\\', \\'Theres definitely a kind of selfreinforcing nature of inflation.\\', \\'Thats true at high inflation its true at low inflation.\\', \\'It is likely that inflation is going to move up slowly and that has been our forecast.\\', \\'The central bank has to be sufficiently proactive in policymaking that people understand that inflation is going to rise over time.\\', \\'If you are indifferent if you ignore the

1.8 at the end of 2018 to 1.5 by September 2019.\\', \\'When I talk about the inflation projection it is basically aggregating everything in our macro models.\\', \\'But we also know especially in the world of very low inflation those factors are not directly controlled by the central bank.\\', \\'In the end I share the view of many that the most important influence on expectations is actual inflation.\\', \\'Unless we get actual inflation up we can talk as much as we like and communicate as much as we like but in the absence of evidence that inflation is moving up then many people will ignore the central banks communication.\\', \\'If you knew for sure inflation was going to be 1.0 forever 1.5 forever 2.0 forever then I would agree with you it doesnt really matter.\\', \\'The policy space when inflation is 2 means if theres a negative shock we basically have 200 basis points of cutting before getting to zero compared to 100 basis points if the inflation rate were 1.\\', \\'There is a universal consensus that you really dont want to get into a situation where a negative shock can drive you into deflation.\\', \\'Our ability to use the traditional policy tool which is a positive policy rate is bigger if the inflation rate is 2 than if the inflation rate is 1 or zero.\\', \\'Even before you get to housing there are huge differences in the inflation rates facing individuals.\\', \\'Depending where you are in terms of your point in life young versus old depending on whether youre in a country where youre renting versus where you are owneroccupied depending whether you are in a country where house prices are falling like in Italy versus where house prices are going up like in northern Europe theres going to be a lot of variation in individual inflation rates.\\', \\'For example at one of our recent meetings I was looking at what the inflation rate would look like if we included a measure of owneroccupied housing in the index.\\', \\'The inflation rate would be a little bit higher now.\\', \\'Housing is quite cyclical so in a downturn the inflation rate would fall more quickly because if you have a negative shock if you look at the proxy measures that are being generated they do fall more quickly in a recession.\\', \\'This goes back to the issue of inflation expectations.\\', \\'If you do not provide stimulus that gets inflation back towards the target if inflation remains low for a longer and longer period of time and then if you have a negative shock you run the risk of being in a situation where essentially you hit the limits of monetary policy.\\', \\'Swedens inflation rate is closer to target than the ECBs inflation rate is.\\', \\'It is a lot easier to make that decision when inflation is closer to 2 percent as in Sweden than when it is still too far away as it is here.\\', \\'Broadly speaking if we were to have the same fiscal policy as the United States then yes inflation would be a lot higher.\\', \\'The fact that we have this global low inflation environment also means if there is a turn there could be a global turn in a synchronised way.\\', \\'I think there are downside risks and while I would not like to call the forces that raise inflation upside risks because they may be bad news for the global economy like deglobalisation.\\', \\'But there could be forces that are inflationary that could

high but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation which is a welcome development.', 'Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash the detailed inflation data dont come out until the middle of the month.', 'But what is really important some of the conjectures about the summer whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries services inflation remains significant but the fact that there was some easing I think helps to limit that narrative.', 'But what I would say is that after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year we will be keeping an eye on this situation.', 'Essentially what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023 with further progress in 2024 and in 2025.', 'And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic where its a multiyear process so 10 per cent inflation doesnt collapse to 2 per cent very quickly but the direction of a significant drop this year Its already halved from 10 to 5 with further progress expected this year.', 'That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors.', 'That inflation again does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent.', 'What is a timely manner Its sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is timelimited its temporary and therefore you should not change your longerterm behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high.', 'We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode.', 'Its not going to disappear overnight but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation weve seen into a longerterm projection.', 'I think the history of price controls is that ultimately its not going to be the best way to fight inflation.', 'They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies for example in the 1970s that essentially once they are lifted a lot of the suppressed pricing reemerges.', 'I think theres a distinct debate and let me emphasise that its distinct which has played out in countries like France for example which is that it is not price controls but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase.', 'In turn if you limit the intensity of inflation then you may weaken secondround effects.', 'But if it was just firms arbitrarily

this and let me come back to the basic pattern here inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and as we talked about earlier on we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it.', 'Number one the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse.', 'If you have a high inflation rate even if you expect it to ease over time and a very low interest rate that creates a lot of proinflationary incentives.', 'So to avoid proinflationary behaviour its important that interest rates go up enough.', 'We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been I think several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low because that dynamic would have taken over.', 'One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low when inflation is going to be high on a multiyear basis could have led to this kind of procyclicality which would make life even worse.', 'Then the question is how do you make sure that process is contained Because we know that if inflation gets embedded it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time this famous phrase of titfortat inflation.', 'This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means as I said earlier that firms know they have to limit their price increases and workers can be confident that because inflation is contained their loss of living standards is not so much at risk.', 'If you fed a model with a larger more persistent energy shock it would produce more inflation.', 'Theyre well able to design a nonlinear model theyre well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their onceayear revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently of what happens similarly if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock and therefore for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits they need much bigger wage increases than normal.', 'In the end those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation but nowhere near the scale weve had.', 'And I would say that over this year the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation but its going to be a multiyear process.', 'Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought.', 'Essentially this damage to supply has to be proinflationary.', 'So the net impact on inflation and therefore the role of monetary policy is maybe relatively contained.', 'If you look at for example the IMFs World Economic Outlook from last October essentially that was one of the big messages the inflation effect is there its not zero but basically it is relatively limited.', 'But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list.', 'As I mentioned to you I dont think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero but because it operates both on demand and supply its relatively contained.', 'Then if I turn to right now let me emphasise we have a cyclical inflation problem not a longterm inflation problem.', 'Because if we did not do that then people I think would build their expectations that inflation would basically become deanchored and then those tenyear rates would go up.', 'What I would say however is that were midway through this inflation adjustment.', 'What I outlined here earlier on is this vision this narrative is a multiyear perspective but inflation will come

in relation to underlying inflation and the third is an assessment on how powerfully and how quickly monetary tightening is working.', 'On underlying inflation we also need to look at actual outcomes because forecasting techniques are limited which is even more true now given the volatility and the shocks weve seen.', 'So were all signed up to the criterion that sufficient progress in underlying inflation is important.', 'Typically step one in assessing inflation is to take out energy and food because these are usually more volatile.', 'The higher headline inflation is the more pressure there will be on the cost of living on wage inflation and other elements which go into core inflation since underlying inflation is heavily influenced by headline inflation.', 'Food inflation is very significant.', 'As for core inflation its difficult to overstate the importance of recognising that the drivers of goods inflation and services inflation are quite different.', 'Looking at core inflation as an aggregate is not super helpful and I think we need to look at the dynamics of goods inflation and services inflation in a more granular way.', 'For energy food and goods theres a lot of forwardlooking indicators saying that inflation pressures in all of those categories should come down quite a bit.', 'The fact that these are turning around including through the easing of bottlenecks and global factors suggest that there will be significant reductions in inflation rates for energy food and goods.', 'There are two big questions about services inflation.', 'One is the interconnection with wage inflation because a lot of service sectors are quite labourintensive.', 'So the supplyside component of services inflation should ease.', 'And goods inflation in the United States is off quite a bit.', 'There is also room for core inflation to fall if unit profits normalise in those sectors.', 'Theres a lot of forwardlooking indicators which suggest that inflation is going to fall.', 'Is it the case that these extraordinary unit profits have room to narrow because of an extra year of adjustment to the reopening the dampening of demand and the scale of momentum in wage inflation Interest rates are most effective when they are set in a durable fashion.', 'Lets say inflation starts to fall in line with the forecast.', 'If we settle into our durable plateau of interest rates it will not be the case that in the first month of a significant fall in core inflation we would need to immediately start revising our plan.', 'We should have a strong focus on underlying inflation dynamics which is not the same concept as core inflation.', 'We should also recognise that underlying and headline inflation are not independent.', 'If there is a big decline in headline inflation that will reduce pressures for wage increases because the number one theme in wage bargaining right now is compensating workers for the high inflation that has already happened.', 'If headline inflation is coming down that improvement or less bad news about the cost of living will lower pressure for high wage increases going into 2024.', 'This is fundamental and I dont think theres a contest between underlying inflation and headline inflation.', 'If it is deemed that the inflation forecast hasnt improved enough or were not seeing sufficient progress in underlying inflation or we think the monetary transmission mechanism is working too slowly then you can say with a set of conditional statements that a higher rate will be desirable.', 'The overall philosophy is that we will bring rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive which depends on where the inflation forecast is where we are with underlying inflation and where we are with the monetary transmission mechanism.', 'There is a universal conviction that when inflation is stabilised at 2 we are not going back to the prepandemic scenario of super low level of interest rates and quantitative easing.', 'But I absolutely sign up to the monetary policy philosophy that wherever we get to we should be slow to come down until we have very strong evidence not just in the forecast but also in our ongoing assessment of underlying inflation that we are returning inflation to target.', 'The fact that in 20082012 Europe had a lot of financial distress which was definitely disinflationary doesnt mean we think that is how monetary policy should work.', 'This is where the progress in underlying inflation is going to matter in addition to the forecast.', 'One the most important one is what is the risk to our inflation target of 2 I think the risk remains skewed to the upside.', 'We look at scenarios such as whether inflation expectations get deanchored or a wageprice spiral gets embedded.', 'You can definitely come up with plausible scenarios for inflation that doesnt come back to 2 quickly enough.', 'The scenarios where inflation falls below 2 you can put some weight on them.', 'But thats fixable in the sense that if the inflation dynamic weakens more quickly then we can adjust.', 'But in the upside scenario where inflation doesnt come back quickly enough then the longer it remains high the more it becomes normalised and then we have a significant problem.']\\n\\nReturn the metaphors in the format:\\nSentence: [Sentence text] Category:
