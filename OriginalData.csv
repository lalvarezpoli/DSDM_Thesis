2024-02-07,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 2 February 2024","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 2 February 2024 7 February 2024  Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.   "
2024-02-03,Frank Elderson,Interview with De Volkskrant,"Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Jonathan Witteman on 29 January 2024","  INTERVIEW  Interview with De Volkskrant   Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Jonathan Witteman on 29 January 2024 3 February 2024  In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.

2024-01-31,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Die Zeit,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Kolja Rudzio","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Die Zeit   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Kolja Rudzio 31 January 2024  Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!    "

In his last ever campaign appearances, he supported pro-European parliamentary candidates in Alsace and Lorraine. Born during the war, raised in the French occupation zone, elected in the border region of southern Baden, friendship with France was close to his heart throughout his life – as the foundation for a strong Europe.  As a minister, Wolfgang Schäuble worked in close contact with his French counterparts. He was the first German finance minister to participate in a meeting of the French cabinet at the Élysée Palace. He formulated the aspiration to always take French and European interests into account: “If a solution is good for Europe, then it is good for Germany. And if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany”. German unity and European integration, open borders and joint security, a strong euro as a guarantee of stability – these fundamental convictions shaped his actions.  As President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, together with the then President of the French National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, spearheaded the establishment of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on 25 March 2019 in Paris; this joint chamber, comprising 50 German and 50 French members of parliament, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both Presidents had previously signed the Franco-German Parliamentary Accord, which – some 56 years after the Élysée Treaty – adds a parliamentary dimension to the Franco-German friendship as an intergovernmental agreement, thus raising it to a completely new level. None of this would have been possible without Wolfgang Schäuble’s impassioned efforts alongside his colleague in Paris.  Even in his last interview – published on 24 December 2023, just two days before he passed away – Wolfgang Schäuble called for reviving the Weimar Triangle as a “German-Polish-French engine for Europe” and strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities: “Let’s follow this European path. Only by working together can Europe play an economic, military and environmental role in the world.“  That is his legacy. And that is why the state memorial ceremony in his honour is quite rightly taking place on 22 January, “Franco-German Day” – exactly 61 years after the signing of the Élysée Treaty and six years to the day since Wolfgang Schäuble became the first President of the Bundestag to address the French National Assembly on 22 January 2018. In that speech he described the Franco-German friendship as ""a gift from history"", but one owed to the vision of courageous people who, after the world wars and the crimes committed by Germany, showed the way to reconciliation. Wolfgang Schäuble said: “What has been achieved inspires us to move forward” and added “Let us use the freedom we enjoy today. Let us live up to our responsibilities as courageously as the original signatories. Together! ”  Wolfgang Schäuble more than lived up to these responsibilities, and did so honestly and tirelessly. Yet the state memorial ceremony in the German Bundestag with Emmanuel Macron is more than just a tribute to great merit. It is a mission and an appeal. It is a mission entrusted to us, as leaders in politics and society, to bring the European vision to life in a spirit of close partnership. And it is an appeal to young people to keep enthusiastically pursuing the idea of Europe. Peace, freedom and friendship cannot be taken for granted, we have to work for them again and again. As for European integration, it is far from complete and must continue to be shaped, with determination – and by those who are truly European at heart, as was Wolfgang Schäuble.  We will honour Wolfgang Schäuble's memory with immense gratitude for his life's work. We pay tribute to a great German, a great friend of France and a great European. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Wolfgang Schäuble.   "
2024-01-13,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Corriere della Sera,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini 13 January 2024    The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?  The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.  Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.  The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.   What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?  The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.  Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.   Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?  Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.   The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?  I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.  It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.  Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?  For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.  Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?  The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.   Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?  For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.  Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?   We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.   There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?  Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.  Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?  That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.  EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?   A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.  Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?  We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.  Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?  It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.   "
2024-01-10,Isabel Schnabel,Q&A on X,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 10 January 2024","  INTERVIEW  Q&A on X   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 10 January 2024 10 January 2024 Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% inflation is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: ""central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s"". Yet, we have seen how inflation has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the ""normal mechanism"" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of ""austrian"" or ""hard-money"" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As inflation falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about inflation reacceleration or does the link between Growth/Inflation (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Inflation has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on inflation in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee inflation reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to inflation as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling inflation raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying inflation are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that inflation is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and inflation. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly disinflationary before the pandemic and inflationary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of inflationary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our inflation target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average inflation after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act inflation after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average inflation?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, inflation will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term inflation and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or inflation.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and inflation is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core inflation above 2% for the entire year. At which level inflation would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that inflation sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the disinflationary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate inflation BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see inflation returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect inflation to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Does the ECB take into account the asymmetries that are produced from its policies due to the fact that the EZ is not a proper monetary union? Do you think it should/shouldn't? Thank you   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further steps in European integration would clearly benefit our single monetary policy. Therefore we need to make further progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union. #AskECB    @ecb   Why would any Country give up their sovereign currency knowing that money can be printed instead of borrowed ?

2024-01-03,Christine Lagarde,Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit,"Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB ","  INTERVIEW  Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit   Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB  3 January 2024 When I think of Wolfgang Schäuble, the first image I see is him sitting across from me at the table of the French cabinet in the Élysée Palace, the first German finance minister to participate in such a meeting. I see him sitting at the negotiating table in Brussels, at one of our many meetings that ran long into the night. I hear the straight talker who never shied away from difficult decisions. I remember the dedicated public servant, a master of diplomacy with the intellectual ability to understand opposing viewpoints. I see a natural statesman with the courage to stand by his convictions as well as the pragmatism to recognise the world as it is. And I see a man of loyalty and kindness.  The recent passing of my dear friend and colleague saddens me deeply, and my heart goes out to his family. Yet I take comfort in remembering his remarkable achievements for Europe. I recall his own words in this regard because they capture his clear commitment to both Germany and Europe: “If a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.” Few have done as much for Germany and Europe over such a long period as Wolfgang, with his more than half a century of public service. As minister of the interior, he was at the heart of Germany’s reunification process. It was a moment of profound change for the country and for all Europeans, and one that had to be handled with great care in view of the sensitivities of neighbouring countries to German history. Wolfgang understood that one of the best ways for Germany to demonstrate its responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours. That was no small matter in a nation so proud of the Deutsche Mark. But he knew that a single currency would bind Europe together and protect the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations, and that this was in Germany’s and in Europe’s best interests. When Europe’s sovereign debt crisis came, Wolfgang was a calming influence, reminding us that the euro is much more than just a currency. His defence of Europe was unwavering and absolute. Nevertheless, he was always self-reflective, and later asked himself how things could have been done differently, potentially causing less suffering. Wolfgang’s intellectual rigour stemmed from his ability to combine the subtlety of a diplomat with the attention to detail of a lawyer. It was a quality that put him at the forefront of discussions in the 1990s on how to build a more deeply integrated European framework.  His statesmanship would have been welcome in today’s challenging environment of extreme views. His success did not come through a forceful personality, but from understanding how to find common ground with others. This approach has served Germany and Europe well. In my experience, Wolfgang’s philosophy was consistent: stay true to yourself and to your democratic institutions. Now is a timely moment to remember that as we remember him. I will miss my dear friend, and the birthday flowers he sent me over many years!   "
2023-12-22,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Meike Schreiber und Markus Zydra on 18 December 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Meike Schreiber und Markus Zydra on 18 December 2023 22 December 2023    Inflation has recently fallen to 2.4%, more rapidly than expected. Are you satisfied?    We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2%. We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term, as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire, such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services. We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2% by 2025.  So, we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.   But you do want to go the last mile?  We must go the last mile: we have an inflation target of 2%.   Would 2.1% not be enough?  We want to return to 2% on a sustainable basis.   There is war in Ukraine and Gaza. How much do global crises influence the central bank’s work?   Geopolitical shocks lead to uncertainty and thereby affect economic decisions. At the same time, they can also push up energy prices and hit world trade by disrupting supply chains – which we see happening in the Red Sea right now. Geopolitics can also influence the green transition, if the supply of commodities, such as those required for producing solar cells or batteries, is restricted for political ends. All of this affects our core business: the fight against inflation.   Your policy rate decisions are data-dependent, as you always emphasise. How useful are historical data to you when, as at present, the global situation is constantly changing fundamentally?  Historical data are valuable as one can derive patterns from them. But the world can change very quickly. We then need to adjust our analyses, without discarding historical knowledge. The macroeconomic environment has indeed changed radically over the past few years. We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then – owing to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine – quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation. Looking at the period of low interest rates would hardly help. But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.   Inflation was very low in the past decades. Was that mainly because of the central banks’ sound monetary policy? Or was it partly luck, thanks to globalisation for example?   It was both. After the great inflation of the 1970s, monetary policy changed fundamentally. Central banks have become more independent and have a clearer mandate: price stability. This has increased the credibility of monetary policy. But there have also been macroeconomic trends, particularly globalisation and China’s entry into the world market, which played an important role and brought down inflation.  Has the fight for stable prices got tougher?   Since 2020 there have been several severe external shocks. That makes monetary policy more challenging.   Will inflation be higher in future than it was before?   Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2%. At the same time, we may be confronted with more supply-side shocks. And these could turn out to be inflationary, even though that is hard to predict. Climate change, for example, drives prices, we see that already. Extreme weather can push up food prices, low water levels in the Panama Canal increase transportation costs, and carbon taxes raise the price of fossil fuels. A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well. But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence, which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.   When you joined the Executive Board in 2020 you wanted to smooth the fractious relationship between Germans and the ECB. Did you manage to do so?   The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB. It has enabled us to strengthen the ECB’s credibility.   But the ECB was too slow in combating inflation. Many people haven’t forgotten that.     We acted relatively late, but all the more decisively. We sharply increased interest rates within a short time, and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation. Inflation was initially caused by rising energy prices and disrupted supply chains owing to the pandemic and the war. These constrained aggregate supply, while demand remained robust. Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations. We succeeded in doing that. It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2%.   Inflation has fallen, but the higher prices continue to put pressure on people.  The prices are clearly higher than before the pandemic, and monetary policy cannot roll back that increase. And people would not be better off if we plunged the economy into years of deep recession just to bring the prices back to their old levels.  Would you manage, though?  With massive consequences, but this is not the task of monetary policy. An energy price shock makes an economy that is reliant on energy imports poorer overall. Somebody has to bear those losses.  When you have achieved your 2% inflation target, is there a risk of forgetting that the high level of prices is as good as entrenched now?  We target inflation, not the price level. Also in the past, it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.  The quick and sharp interest rate hikes have led to banks suddenly making record profits. Is this fair?  Our decisions are guided by our price stability mandate. But they have side effects, including their impact on bank profits. Banks have lent money at higher rates, but they have not passed the higher interest rates on to their depositors immediately or in full. But we expect banks’ profits to be under more pressure in the future because banks will face higher funding costs and rising credit default risks, while lending is weakening. Banks would therefore be well-advised to use these short-term profits to build up a buffer against future losses.  But banks tend not to do that, opting to pay out dividends instead. Erring on the side of caution would certainly not hurt the banks.  The high profits are also boosted by the 4% deposit facility rate which banks receive on their excess reserves. The ECB could shrink these deposits by raising the minimum reserve requirement. Why has it not done so?  In July we decided to no longer remunerate the minimum reserves while keeping the minimum reserve requirement at 1% of the minimum reserve base, which consists mainly of customer deposits. The minimum reserve requirement is not an effective way of compensating the remuneration of excess liquidity. Large banks have the highest excess liquidity, smaller banks have less. At the same time, the smaller banks are mostly funded by deposits. This is why they would be disproportionally affected by higher minimum reserve requirements.  By the same token, large banks are subsidised with the deposit rate, because many smaller lenders only have low excess amounts that are remunerated.  Banks are not subsidised. But the effects of our measures do vary. For example, during the pandemic the ECB granted longer-term loans that have strongly benefited smaller banks. At the same time, until recently banks were charged a negative interest for their excess liquidity, and that affected large banks more. There are no banks that are systematically at an advantage or a disadvantage. All banks are important for the transmission of monetary policy.  The ECB could sell all the sovereign bonds – that would solve the excess reserve problem. The ECB’s balance sheet has already shrunk significantly. This will continue in the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity. But the primary monetary policy instrument is ECB policy rates. The reduction of our balance sheet is happening gradually in the background, also to avoid market turbulence. While we are not expecting any, we are not taking any risks.  The ECB is making losses now because it has to pay high interest to banks while holding low-yielding bonds. A central bank that is making losses doesn’t look too good.  Our bond purchases were always guided by monetary policy considerations. Take the pandemic emergency purchase programme. This measure probably averted a serious financial crisis that would have wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s lives. The ECB’s losses cannot be viewed out of context.  But they do damage your reputation.  We always assess whether our measures are proportionate, and losses can damage the central bank’s credibility and independence. In the future, this might lead to a certain reassessment of bond purchases.  How do you assess the ECB’s bond purchases?  Bond purchases can be employed for achieving two distinct goals: price stability on the one hand, and market stabilisation on the other. They were very successful in stabilising the financial markets. But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation. At the time, one problem was the very restrictive fiscal policy. Governments failed to make use of the low interest rate period to invest, and this made life difficult for monetary policy.  The lesson here is that fiscal and monetary policy need to pull together.  When you joined the ECB in 2020, inflation was low, the key interest rate below zero and central banks were making profits. This has all changed. How has it affected you?  I have learnt that the world can change much more quickly than you think. The central bank needs to react swiftly in such situations, and this is a challenge. But I think that we have done pretty well in the past four years.   "
2023-12-21,Luis de Guindos,Interview with 20 Minutos,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Emilio Ordiz and Jorge Millán","  INTERVIEW  Interview with 20 Minutos   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Emilio Ordiz and Jorge Millán 21 December 2023  Wage cost data in Spain point to an increase of 4.7%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that domestic inflation is resisting and is largely predicated by wages. Do you think wage moderation is required to beat inflation?  A year ago inflation was above 10% and now it is below 3%. Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable, i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation, basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade, and because monetary policy is taking effect. However, average wage growth in the euro area is over 5%, whereas productivity is barely improving. This means that unit labour costs are rising, which adds to inflationary pressures. In 2022 profit margins increased considerably, but this year the increase has been more moderate. This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs, which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.   What will the ECB do in this situation?  We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins, as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2% target. We are keeping a very close eye on this.  The EU is emerging from this crisis better than it did in 2008. What do you think has changed?  We have the experience of what happened in 2008 and the two crises are completely different. The 2008 crisis broke out on the back of extremely high private sector debt levels, which had a significant impact on the banking sector. The response was also very different. For the crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic, there have been no limits to fiscal policy, and this has been accompanied by monetary policy that has also been very expansive. In addition to this, the European Union came up with an action plan for all countries throughout the bloc, providing them with funding through the Next Generation EU programme.  However, the situation has now changed. Almost all income indicators have returned to their pre-pandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation. To this end, the ECB takes action through its monetary policy but we also need to see fiscal policy return to normal.   With euro area inflation at 2.4% in November and euro area GDP stagnating for the past twelve months, how do you explain to people why interest rates are being kept so high?   Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do, which is bring inflation down. Monetary policy operates by tightening financing conditions: higher interest rates affect levels of economic activity. And when economic activity is dampened, inflation slows. Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2%, monetary policy might then start to ease. But it’s still too early for that to happen.   When can we expect to see the first interest rate cuts?   If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time, current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2%. We are data dependent. The data have been favourable but still not enough for us to change our monetary policy. It’s therefore too early to talk about a cut in interest rates.  What do you think about opinions from certain quarters that the ECB is sort of following in the slipstream of the US Federal Reserve?  The US economy’s fundamentals and cycles differ from Europe’s. US fiscal policy has been much more expansive, growth is higher and the rate of unemployment, below 4%, is even lower than in the euro area. With an unemployment rate of 6.5%, our labour market is in good shape, but on the whole the economies are in different situations. As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, what the Federal Reserve does is relevant, but it does not determine the ECB’s monetary decisions.  Do you think that now is the time for completing banking union? This debate always seems to be ongoing but never seems to reach a conclusion.  Completing the banking union is essential if we want full economic and monetary union in Europe. There is one pillar missing: a European deposit insurance scheme. European elections will be held in June 2024, offering another opportunity for this. Completing banking union should be on the future European Commission’s agenda, as should making progress on a fiscal union through the introduction of a common fiscal stabilisation function.  Do you think there is the risk of a recession if, for example, the war in Ukraine drags on?   The ECB does not expect a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But beyond whether or not a recession will occur, the main issue is that Europe’s economy has a structural growth problem. Both our projections and those of the European Commission see very moderate growth of around 1% up until 2026. These potential growth levels are low because productivity is barely improving. Europe needs to import more energy than other global economies. As a result, the energy crisis further exacerbates its competitiveness issues. Structural reforms are therefore necessary. The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, but to achieve growth, other factors must be brought into play.  What would these reforms have to be?  One would be completing banking union, as I mentioned. Clear progress also needs to be made towards the capital markets union, and also in the single market of the European Union. Not much is said about the latter, but we are in a situation where there are hardly any limits on state aid, which creates imbalances between countries, depending on their fiscal position. The focus basically needs to be on Europe's low growth potential, how to increase productivity and the reforms needed to boost growth in the medium term.  Do you think it would be feasible to standardise the formula for the European Union’s Next Generation funds?  The Next Generation funds were a response to the pandemic and had two very positive aspects: the issuance of joint debt and the fact that part of the aid consisted of grants rather than loans. Beyond the clearly positive effects of the programme, it ultimately highlights that we need to complete our economic and monetary union. And to do so it is vital to have a permanent centralised fiscal policy instrument, and to implement structural reforms.  Staying with the European Union, there was an agreement on fiscal rules yesterday. How does the ECB see it?   Markets are calm and interest rates on sovereign debt have even fallen. But this can change relatively quickly in the context of low growth, tight monetary policy and geopolitical risks. That is why it is very important to have a clear framework of common fiscal rules. We welcome that there's an agreement because that reduces uncertainty in the markets.  And what is the ECB calling for?  Our recommendation is that the framework should be simple, transparent, easy to understand and countercyclical. In other words, it should allow fiscal policy to be expansionary in bad times and contractionary in good times. Fiscal action plans need to ensure a prudent and sustained reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in structural deficits. They should also create fiscal space for public investment in digitalisation, climate change or defence, and should provide incentives for structural reforms.  In the end, would you say that the EU has completely ditched austerity?  Sometimes it is not clear what is meant by “austerity”. Fiscal sustainability is essential, and, at the same time, fiscal rules have to allow for countercyclical action. And to be able to increase the public deficit during an economic downturn, countries need to rebuild their fiscal positions and reduce their public deficit when the going is good. Beyond fiscal policy, one basic difference between the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis was the very different monetary policy response, providing liquidity to banks and launching a pandemic asset purchase programme that has ultimately provided immense support to the European economy.  Do you think southern European countries have learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis?  Banking systems are much healthier than they were in the period from 2008 to 2011. And that is a key change. Moreover, these countries have made efforts to become more competitive and have a balance of payments surplus. For example, Greece and Portugal have made very significant budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in the risk premia and the ratings agencies. Many southern European countries have made considerable efforts to improve the sustainability of their public finances in the medium term. That is why it makes no sense to now try to create some kind of north-south divide between EU countries.   One of the most important projects the ECB is currently working on is a digital euro. How is it going and what are its key components?  At the moment, we all have euro banknotes in our wallets. A digital euro would be exactly the same, just on our mobiles. It would basically be the banknotes we have now, but in digital form and also backed by the central bank. We want it to be an additional, alternative means of payment. It is not meant to replace banknotes but to complement them. There would also be a limit on the amount of digital euro you can hold. In other words, it would be a means of payment but not a means of saving. We want a digital euro to be more comparable to banknotes than current accounts.  Do you share the Government’s optimism about the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy has a healthy banking system, which is completely different to how the situation was in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the economy is competitive, with a surplus in the balance of payments. It is important that both are maintained in the future. The external sector, including international tourism, has helped a lot in restoring income to pre-pandemic levels.   Are there any challenges?  Education still needs some work. This affects medium- and long-term growth because there are mismatches between labour supply and demand. The 12% unemployment rate means there is room for improvement in the labour market. Like some other euro area countries, Spain has a high public debt-to-GDP ratio of 110%. It is therefore important that these countries implement a prudent adjustment programme to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP.  All countries are going to face major challenges: economic slowdown, geopolitical risks, a new framework of fiscal rules or higher interest rates. That is why economic policy must be predictable.  The last two questions have a Spanish context. What do you think about Nadia Calviño’s appointment as the next president of the European Investment Bank?   Naturally, as a Spaniard, I think it is positive that Spaniards hold key positions in the European Union. I wish her and the institution all the very best.   And in the same vein, particularly seeing as you have held the post that Calviño now leaves, who would you like to see occupy the position left vacant by her?  It is not my place to comment on domestic affairs. I am sure whoever is appointed will be competent and I wish them every success.   "
2023-12-05,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2023 5 December 2023  What is your take on the unexpectedly benign November inflation reading? Does the recent string of downside surprises change your view about the inflation trajectory?  “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” I’m sure you know this famous quote that is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly. This was due to the reversal of the previous supply side shocks and was mainly driven by energy and food prices. Base effects played a significant role. The November flash release was a very pleasant surprise. Most importantly, underlying inflation, which has proven more stubborn, is now also falling more quickly than we had expected. This is quite remarkable. All in all, inflation developments have been encouraging. That said, despite these positive developments, I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely. We continue to expect an uptick over the coming months. There’s going to be a reversal of some fiscal measures and of some base effects, and we cannot exclude that there’s going to be a new price spike in energy or food. Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2% target. Our monetary policy is working. The restrictive policy is contributing to dampening growth in aggregate demand. Economic growth has been weak over the past several quarters, and it’s expected to remain weak this quarter before gradually picking up next year. This period of below-potential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2%. So, I believe we are on track, but we need to remain vigilant.  Are we still on the inflation path you outlined in your September projections?  Let’s see what our December staff projections are going to show. But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2% no later than 2025. This is our main objective.  What is your assessment of growth since the September projections?   Some of the hard data we see are not very good. But some of the soft data are giving us hope. The purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) seem to be bottoming out and they’re even showing a small uptick. Of course, this is from very low levels. But it is in line with our projections. Growth is then expected to pick up gradually next year, mainly due to rising real incomes, which should foster confidence and consumption. All this will depend, to a large extent, on the development of the labour market, which has been very resilient. We have seen that firms have held on to their labour force in spite of weakening economic growth. This is only sustainable if they expect growth to pick up. If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market, this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process. But while we do see some softening in the labour market, we do not expect a significant deterioration or a deep and prolonged recession.  Do you see a risk that the rapid drop in credit demand could exacerbate the downturn?  What we’re seeing is that monetary policy transmission is working. There has been a sharp increase in lending rates and a strong slowdown in loan growth. This is exactly what we wanted to see.  Markets are pricing an early spring rate cut but the ECB has guided for steady rates for several quarters. How do you view this discrepancy?  Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year. Central banks are more cautious, and I would argue they have to be more cautious. After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution. If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a sustainable manner. This should happen no later than 2025.  According to our staff projections, the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame. Transmission is working – lending growth is slowing, the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing. We are right on track. But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation. The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum. We now need to see whether this is sustained. We’ve seen very strong wage growth and weak or even falling productivity, leading to a sharp increase in the growth of unit labour costs. This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular, which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained. We’re going to watch upcoming wage agreements very closely. This will certainly also matter for our monetary policy decisions.  If the current level of restriction is sufficient, does that mean you do not see a need for further rate increases?  The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.  What is sufficiently long? Do you also see several quarters of steady rates?  We need to see more data. There’s first likely going to be an uptick in inflation. So, this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now. And most importantly, we need to see what’s going to happen to underlying inflation, to wage growth, to productivity, to unit profits. In order to be confident that we will sustainably return to our target, we need more time.  Am I reading it correctly that you’re not ruling out a rate cut before mid-year then?  We remain data dependent. That’s the main thing. We have to see what’s going to happen. We have been surprised many times in both directions. So, we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months’ time.   What is your view on the timeframe for ending pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments?  As President Lagarde mentioned, the Governing Council is going to discuss reinvestments under the PEPP in the not-too-distant future and I’ll leave it up to you to interpret what that means. It’s clear that discussion is going to come. It’s also clear that at some point we’re going to fully end PEPP reinvestments. The amounts involved are relatively small and markets are expecting this to happen, so I think it’s not such a big deal.  Am I correctly reading the mood that even if reinvestments end, there is no appetite for outright sales of bonds in either the asset purchase programme (APP) or PEPP portfolios?  We have never discussed outright sales.  You gave a speech in March in which you made the case for a demand-driven system for the ECB’s new operational framework. How has you thinking evolved since?  What I said in that speech is that a demand-driven system is well-suited for a heterogeneous currency union that may be prone to fragmentation. Such a system also likely limits the size of the central bank balance sheet. Of course, it can be designed in many different ways. What we are doing in our framework review is trying to find a system that implements our monetary policy effectively and efficiently in a way that minimises the negative side effects. So, the new system has to take into account the specificities of the euro area financial system. It has to be firmly embedded in our legal framework and it should limit our market footprint. But one should be aware that we are starting from a situation of abundant excess liquidity. So whatever framework we choose, money market rates will initially remain close to the floor.  What is the timeline for the balance sheet to shrink to its optimal size?   That depends on various factors that we can’t project perfectly. It also depends on the framework that we will eventually choose. One of the main drivers of the size of the central bank balance sheet is the growth of what we call autonomous factors – banknotes and official sector deposits – and the growth of reserve requirements. These factors already imply that the balance sheet is going to be around three times as large as before the global financial crisis.  In addition, banks could have a higher demand for excess liquidity for regulatory or precautionary reasons. If the outcome of the review was a demand-driven system, the size of the balance sheet would thus also depend on banks’ demand for excess liquidity. This would mean the size would not be determined by us, which is a good thing, because we don’t know precisely what the demand is.  The Federal Reserve has gone with the floor system. Could two of the world’s biggest central banks operate with different frameworks?  I do not see any problem with that. If you look around the world, you see many different frameworks.  The Fed has a supply-driven floor, the Bank of England a demand-driven floor, and Sveriges Riksbank a narrow corridor, while many central banks in emerging markets have a classical corridor. So, there is a wide variety of models out there that are tailor-made for specific financial systems.    Do you see the need for a structural portfolio of bonds and/or longer-term bank loans? What would the size of such a portfolio need to be?    I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of the framework review. There are different ways to provide liquidity to the financial system and all of them are going to be discussed in the review. We are going to weigh up the benefits and costs of each of them, and it could make sense to have a mix of different tools. We need to keep in mind, though, that this only matters far out in the future, because we are starting from a situation where we have a huge monetary policy bond portfolio. The structure of the balance sheet only becomes relevant when it has to grow again. As regards a structural portfolio, I mentioned in my March speech that this could be considered. Also keep in mind that we de facto already have a structural portfolio because some national central banks are holding bonds in their Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) portfolios.  What do you mean by “far out in the future”? Could it be next decade?  That depends on the decisions we are going to take. If we decided on both longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio, we would have to think about a potential split. But this really depends on many factors and I do not want to make any predictions. What is clear is that the balance sheet has to be much larger than it was before the global financial crisis. But, for all the frameworks under consideration, the balance sheet is going to be much smaller than it is now.  Should the ECB introduce new longer-term refinancing operations?  We will discuss the different options available to provide liquidity to the banks, including longer-term operations. But such a facility would have to be different from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) we were offering during the pandemic, in that it would have to be offered at market rates. From the banks’ perspective, longer-term lending operations are attractive because they provide a certain reliability of funding. And they reach all parts of the banking sector directly. That is very different from asset purchases – when you inject liquidity, it typically ends up with the larger banks and in certain financial centres.  Do you see a case for increasing the minimum reserve requirements, as some of your colleagues advocate?  We had a discussion on minimum reserve requirements in July and we discussed both the calibration and the remuneration. We decided to keep the minimum reserve requirements at 1% but to remunerate them at zero, instead of at the deposit facility rate. The reason for this was proportionality. With this change, we can implement our monetary policy stance in the same way and equally effectively while paying lower interest to the banks. That was the justification for reducing the remuneration. The proportionality argument implies that, if we have two options and one of them leads to losses while the other is just as effective in achieving price stability but reduces these losses, then we should choose the option that generates smaller losses. But let me stress that the minimum reserve requirements are not a tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. They also have distributional effects – they have the greatest impact on the banks with the highest deposit base, which tend to be the smaller banks. We are going to discuss the role of minimum reserve requirements in the operational framework review. And until then, we will not take any decisions.  To what extent should profit and loss considerations matter for monetary policy decisions?  Our monetary policy decisions are determined by our mandate. Profit and loss considerations matter only insofar as they affect our credibility and, consequently, our ability to pursue our mandate.  Andrea Enria argued recently that shadow banks need closer scrutiny, and the ECB could theoretically conduct this supervision. If the ECB supervised them, it could also provide them with access to liquidity facilities. Is that needed?  The experience of the pandemic shows that we are able to distribute liquidity across the financial sector without giving non-banks direct access to our balance sheet. At the moment we are not considering opening up our balance sheet to non-banks because there is no clear case for that.   "
2023-11-29,Luis de Guindos,Interview with De Standaard and La Libre Belgique,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Ruben Mooijman and Ariane van Caloen, on 23 November 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with De Standaard and La Libre Belgique   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Ruben Mooijman and Ariane van Caloen, on 23 November 2023 29 November 2023  Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.   What would you say to those who think that banks are making excessive profits?   The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, which has just been published, indeed shows that bank profitability has risen sharply. This improvement can be attributed to the widening of interest rate margins. The return on equity of euro area banks now stands at around 10%, whereas in 2019, barely five years ago, it stood at 4%. So it has clearly improved.  Still, this is something of an illusion − it is after all a short-term improvement. In the long term, we expect profitability to fall again. Why? There are several factors. First, the economy is slowing, which will lead to higher default rates and a decline in asset quality. Second, banks will have to pay more to attract deposits. On term accounts, for example, interest rates have already risen sharply. Likewise, the bonds that banks issue themselves will need to carry a higher return. So overall the cost of bank funding is on the rise. And finally, an often-overlooked factor is that demand for credit is falling. Putting all that together, you can see that high bank profitability is not sustainable. In fact, the financial markets are already convinced of this, as bank share valuations are in no way reflecting expectations of high profits.  Are the banks sufficiently covered for interest rate risks. If not, could the regulator, the ECB, review its requirements?   The interest rate risk of European banks can’t be compared to that run by some US banks such as Silicon Valley Bank with a different business model. The repricing of loans, in other words, raising interest rates in line with the market rate, has been much faster than the repricing of deposits in Europe. However, the interest rates on deposits will also increase at some point.  So is interest rate risk adequately covered?  Yes, but at the same time banks will be facing a loss of profitability as I said. I am talking about the average for the sector.   There has been a lot of debate about interest rates on savings. Politicians are taking initiatives to get banks to raise interest rates. Is that a good idea?  If the ECB raises interest rates, it is for borrowers and savers. Lending rates have risen and the remuneration of deposits is expected to follow suit. The remuneration on savings accounts should reflect our interest rates. That is part of our monetary policy transmission. Because if savings become more attractive, consumers will spend less, reducing demand. This is what we aim for to push down inflation. However, we now see banks are delaying passing on higher interest rates to savers. They can do that because they still benefit from abundant liquidity right now. But we are also taking measures to reduce excess liquidity, so that higher interest rates on savings accounts will become a reality – sooner or later.  Do you see differences between member states in this respect?  Yes, there are differences. In some countries, banks are quick to adjust interest rates on deposits, and in others, such as Spain, they are lagging behind. Euro area banking sectors also differ in the way mortgage loans are granted, whether it is at variable or fixed rates. Strengthening of profitability was particularly notable for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates and the pass-through of higher policy rates to deposits has been slower.  And Belgium?  I know the Spanish situation because it’s my own country, but we look at euro area averages and developments as a whole.  Some economists criticise the system that allows banks to make money easily by depositing their excess liquidity with the ECB. This is resulting in generous profits at the moment because interest rates are rising. What’s your take on this?  The ECB has raised its interest rates with a view to these increases being passed on to all remuneration categories in bank balance sheets. The level of liquidity in the market was extremely high and had to be reduced. This reduction is under way now and will go hand-in-hand with a decline in these types of revenues for banks.  You have also changed the remuneration of the minimum reserve requirement for banks. Some bankers believe that this should be raised to ensure a stronger capital base. Do you think that’s a good idea?  We have indeed set the remuneration of banks’ minimum reserves to 0%. The levels of those reserves have so far not been changed or discussed. I know some central bank governors are in favour of increasing them. We have limited the remuneration on the minimum reserve requirement, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of banks’ liabilities. I understand that remuneration of reserves is important for some banks, but monetary policy shouldn’t be driven by the financial position of banks or the profits of the central banks. Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.  National central banks are going to have to report significant losses owing to the policy of quantitative easing, which led to huge purchases of sovereign bonds to inject liquidity into the market. Do these losses pose a problem?  It’s true that central banks are currently reporting losses owing to the hike in interest rates, but if we look at a longer period of time, for instance over the last 10 years, the net outcome is positive in terms of central bank profits.  What about the real estate market? People are complaining about the higher cost of loans. What would you say to them?   What is happening is part of our monetary policy. The sharp rise in interest rates is starting to dampen real estate prices. This is more apparent in some countries than others, but a moderation in price trends can be seen everywhere. On average, house prices are stabilising. The decline in commercial property prices is much more pronounced.   Does the situation pose a danger?   It could affect banks, but fortunately they are less exposed to commercial real estate than they are to residential real estate. Commercial real estate is more often financed through other channels, such as mutual funds. But in the financial system there is a high degree of interconnectedness, so we look at the overall picture.  Huge investments are needed to make homes and other buildings climate-proof. Are the higher interest rates delaying funding for investments aimed at combating climate change? Could that slow down the climate transition?  It’s true that substantial investments are needed, but I think they should mainly be financed through subsidies and European funds like the Next Generation EU. This is a matter for fiscal policy. That doesn’t alter the fact that the ECB conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing rates without discriminating between sectors or borrowers.   Monetary policy also affects the climate transition in other ways. Some investments are being jeopardised by higher financing costs. This has already resulted in plans for various wind farms being scrapped.  The ECB pays close attention to climate policy, but for us it’s a secondary objective. It’s national governments that play the leading role in climate policy, through taxes and subsidies. We can contribute though – and we do. For example, we prioritise climate-friendly companies in our corporate bond portfolio. This is a small contribution, but it sends a clear signal in the fight against climate change.  The ECB is preparing to introduce a digital euro. Why is that necessary?  We currently have a physical euro in our wallets, whereas the world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. There is a very natural evolution taking place from a physical to a digital euro backed by the central bank. We see the digital euro as a means of payment. We would be able to use this form of public money to pay for our shopping, our bill in a restaurant or all sorts of purchases. Like banknotes, the digital euro will not have to be remunerated. There will be a limit on the amount of digital euro people can hold, to avoid endangering the stability of the banking system. This means that the digital euro won’t compete with current accounts. That is a very clear message we want to send to the banking sector. The digital euro will not be an investment product but a simple means of payment to complement banknotes.  Won’t implementing the digital euro be very expensive for the ECB?  This will be part of our calculations during the preparation phase over the next two years, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted but, in my view, the benefits will outweigh the costs. It will offer another alternative means of payment to those living in the euro area. It will also enable us to take another step towards European strategic autonomy. And at the end of the preparation phase the decision will be taken by the European Commission, the European Council of the European Union and European Parliament.  A number of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, are struggling with how inflation is measured. The way it’s measured means actual inflation is sometimes overestimated and sometimes underestimated. Isn't that a problem for the ECB, as it’s tasked with fighting inflation?  Indeed, changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated. But that's a matter for Eurostat, not the ECB, and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward. Statistical changes to the compilation of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) occur from time to time. A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not. As you know, that was one of the conclusions of our monetary policy strategic review. We work and share information with Eurostat on that topic, with a view to enhancing the HICP. But not on the measurement of energy prices, which is a statistical choice to how the country’s price index is compiled.  Europe is planning to use the profits from frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear to help rebuild Ukraine. The ECB is critical of this. Can you explain why?  Let me first clarify that the ECB is in favour of helping and supporting Ukraine in any way possible. But our position on utilising the dividends and interest from the frozen assets is clear. First: this should be a global decision, ideally involving all members of the G7. In addition, we have to be careful because this could lead to reputational damage. We have to look beyond this conflict in isolation, and there could be implications for the euro as a safe currency. The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation. I think there are other ways to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In Belgium, the launch of the ethical bank NewB has proved very difficult. Are barriers to setting up new banks in the eurozone too high?  Without entering into the details of any particular case, there are different procedures to be followed and criteria to be met, but there are no limitations beyond the legal and capital requirements imposed for the creation of a new retail bank.  But there haven’t been very many new banks in the last few years...  Because there are a lot of banks in the euro area! The real question to ask is about banks’ traditional business model. New sources of revenue need to be found, the number of branches has to be reduced. I suppose that investors are turning away from banks because the level of profitability doesn’t meet their expectations. I think there needs to be further cross-border consolidation.  So are there too many banks?  Given the cost structure of European banks, consolidation could help provide a solution. Above all else, I think cross-border consolidation in the euro area under a single supervisor and within the framework of a single monetary policy would be positive.   "
2023-11-09,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Finance,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Albina Kenda","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Finance   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Albina Kenda 9 November 2023  The ECB did not change its key interest rates at its October meeting, interrupting the series of ten consecutive interest rate increases that had brought rates up by 4.5 percentage points since July 2022. A few days later Eurostat announced that euro area headline inflation had fallen to 2.9% in October. Does this mean that interest rate hikes are over?  It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level, and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2% level we define as price stability.  The evolution of inflation has been positive overall: it was above 10% only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9%. At the same time, core inflation has also been moderating. But we have to be prudent and cautious, as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months. We will continue taking a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions.   Euro area GDP was down by 0.1% in the third quarter, and economists think inflation may rise again over the coming months as the positive base effect will progressively fade out. At the same time, there is a risk of another commodity price shock arising from the situation in the Middle East. If the ECB finds itself at a crossroads, will it prioritise growth or inflation?  Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2%. Unlike some other central banks, the ECB does not have a dual mandate.  At the same time, we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation. We expect that growth will stagnate in the second half of the year and that the fourth quarter will not differ much from the third. Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth; some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.  Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025, with some fluctuations caused by base effects. However, we believe that, if interest rates are maintained at their current levels, inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.   The ECB will publish new forecasts in December. Will these be more or less the same as in September, or are you expecting upward revisions for inflation and downward revisions for growth?   It might be premature to say it, but leading indicators point to the growth outlook being somewhat more negative than we previously projected. As regards inflation, the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.  You mentioned the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to decision-making. But in October the ECB said it considers its key interest rates to be at levels that will make a substantial contribution to lowering inflation, provided they are maintained at those levels for a sufficiently long duration. What is meant by “sufficiently long”?  This means a period of time that takes into account the potential lags of monetary policy. Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive, and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down, as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was. I would not define “sufficiently long” as used in our monetary policy statement as a concrete period of time. We will need to determine this on the basis of data. In our decision-making we will also have to take into account the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical risks related to the conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine.  But what kind of data would the ECB need to see to start reducing interest rates rather than simply keeping them at restrictive levels?  We are not there yet. We will see how things evolve month by month, but our approach now is to keep interest rates at this level long enough to reach our target. Any discussion about lowering interest rates is clearly premature.  To what extent did the ECB’s monetary policy take into account not just the euro area average but the situation in individual Member States, as there are significant differences among them, also in their level of inflation. According to Eurostat, in October Slovakia recorded the highest inflation rate of 7.8%, Slovenia registered 6.6%, while the Netherlands and Belgium recorded deflation of 1% and 1.7% respectively.  We have seen disparities among euro area countries in their economic and financial structures, in the weight of services in their economies and not least in their proximity to the conflict in Ukraine.      There are always differences in inflation and growth, but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries. Our measure of price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.  In dealing with the disparities, it is important to consider the effects of fiscal policies. With regard to base effects, we have to look at how governments have introduced, and have started to withdraw, support measures to mitigate the shocks of the energy crisis. Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries. But our monetary policy is single.  The ECB is now looking more closely, in line with other central banks, at core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. What are ECB’s main concerns in this regard? ECB President Christine Lagarde said this summer that profit margins contributed almost two-thirds to domestic inflation last year. Almost nobody mentions this anymore, but there is now a discussion about the effects of wage increases.   It is essential to focus on core inflation, for which there are several risks. First, there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation. Second, there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate, which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation. And finally, there are unit labour costs. Rising labour costs result from two factors. The first one is wage developments, with wage growth in the euro area now at just over 5%. The second is productivity, which is very low and has been declining because employment growth has been outpacing output growth.  It is true that profit margins grew even faster than unit labour costs last year. This year, however, we are seeing a moderation in profit margins, while labour costs are on the rise.  Our expectation is that part of the increase in labour costs will be absorbed via profit margins, meaning that not all of this increase will be passed through to final prices.   At the ECB, you are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to deepen your understanding of inflation. What will you do differently from what you have been doing so far and what do you hope to achieve? We know that, while not the only one, you have been wrong as far as the inflation forecast is concerned.   Our colleagues working with statistics deal with a lot of information, a lot of data on the financial system and the real economy, so any instrument that helps us manage this monumental amount of information is very useful.  So we are continually looking for algorithms that can give us a better understanding of what is happening in the economy, in the financial system, and a way of factoring in all the underlying tendencies that are embedded in the data we analyse.   There have been warnings that in its fight against inflation the ECB has been focusing only on the demand side of the economy, while supply-side factors also contribute to inflation. Is a more balanced approach warranted for the future, bearing in mind the pressures that may stem from geopolitical tensions, the demographic picture and the implications of the Green Deal? The economy has already been disrupted, is monetary policy next?  Sometimes it is important to stress that monetary policy works through interest rate increases, through the transmission of monetary policy decisions to financing conditions and then through the impact of financing conditions on aggregate demand.  So, monetary policy and the transmission of its decisions aim to influence aggregate demand, consumption and investment. Monetary policy cannot deal with supply-side issues. These need to be addressed through structural policies and fiscal policies.  Let me add that it’s not only the origin of inflation that’s important, but also the possibility of second-round effects, which can make the situation much more complicated, with a possible price-wage-profit spiral. In particular, we need to avoid de-anchoring inflation expectations, as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.  It was announced a while ago that the ECB, in cooperation with Eurostat, would include housing costs in the calculation of inflation. How far along is this project?  This was part of the ECB’s strategy review, and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation. However, such costs need to be well calibrated in the index, and this is mainly Eurostat’s responsibility. Including the cost of owner-occupied housing in the measurement – known as the owner-occupied property cost – contributes to the calibration of inflation. We are very willing to cooperate with Eurostat and provide our input and insights.   So there is no deadline?  It is not up to us. But there is a need for harmonised action at EU level, not just in the euro area, and this takes time.   The ECB has dealt with record-high euro area inflation by raising interest rates at a record pace. In the banking systems of several countries, including Slovenia, borrowers have felt the effects of this policy much more than savers. Is this also due to the consolidation of the banking market and the subsequent lack of competition?   You are right about the effects. As you know, we have made it crystal clear: whenever we raise our key interest rates, this increase should be passed on to all sides of the market.  The current situation can be explained by several factors. First, there is excess liquidity, so banks haven’t been under pressure to raise the remuneration of deposits. However, liquidity conditions are becoming less and less comfortable for European banks – there have been changes to the parameters for long-term liquidity lending to banks under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and changes to our bond-buying programmes, so the decline in liquidity will continue. Second, banks are always slower to change their pricing policy for deposits than they are for loans.  But there is a slow-but-steady increase in the remuneration of deposits, particularly time deposits. We believe that this process will continue. We are monitoring it very closely and, I’ll say it again, when we raise interest rates, we are not only raising them for borrowers, but for savers too, because otherwise the transmission of monetary policy would be incomplete.   Given that deposit interest rates lagging behind lending rates has resulted in considerable growth in banks’ net interest income, could you say that banks are pursuing short-term goals instead of long-term sustainable business goals, especially as you said yourself that the ECB is now determined to reduce excess liquidity in the system?  You’re right – the profitability of European banks has improved recently owing to the increase in key interest rates and an improvement in profit margins.  However, this has not been reflected in the market valuation of banks because markets believe that this improvement in profitability may not be sustainable over time. First, because the economy is slowing, which could lead to an increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Second, because the drop in demand for loans would reduce banks’ revenues. And third, because the cost of funding for banks is rising.  So I think that it’s quite obvious that, despite the improved profitability of banks, there are doubts about how sustainable this will be in the longer term.   What are the challenges to financial stability in the euro area now that we are in a phase of economic slowdown? What is the situation regarding insolvency proceedings, non-performing loans and risks to the banking system stemming from the real estate market? In Germany, residential property prices fell by around 10% in the second quarter. Do you expect a correction elsewhere as a consequence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening?  When interest rates go up, the financial stability situation changes. The first factor we have to look at is valuations of financial assets and real estate assets. One of the main risks we see in terms of financial stability in the euro area is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment of asset prices and the implications it could have for banks. It should be stressed that banks are in a good position in terms of profitability, capital and liquidity. But we cannot be complacent because, as I said, there are some doubts about how sustainable this improvement is going to be over time.  There is another factor for financial stability. We look very carefully at non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly real estate mutual funds. In this regard, we have seen a significant drop in commercial real estate valuations. This decline had set in before the start of the monetary policy tightening but has now accelerated following the rise in interest rates. A number of non-bank financial intermediaries have seen very steep declines, particularly in commercial real estate.  In addition to economic cooling, we are also witnessing a housing crisis across the EU. How do you respond to the criticism that the ECB’s monetary policy has contributed to this, first with bond purchases that lowered bond yields, which led institutional investors to turn to the property market for returns, and now by increasing borrowing costs, which has caused many building projects to be postponed or completely abandoned?  We can be criticised for being too lenient or for being too tough. But, if I may say, I don’t think it’s fair to be criticised for both things at the same time. There were reasons why we had a very expansionary monetary policy – think back to the pandemic and the decline in GDP. I think that without our monetary policy, the situation would have been much worse. Going back even further, to the era of quantitative easing, you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis. However, sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge, and we had to respond.  Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability. Sometimes there are lateral effects. But there are also other policies to deal with a potential real estate bubble, such as fiscal and macroprudential policies.   In other words, you are looking at developments in the real estate market through the prism of the financial stability of the banking system.  For sure. My point is that monetary policy has to be focused on price stability. However, there are other instruments available, like fiscal and other policies. In the event of real estate market growth that is not fully aligned with fundamentals, macroprudential policies can be applied, bank capital buffers can be increased and borrower-based measures can be used to limit excessive growth in real estate lending. A range of policies are available.   What are the latest trends in the credit situation in the euro area?  The evolution is quite clear: financing conditions have tightened as a result of our monetary policy decisions, resulting in a decline in credit demand, which can be seen for both households and firms. This is how monetary policy works.   My last question is on the tax issue. Banks are reporting high profits, largely due to higher net interest income. As a result, several governments have decided to levy additional taxes on them. Why is the ECB not in favour?  Our decision is based on two pillars. The first is that this kind of tax should not impair lending or the transmission of monetary policy measures to the system. The second is that such a tax should not damage the solvency of banks, as this could have medium-term consequences for banks that are not well capitalised.  We have already issued opinions for Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and now Slovenia. The taxes are not all the same, but each opinion points out that the tax should not impair lending and should not damage the solvency of banks.      "
2023-11-04,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Kathimerini,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Alexis Papahelas on 30 October","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Kathimerini   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Alexis Papahelas on 30 October 4 November 2023  When you were in Athens last week, you talked about Greece’s resilience and its phenomenal recovery capacity. Could you tell me how this happened? How did Greece become a success story?  When I look at the key performance indicators for assessing Greece’s economic and financial situation, I see improvements across the board: in employment, growth, the fiscal situation and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Greece has completed many of the reforms on its to-do list. Not all of them, of course. There is still more work to be done. I understand that there are more reforms in the pipeline but, overall, the results of the country’s efforts are impressive. And this did not go unnoticed by those whose job it is to rate an economy and assess its credit rating – as shown by the two recent decisions that raised Greece’s rating to investment grade. I think it’s a tremendous testament to the country’s efforts. The turnaround was thanks to the fiscal adjustments and the reforms that were implemented, but also to the resolute efforts of the Greek people and the Greek authorities.  Is the high debt-to-GDP ratio of any concern to you?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is around 160% at the moment. It has fallen significantly in the last couple of years. And obviously this downward trend needs to continue in the future. I know there is more to come, but Greece has evidently responded to this challenge with determination, and the results are already clear to see.  Did you ever get really worried about Grexit? Did you think that it was possible?  There were two particular moments where the threat could have materialised. The first was during the French G20 presidency in November 2011, when there was talk of a possible referendum, which didn’t happen in the end. The second, when the threat was much more tangible and much more worrying, was in July 2015. So, we had two Grexit threats, but the one in 2015 was the most concrete, and if it hadn’t been for the determination of a few European leaders, it would have happened.  You had a front-row seat to the Greek financial crisis from a very early stage. When you look back, do you think that any mistakes were made?  The original mistake was for the country to have found itself in that situation. If there had been greater fiscal discipline and if the prudent principle of establishing a rainy-day fund for bad times when the economy was doing well had been applied, the crisis might not have happened. The fiscal policies in place before and after the crisis hit in 2009 were the original mistakes. As I have said before, it would have been helpful for the IMF to have had longer programmes than those available in its arsenal. The programmes it had were intended for rapid and deep changes, reforms and fiscal consolidation. At the time they weren’t necessarily the best tools for a country that was in a monetary union without a fiscal union or for Greece’s specific fiscal situation.  Did you learn any lessons or draw any conclusions of your own from the crisis?  One very pertinent lesson is to make sure that we have the collective discipline to address the lack of a fiscal union. I think this should be a very pressing concern for all of us. When you have a monetary union without a fiscal union, as we do, you need clear fiscal guardrails and a fiscal framework within which countries can design and implement their fiscal policies and be accountable to the other members of the monetary union. Something else that stands out from the Greek situation is that decisions were made but then sometimes reversed by the subsequent political team. And, even when decisions were taken, the implementation and monitoring needed to move forward didn’t always happen. Another lesson is that, even when banks are not the cause of a crisis, a solid and robust financial sector with well-capitalised banks is crucial.  Are you satisfied with the current state of the Greek banking system?  I think a lot of work has been done to consolidate and strengthen the Greek banking sector. Take non-performing loans, for example. In 2016 almost 50% of loans were non-performing. Now it is just over 8%. That is a significant sign of improvement, which has involved parking those non-performing loans outside the banks. So, in a way, the banking system has been sanitised. Capital ratios are much stronger, non-performing loans have gone down and liquidity ratios are also quite solid. So yes, a lot has been done to make Greek banks more robust and more attractive.  I think the fact that a large foreign bank is taking an interest in a Greek bank is a clear indication that the sector has become more attractive.  Do you think 10 or 12 years ago it would have been possible for you and the Governor of the Bank of Greece Yannis Stournaras to take a walk around Syntagma Square where all the demonstrations were happening? What was going through your mind when you actually did it this time?  I was totally bemused by the transformation, I have to tell you. As you know, I did not come to Greece at the height of the crisis, but I was obviously in frequent contact with the team. I was following the IMF mission’s visits very closely – special security measures were taken and it was a source of anxiety and concern. Now, to walk down the street, say hello to people and feel their energy, vitality and optimism was quite striking. It is a testament to the effort and the determination of the Greeks to turn things around and to take hold of their destiny with the discipline and seriousness required in a union like the EU. I think it’s fantastic that Greece can set standards and be an example of what to do, of what reforms to implement.  Do you have the sense that economic events are driven by geopolitics these days? How hard is it to carry out fiscal and, more importantly, monetary policy?  You and I have been around for a little while. And I think that geopolitics taking precedence over many other developments is nothing new. What I think is slightly different now is that there is a compounded effect of multiple geopolitical developments taking place in various corners of the world. Sometimes they are a reflection of a major schism happening in front of us. When the world had a bipolar power structure, when it was fairly organised and settled, you could anticipate things. You could have more certainty about future developments. Now it’s far more fragmented. Crises are taking place in various parts of the globe at the same time, and it’s not clear who is on whose side and what the next development will be, let alone the final outcome of the current crisis in the Middle East. And if you add to that the crisis that we have just gone through with the pandemic, plus the terribly serious challenge of climate change, which is a tragedy that is already unfolding, that’s a lot of geopolitical and climate-related developments taking place together. That’s what’s making it even harder at the moment, which is why I think that we are confronted with shifts and breaks that, although not unimaginable, certainly fly in the face of the traditional way of thinking or the certainties that we used to have.  Do you think that inflation will recede next year?  This is certainly our forecast and this is certainly our goal. We are determined to bring inflation down to 2%. According to our projections we will get there in 2025.  It seems as though increases in food prices and housing are almost becoming structural now. Are you worried about the political implications of all this, about the political pressures stemming from the rise in the cost of living?  When we measure inflation, we pay attention to the headline rate, which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing – how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car, food on the table, or to have clothes, shelter and everything else. But we also try to understand what is underneath the most variable components. One of those components is food. Is the price of food going to be higher in the future? That’s a possibility if you look at the impact of climate change, for example. Droughts, floods, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will most likely have an impact on food prices going forward .  As for the political implications that you asked me about, let me say that our mandate is to ensure price stability, and this is the best contribution we can make to social peace and to society, to the most vulnerable of its members in particular.  The last question I’d like to ask you is what really keeps you up at night?  I try to sleep as much as I can, and at the moment it’s not a lot, I have to say. When I go to bed, I’m really tired and I fall asleep. But what preoccupies me before I go to bed is the level of violence, hatred and hubris around, which is first and foremost terrible for people – terrible for children and terrible for civilians. And of course, in addition to the human suffering, all this will have an impact on our economies, on the level of people’s confidence, and it will probably make our job a little bit harder going forward.

2023-10-16,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marcel de Boer, Marijn Jongsma and Joost van Kuppeveld on 11 October 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad   Interview with Philip R. Lane, member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marcel de Boer, Marijn Jongsma and Joost van Kuppeveld on 11 October 2023 16 October 2023  Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.  First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.  What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?  This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.  Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?  What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.  Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.  We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.  QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?  We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate. This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.  Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?   Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.  So no lowering of interest rates until spring?  We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.  And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?  Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.   As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?  I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty. And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.  Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?  I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.    "
2023-10-08,Christine Lagarde,Interview with La Tribune Dimanche,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie-Pierre Gröndahl on 2 October 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with La Tribune Dimanche   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie-Pierre Gröndahl on 2 October 2023 8 October 2023  The ECB raised its key interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in fourteen months, bringing the rate on the deposit facility to 4%, its highest level since the launch of the euro. Coming at a time when people are concerned about the level of interest rates, was this move justified?   We first need to put the action taken by the European Central Bank into context. For several years now the world has been facing a “permacrisis”, a constant succession of serious and unprecedented crises − in terms of their scale, their impact and the speed at which they emerged. The health crisis was followed by Russia’s unjustified war in Ukraine, and then by an acceleration in inflation. All this against the backdrop of the energy crisis, with a number of EU countries experiencing difficulties in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, including real estate.  The ECB’s mandate, unchanged for 25 years, is price stability. It’s our compass. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.     Do you have the tools you need to fight inflation?   Our models were not perfectly suited to the nature of these crises, which resulted, among other things, in the complete shutdown of part of the economy during the health crisis, leading to a greater role for governments, which suddenly became protective. They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades, or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation. The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections. We have worked on these issues, and we are continuing to do so, in order to make the projections more robust.   Have the past projection errors dented trust in the ECB’s actions?    Close to 80% of euro area citizens believe in and support the euro. And 45% trust the ECB, slightly more than did so before the health crisis. But we are constantly seeking effective methods and better channels of communication to explain our actions and counter fake news, which spreads far more quickly than the facts, also in the economic world. The ECB was the first central bank to acknowledge its errors with regard to the projections and to analyse the reasons for them.   And what are these reasons?  The errors were largely caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. Growth has declined across all economies – in advanced, emerging and developing countries. And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world, apart from in China. A very worrying situation, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6% in October 2022, more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3%. That means that within one year, the efforts made – along with base effects, i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago – have slowed the pace of inflation.  But that’s not the general feeling in Europe…  It’s hard to explain that the rise in prices is slowing down. Inflation persists, but it is abating and even steadily declining. That’s good news. I think our efforts have played a part in this, as have some of the economic policies pursued in Europe. At the same time, growth is weakening, which is why the International Monetary Fund has revised down its growth projections worldwide, except for the United States.  Why this gap with Europe?    Potential growth in the United States has traditionally exceeded that of Europe or of the euro area by close to 1 percentage point on average. It’s not meaningful to compare them: you can’t compare a single country with several countries. The euro area comprises 20 different countries, 20 different fiscal policies, 20 different treasuries. For a start, the United States is protected by the dollar, an international reference currency. The US economy is far more responsive and adjusts more rapidly. And it is not energy-dependent, unlike Europe, which has to import 80% of its energy.   Growth is falling in Europe. Is there a risk of recession?  We have revised down our growth projections to 0.7% in 2023, 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. The rate for 2025 is only slightly below the potential growth of the euro area. In Europe, we have devised a response and deployed unprecedented defensive measures that would have been unimaginable just three years ago, notably thanks to the Next Generation EU programme. Structural reforms are being put in place. And, just one year ago, who would have thought that we would succeed in replenishing more than 90% of our gas reserves by September 2023? This allows us to look towards the coming winter, if not calmly, then at least with a lot more confidence.   The German economy, the largest in the euro area, is slowing down sharply. What impact will this have?  This is one of the factors that is indeed weighing on the outlook for European growth. Germany had built its economic model on very cheap energy supplies and on export opportunities, especially to China. The ongoing adjustment in the German economy is affecting the growth outlook.   Does that complicate the ECB’s mission?  First and foremost, the ECB has to answer the question of how to provide price stability for economic actors across the entire euro area. To this end, we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area, as well as underlying inflation – excluding energy and food.  In France, people are acutely aware of inflation. Why is that?  High and persistent inflation affects people’s purchasing power. But overall, while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average, for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.  Is this also due to the rise in interest rates?  Not exclusively. The ECB rates are the same for France as for all euro area countries. We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.  Doesn’t this threaten growth?  Our mandate is price stability, and interest rates are our tool. We raise rates to make the financing of economic activity more expensive in a manner that dampens demand, and to thus bring about an adjustment between supply and demand, notably through reduced investment and consumption. The goal is obviously not to create a recession, but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and, above all, prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral. We must avoid this at all costs. We want to get inflation back to 2%, and we will achieve that.  Is there a risk of a wage-price spiral?  We aren’t seeing that for the moment, but we are monitoring it closely. Wage growth is expected to be around 5.3% in the euro area in 2023, and that figure is projected to be 4.3% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2% over the coming years.  Is the housing crisis that is picking up pace in France and Germany collateral damage from monetary policy?  The ECB sets the key interest rates in view of its price stability mandate. The housing sector is indeed sensitive to interest rates. But for many of the problems, all authorities need to get around the table and think about the stock of housing supply, and about social housing in particular. The fact remains that the major risk would be if people get into debt without having adequate means and are then confronted with repayment deadlines they cannot meet.  Is the ECB pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook?  There are three reasons why we are not pessimistic. We expect growth figures to increase next year. Inflation is currently falling significantly. And the employment rate is higher than it’s ever been in Europe, and it’s stabilising at that level. The big question right now concerns businesses. Will they accept absorbing part of the salary increases that will be negotiated this year and next in their margins – which didn’t change much in 2022? This is a key question. In our economic projections, we assume that businesses will behave as they have done during previous crises, in that they will reduce their margins a little in order to absorb part of the salary increases. The fall in demand should point them in that direction. It’s in their interest to do so, as public opinion will put them under pressure, as will the public authorities. The second element that is very important is energy prices. I think we have to get used to the idea that oil prices will remain high. This should spur us to pursue the fight against climate change even more vigorously, and to shift towards an energy mix that is less dependent on fossil fuels and foreign suppliers.  Anxiety is growing in European society in the face of a number of measures taken to fight climate change. How should we react?  We cannot wait. Combating climate change is imperative – we should all be hammering that message home. Everyone needs to realise it’s an emergency. We will only achieve this energy transition if we have everyone’s support, and with distributive policies that don’t worsen inequality. We cannot allow the energy transition to fail. Nor can we allow the consequences of climate change to become long-lasting. That is not an option. We have to find the fiscal and social means to make it as painless as possible for everyone, and for the most vulnerable in particular. A collective approach is needed. If there is any area where Europeans should borrow collectively, invest and share the burden as equally as possible, it’s the fight against climate change.  What will follow the current version of the Stability and Growth Pact?  I hope the European Heads of State or Government and the finance ministers will reach an agreement before the end of the year. The sooner there is an agreement on a reformed fiscal framework, the earlier we have clarity on the path of fiscal policies going forward.      "
2023-10-06,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Jutarnji list,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marina Klepo on 29 September 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Jutarnji list   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marina Klepo on 29 September 2023 6 October 2023    From the ECB's perspective, have the new [September inflation] data brought about any changes in terms of the drivers of inflation growth?    Overall, the recent news on inflation is encouraging. Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably, and it now stands at 4.3% after peaking at 10.6% in October of last year. A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks, as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly. It is also a consequence of statistical effects, the so-called base effects, given that we had unusually large price increases a year ago. When it comes to core inflation, which excludes energy and food, it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5% in the euro area, hence above headline inflation. However, its September print was lower than expected.  It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly, but it is still well above our target of 2%, which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, that “last kilometre” may well prove to be the hardest.  How worrying is the oil price increase that we have witnessed in recent months?  The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on, because we could have new supply side shocks stemming, for instance, from energy or food prices. This year, we’ve experienced frequent extreme weather events, which may have an impact on harvests and lead to higher food prices next year. In addition, the base effects from energy may eventually reverse, putting upside pressure on inflation. Therefore,  we must not be complacent, and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.  What does it mean for the broad expectations among economists, the financial markets and even among central banks, that there will be no need for further interest rate hikes? That’s at least how the latest ECB messages have been interpreted.  One has to look carefully at what we communicated. We said that our decisions will continue to be data dependent. Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2%. However,  we cannot say that we are at the peak or for how long rates will need to be kept at restrictive levels. This will depend on the data, so we will continue to look at three factors: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all of them are moving in the right direction. But I still see upside risks to inflation. There could be new supply side shocks. Moreover, wages could grow more strongly than expected, potentially accompanied by lower-than-expected productivity growth, while firms might not absorb those higher costs through their profit margins. Such risks need to be monitored carefully. If they materialised, further interest rate hikes could be necessary at some point.  Even though inflation has slowed considerably, there are still major differences in inflation rates among countries, ranging from negative numbers in the Netherlands to almost 9% in Slovakia. To what extent do these differences affect the setting of monetary policy? Are they really taken into account?  Our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. Naturally, our monetary policy decisions also take into account information from individual Member States, but we cannot respond to specific developments in a particular country. Such developments are best tackled by national policies, such as fiscal or structural policies. The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation. There are several reasons for the large role played by energy: First, countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation. Second, governments responded differently to the energy price shock, with some governments imposing price controls, which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on. Of course, these measures also had different fiscal implications, because some of them expire automatically when energy prices fall, while others need to be actively reversed, which typically takes longer. And finally, the institutional characteristics of energy markets differ across Member States. In some of them, wholesale energy prices translate quickly into retail prices, both when energy prices rise and fall. In other countries the response is more sluggish due to the fact that there are fixed-price contracts in place with a long duration. One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices, which constitute a large share of the consumption basket. This heterogeneity complicates our monetary policy, but we nevertheless need to focus on the euro area as a whole.  The government in Croatia, as well as in some other countries, is trying to introduce price controls on energy and certain basic consumer items. What is your view of these measures, what are the good and the bad sides of such an approach to lowering inflationary pressures?  Measures that directly control prices, such as price caps, have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which may be reversed once the measures are lifted. This helps to smooth inflation over time, but it also distorts the steering effect of prices. This may be counterproductive, because it does not incentivise lower consumption, for example, of energy. In addition, such measures can weigh heavily on the fiscal budget, especially if they are broad-based rather than targeting the more vulnerable groups. In general, measures that increase the supply capacity are preferable to those that directly control prices.  But do they work in the short run?  In the short run, they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation, which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers, as these often depend on current developments in inflation. But overall, the negative effects often outweigh the positive.   One of the problems in Croatia, which has one of the highest inflation rates in the euro area, seems to lie in ample excess liquidity in the banking sector. This has increased strongly since Croatia joined the euro area on account of banks’ lower minimum reserve requirements. The argument is that this impedes the transmission of higher ECB interest rates and prevents a stronger impact on inflation. What do your analyses on the success of monetary policy transmission in Member States indicate?  What matters for monetary policy in a currency union is excess liquidity at the euro area level and not at the country level. Excess liquidity in the euro area is very high, but this does not impede monetary policy transmission. We have seen that the increases in our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, have been fully transmitted to the money market and have translated into a measurable increase in funding costs in the economy. But you are right, monetary policy transmission can play out differently across Member States. One crucial factor is the prevalence of variable versus fixed-rate loans. The average lending rates adjust more quickly if there is a higher share of loans with a variable interest rate. Croatia is a special case, given that it joined the euro just recently. The drop in minimum reserve requirements from a level of 9% to 1% led to an increase in excess liquidity in the system. However, the strong loan growth that we are seeing in Croatia is not related to this but to the relatively strong economic performance, which is partly driven by the boom in tourism. That is why the Croatian National Bank decided to further increase the countercyclical capital buffer for banks to counter excessive loan growth. This is another way of dealing with the heterogeneity in a currency union, using macroprudential tools at the national level.  Would that be in the national central bank’s domain?  Yes, these macroprudential tools are mainly decided at national rather than European level – in Croatia’s case by the central bank – so they can be adjusted to the specific situation in a given country.   Do you see tourism as the main contributor to economic growth and credit activity in Croatia?  It is definitely one of the factors driving growth in Croatia’s economy. It has always been a very attractive place for summer holidays, and its attractiveness has probably increased since it joined the euro area. Two of my daughters, for example, travelled to Croatia recently, not only because it is beautiful, but also because it now has the euro.  The general public is concerned by the fact that banks are faring the best under the current circumstances, because they are generating high income from central banks without any effort or risk.   This is related to the high volume of excess liquidity created by our previous monetary policy actions: the lending operations and bond purchases, which we call quantitative easing. Excess liquidity is remunerated at our deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. In line with our interest rate tightening, we have now started to shrink our balance sheet, and this is happening very quickly, even though the balance sheet is still very large.  We need to pay interest on reserves, at least at the margin, to make sure that short-term money market rates are closely anchored to our policy rate and therefore in line with our intended monetary policy stance. Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control. Now, what seems to create most of the unease is that banks raised their lending rates much more quickly than they passed these increases on to their depositors. But this transmission is getting stronger. Rates on time deposits have risen quite a bit, and we also see that people are beginning to shift their funds out of sight deposits into alternative investments that pay higher interest rates.  This market mechanism eventually forces banks to adjust their deposit rates. But this also means that banks’ funding costs will go up over time. Even though the impact on profitability is very positive in the short run, longer-term consequences of higher interest rates on bank profitability may well prove to be less benign, because the interest income on bank assets may rise more slowly than their funding costs.  The ECB recently abolished the remuneration paid to banks on minimum reserves, but there are proposals for an increase in the minimum reserve requirement ratio at euro area level to reduce liquidity in the system. What is your view on this?     In July, we had a comprehensive discussion on the minimum reserve requirements and their remuneration. We came to the conclusion that, from a monetary policy perspective, it would be appropriate to keep them at a level of 1% but to remunerate them at 0% instead of applying the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. Let me stress three points.  First, our main tool for adjusting our monetary stance is our policy rates and not minimum reserve requirements. Second, minimum reserve requirements are linked to the volume of deposits, which means that they mainly affect banks with high holdings of deposits rather than those with high holdings of excess liquidity. Therefore, they tend to put a larger burden on smaller banks. Also, these higher reserve requirements may lead to “avoidance strategies” by banks, which could remunerate deposits by even less or shift them to entities outside the euro area, where there are no minimum reserve requirements. Lastly, we are currently discussing the design of our future operational framework for monetary policy implementation. As long as we do not know the role that minimum reserve requirements will play in this new framework, we should be cautious about making any far-reaching decisions.  In any case, the reduction of excess liquidity through the shrinking of our balance sheet will continue for some time and, eventually, all our asset purchase programmes will go into full run-off.   Economic growth prospects have worsened quite substantially, with the possibility of recession not being excluded from forecasts. What is your understanding of the drivers and the consequences of this recent deterioration in the business climate?  Over recent months, we have seen that most economic indicators point to a slowing growth momentum. We first saw a pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector, which started to spread to the services sector as the reopening effects from the pandemic faded. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for manufacturing are in deeply contractionary territory, and those for services are also signalling contraction. Consumer confidence has increased notably over the past year but remains at low levels. All this is pointing to subdued economic developments over the rest of this year.  While a technical recession cannot be excluded, there are no indications of a deep or prolonged downturn. One reason is the labour market, which is still quite resilient, resulting in strong nominal wage growth. As inflation falls, real incomes are rising, which supports economic growth going forward. What is clear is that our monetary policy will continue to have a dampening effect on economic growth.  So, there is no reason for concern of a deeper recession setting in?    We see indications of a period of stagnation but not of a deep or prolonged recession.  Still, the state of the economy in Germany, as a country that is a very important export market for many EU Member States, is not encouraging. How justified are the claims that Germany is currently the “sick man of Europe”?   Germany is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. Its economy has been hit twice: by the energy price shock and by weaker growth in China. This has exposed structural weaknesses linked to the dependence on cheap energy and on a booming economy in China that was eager to buy German manufacturing products. On top of this, Germany faces challenges regarding demographic developments, as it has a rapidly ageing society implying an increasing scarcity of labour, as well as the green transition which, as in many other countries, is facing political obstacles. Cyclical factors, i.e. weak domestic and foreign demand, will eventually fade, but the structural factors may weigh on potential growth and hence have longer-term effects. All this implies that  Germany, as is the case with many other countries, will need to adjust its business model to the changing global conditions, as well as to its domestic challenges.  How likely do you think that is?  Germany has managed to transform itself in the past and I am confident that it will be able to do so today. Naturally, this requires strategic thinking and openness to change. In particular, the green transition offers Germany vast opportunities to regain its technological leadership. The economy will pick up eventually, but the main issue concerns long-term potential growth, and that depends very much on how Germany tackles its structural challenges.  Arguments that the global economy is generally entering a phase of weak growth and disinflation are gaining ground. What do you see as having the most impact on inflation looking ahead?  What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics. When input costs rose sharply, many firms raised their prices in excess of the cost increase. So we saw an increase in profits in many sectors, also due to temporary supply-demand imbalances caused by bottlenecks and reopening effects. As a result of rising prices, employees experienced a drop in real wages. Now employees are trying to regain lost purchasing power, and tight labour market conditions are making it easier for the unions to negotiate higher wage increases. It is through such second-round effects that inflation becomes more persistent. The weakening of the economy, which is partly due to monetary policy transmission, makes it harder for firms to pass through higher wage costs to prices, meaning they may need to absorb higher costs through their profit margins. We see indications that this is happening. How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation, particularly underlying inflation, will be going forward.   There is a major difference of opinion as to how corporate profit margins over the last period have spurred inflation growth, with some analyses pointing to the conclusion that they were totally irrelevant.  Inflation is not only the result of rising wages or higher energy prices. Profits have also increased quite a lot over recent years. Looking ahead, the question is by how much wages will increase and to what extent rising wage costs will be absorbed by profit margins. It is only natural to expect that the unions and employees will try to regain some of the lost purchasing power and that wages will grow. But it is crucial how firms respond, and that depends on demand conditions and hence on our monetary policy.  Fiscal policy is expected to be prudent and cautious in order to curb inflation. However, politicians have their own concerns, such as a decline in the living standards of their citizens and in investment. On account of its widening fiscal deficit, Italy is again in the spotlight, and so is an increase in its bond yields. How does one reconcile these opposing goals?  We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years, which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures. However, we have also learnt over the years that consolidation should not come at the expense of necessary public investments. What really matters is the composition of public spending, which should aim to make the economy more productive and to strengthen the supply capacity. This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term. Therefore, it would be unwise to postpone public investments and structural reforms that are necessary to transform the economy. This is where the European funds come into play. The Next Generation EU programme can help countries to continue investing in their future. At the same time, the perception that the government can counter every economic shock through fiscal transfers is dangerous and could lead to unsustainable fiscal dynamics.    When it comes to recent yield movements in global financial markets, the largest part is driven by a general repricing of longer-term rates, as markets are anticipating interest rates to be held at a high level over a longer period of time. These higher funding costs imply that governments need to be even more prudent.  The ECB’s position that the price of borrowing will remain high for as long as necessary to reach the target inflation rate has been communicated quite clearly. Nevertheless, is there anything else that can be said in that context?     Our policy is data dependent, which implies that the level and duration of restrictive rates will depend on how the data develop. What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner. That is then also embedded in inflation expectations. One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly “anchored” around our target, in spite of painfully high inflation rates. Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.   "
2023-10-02,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold 2 October 2023  It’s been two weeks since the ECB raised rates for the tenth consecutive time, have you now done enough to tame inflation?  Let me stress an issue, which is sometimes slightly overlooked but is a very important part of the discussion, namely the transmission of monetary policy. That's crucial in order to understand the decisions that we have taken and those that we will take. In transmission you have two different legs. The first one is from our monetary policy decisions to financial markets and banks. In that first stage, the transmission is almost complete. You can see it. In the banking channel, there has been a tightening of financing conditions following our decisions. And there has been a significant drop in the demand for credit.  The second phase is how the impact of the tightening of financing conditions feeds through to the real economy. And here there is much more uncertainty. We have seen a slowdown in economic activity. But there are other factors behind that, for instance the impact of inflation on households’ disposable income and the evolution of exports, which is related to the slowdown in the global economy. The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy, and indirectly to inflation. That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates, if maintained over time, will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.   Do you worry about the risks of overdoing the tightening of monetary policy and driving the economy into an unnecessarily painful recession?   We do not at all want to create an unnecessarily painful recession. We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy. This is, at the end of the day, a very delicate balance. If the transmission is incomplete, then we should be a little more patient. If the transmission is much closer to completion, then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.   Does the recent rise in oil and gas prices, coupled with a weaker euro, make your task more difficult?   Yes, it makes our task more difficult. I would not say that it is a game changer. But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.   What would it take for the ECB to start cutting rates?   Well, we are not there.   But what would you need to see?   First of all, progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability, i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way. Starting to talk about rate cuts now is premature. We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Still, I think the last stretch is going to be more difficult. We are on our way towards 2 per cent. That’s clear. But we must monitor that very closely, as the last mile will not be easy.   But would the last mile be the hardest to achieve in bringing inflation down?  First let’s look at the factors in favour of disinflation. Base effects have an impact. Supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away. And there is monetary policy and the clear slowdown in the economy. In the second half of the year the economy in the euro area will have stagnated.  Now let’s turn to factors against disinflation. There’s a spike in oil prices. Wages are growing about 5 per cent on average. Demand for services is high, even though we have started to see a clear slowdown. And the euro has depreciated.  So, when you put all this in the balance, our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months. But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.   Are governments making inflation worse by continuing to run big deficits?   The first factor with respect to fiscal policy is the withdrawal of the subsidies granted over the last two years, which must be completed before the end of 2023. But it’s not only that. There is also the fiscal stance, which sometimes gets overlooked. My impression is that after four years without EU fiscal rules, governments may have got used to a little bit of a “whatever it takes” approach with respect to fiscal policy. But that has to change. Having a tightening of monetary policy and, simultaneously, an expansionary fiscal policy would be a very bad policy mix. And being more concrete, what would be detrimental is a fiscal deficit that goes above the level of 2022.   Does the ECB need to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system?   We are doing that. And this is totally normal in the process of normalisation of monetary policy. That is the correct pace, the correct path. TLTRO reached €2.1 trillion and now we are a little bit below €500 billion. And over the next year it will become close to zero.  What about stopping reinvestments in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme?  Some of my colleagues in the Governing Council have been quite outspoken with respect to the need for starting the process of quantitative tightening on the PEPP. But in the formal structure of the Council, we have not even started the discussion. It will arrive sooner or later.  Do you still need the flexibility of PEPP reinvestments as the first line of defence against financial market fragmentation, despite not having used it for two years?  If you ask the military, they will tell you that extra lines of defence are always good. Yes, we could use flexibility in the reimbursement of the PEPP to address fragmentation. It has not been used for two years because spreads are quiet. The PEPP is less than €2 trillion. Therefore, even doing a full run-off, the withdrawal of liquidity will not be huge. It is the first line of defence in times of volatility in markets, but that is not the case now. So, we’ll have to analyse it.  How about the banking system? Do you expect an increase in non-performing loans?  Return on European banks’ equity has clearly improved because of the widening of net interest margins after the increase in interest rates and it is now above 10%. Two years ago, it was around 4%. But banks’ valuations have not moved in parallel. Why? I think that the main reason is because the cost of equity of the European banks has increased quite a lot and it’s close to 15%. When interest rates increase, the cost of equity also goes up. Markets are also pricing in that the improvement in profitability will not be sustainable over time because they are factoring in an economic slowdown. And they price in that banks will have to increase provisions should non-performing loans levels go up.  This means profitability will be dented in the future. The current figures are a sort of illusion. In the pipeline, we start to see that the quality of the assets is deteriorating, and there’s an increase in non-performing loans. On top of that, taxes on bank profits have created some uncertainty.   Should countries not introduce bank taxes?   Not all bank taxes are identical. You have seen that in the case of Italy. The final proposal is much more sensible than the first one. Our point is very clear: these taxes should not impair credit and should not create any limitation in the capitalisation of European banks. This applies as well in terms of the banks being prudent in dividend payments and share buybacks, and even the remuneration of bankers.  Some members of the Governing Council would like to increase the minimum reserve requirements for the banks, on which you pay no interest. What do you think of that?  My opinion is that we should conduct monetary policy based on price stability, not on the profit and loss of national central banks. To reach price stability, you have to reduce liquidity. The reduction of liquidity will give rise to a reduction of these windfall profits that the commercial banks are getting at the moment because of increasing interest rates.   Are there any signs of distress in the property sector?   In commercial property there has been a very important decline in prices, mainly in some Nordic countries. The main problems have appeared in Sweden, Finland, the Nordic countries. But it’s quite pervasive. Residential real estate is more resilient. But, for instance, in the case of Germany, it was not a total surprise to see the recent data showing that house prices have declined by almost 10%. That’s a clear indication that there were some pockets of overvaluation that are going to be corrected. Our concern now are the non-banks, the property and mutual funds, that have a big exposure to real estate. I would say that commercial property – even though we also need to pay attention to residential property – is our main source of concern in terms of financial stability.   "
2023-09-27,Frank Elderson,Interview with Market News International ,"Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 22 September 2023 ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Market News International    Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 22 September 2023  27 September 2023  Your speech at   Terschelling   was something of a departure for a central banker, in that it was clearly very personal, while at the same time seeking to counter a certain pessimism regarding attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Are you concerned that there isn’t sufficient buy-in at the moment from, as you put it, “those who pollute, those who finance the polluters, and those who supervise the financiers of the polluters”?  Looking back at the past five years, there are many things that clearly show we are not transitioning to a zero-emission economy fast enough, with all the problems that brings economically. On the other hand, many other things are going in the right direction. My main message was that we can do this, but we need to be fast. The later the transition, the higher the cost, as our recent economy-wide climate stress test has shown. So I might have used a little more pathos than I would have done if speaking here in Frankfurt, but the message is just as clear.  Is the ECB doing enough?   As supervisors we have a multi-year strategy. We published our expectations for climate-related and environmental risks in 2020. In 2021 we asked the banks to conduct self-assessments of where they stood vis-à-vis these expectations. On the basis of what we saw a year ago, the glass is slowly filling up, but it is not yet half full and it needs to be full by the end of 2024. I do see progress – banks are now better equipped to manage climate-related and environmental risks than when we made our initial assessments. Each of our expectations has been met at least once by a bank we supervise. The glass is filling up – but it is not yet full. Building on what the banks themselves found reasonable, we set a series of interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year, the second at the end of 2023 and the last – by which banks need to satisfy all our expectations – at the end of 2024. And we have said that we will use all our instruments to enforce these deadlines if needed.  Banks understand that we mean what we say and that this is within our mandate, because climate-related and environmental risks translate into financial risks which must be managed by the banks. This is also acknowledged worldwide. Although you do still see differences in how fast and how ambitious supervisors are, the fact of these risks being within their mandate is no longer controversial. That is a real step forward, and one which also reflects the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example.  But in that speech and others you’ve highlighted the urgency that’s required. Is that compatible with what is arguably still a very gradualist approach aimed, essentially, at trying to bring banks along with you, rather than you saying “you absolutely have to do this now, and if you don’t there will be consequences”?  First of all, ask the bankers. I don’t think that they would say that this is extremely gradual – many banks probably feel that we are pursuing this rather enthusiastically. There are clear deadlines − also interim deadlines − and we will enforce them if necessary. To be very clear, that includes periodic penalty payments. That’s not a step we take lightly, so I think that this shows how serious we are when we issue supervisory expectations. Do I particularly like that? Well, I believe it’s better to convince the banks. I know we’re asking a lot, and some banks would say it’s very difficult and claim that they can’t really do anything because they lack the data. But it is also true that the risks don’t become smaller just because they are difficult to measure. There is still a lot you can do short of perfection. But the risks are out there, and they will not wait until 2030 or 2050 to materialise – so we need to make real progress. Patchy data are better than no data at all. The same is true of the emerging art of climate modelling. Patchy climate models are better than nothing, but if you don’t even identify the gaps, you cannot really make progress towards filling them. There are many other things banks can do besides climate modelling, and we have also published a guide of best practices for banks that sets out these numerous options.  So looking at it from other directions, is there anything more that the ECB could, or should, be doing beyond compliance, such as making green investment more attractive? Might we one day see the green TLTROs (targeted longer-term refinancing operations) that commentators were discussing not so long ago?  Whereas up to now we’ve been speaking about what we are doing in our banking supervision, you are now asking a question about what we might consider in our monetary policy. Talking about possible future instruments is of course highly speculative, because whenever we design an instrument, we take into consideration all the circumstances of that particular moment. Any instrument needs to be effective to pursue our primary mandate of price stability, and it needs to be proportionate. It also depends on the environment – whether we are in a period of policy tightening or accommodation. But climate considerations are clearly part of the monetary policy strategy we adopted in 2021. I think it’s fair to assume that we will take climate considerations into account in the features of any type of instrument we may design in future − including any purchase programme.  In your speech you also mentioned the extent to which national governments subsidise fossil fuel industries. Obviously, there are limits to the ECB’s mandate, and maybe this is pushing those limits. But insofar as this issue constitutes a financial stability risk, can the ECB play a greater role? Or should it be left to private citizens to pursue the issue through the courts?  You’re talking to a lawyer, and the overriding requirement through all of this is that we act within our mandate. And when I talk to banks, I point out that we are seeing exponential growth in climate-related litigation. From our perspective, banks need to manage that risk at a time when there are certain cases in which the courts have endorsed rather far-reaching legal theories, including against states. It can no longer be taken for granted that those judgments will not be repeated or set a precedent, and that is something banks should be acutely aware of.  You said recently that there will be a just transition or no transition. Could you unpack that a little?  What I wanted to say there is that, if you look at what is happening in the world, it is clear that there is a risk of a growing antagonism – that the energy transition and climate crisis become politicised. All EU Member States have committed to becoming Paris Agreement-aligned. Not delivering on that, or postponing the transition, will lead to an economically suboptimal situation where the transition ends up being more costly. Our own analysis has also shown this time and again. Bringing attention to this issue is within our mandate.  If we could turn to monetary policy – In your last Governing Council meeting, the ECB raised interest rates again. For the final time in the cycle?  We have said it very clearly: we consider that, with the decisions we’ve made and on the basis of our current assessment, the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term. Does that mean policy rates have peaked? Not necessarily. There is still a lot of uncertainty. That’s why we take these decisions meeting by meeting, on a data-dependent basis. Making any predictions about what we will do next would not be consistent with that approach.  How do you see the balance of risks to the inflation outlook? Is it simply that the latest hike puts the ECB on a sounder footing by guarding against any additional upward price pressures?  I think that’s exactly what it is. Of course, there are upward risks to inflation. There could, for example, be upward pressures on food and energy prices – since July we have been alluding in our monetary policy statement to the importance of weather and climate conditions in this respect. Climate change could also lead to a shift in longer-term inflation dynamics, but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation. Helpful distinctions have also been proposed by my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Isabel Schnabel, analysing the impact of climate change itself, the ongoing dependency on fossil fuels and the green transition. Some aspects are certainly inflationary – 2022’s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67% compared with the year before, for example, so that’s rather significant. But it could also be the case that, over much longer horizons and depending on how the transition goes, energy will become much more abundant and cheaper.  Do you see any evidence that the current interest rate environment is having a negative effect on green investment?  Any interest rate decision has an effect on investment, both green and non-green. In the end, I think the best we can do is make sure that we deliver on our price stability mandate. That will create the stable environment in which the transition – including the required investment, which needs to be sped up – can take place.  How concerned are you about the growth outlook for the euro area? Or does the primary mandate of price stability ultimately matter more?  What we’re seeing is a more protracted period of sluggish growth than we were expecting. Of course, we need to look at the various explanatory factors, such as lower demand for euro area exports, the impact of tighter financing conditions, lower residential and business investment, and the weakening services sector. On the other hand, labour markets are still strong and disposable income is expected to rise, which would have a stabilising effect on overall GDP growth. It’s also true that our primary mandate is to deliver price stability, and I think we have proven we are very determined to do that, as seen in the ten rate hikes that we’ve decided on since July 2022.  So would you consider cutting rates if growth were to surprise significantly to the downside in the coming months?  I think I’ve explained very clearly how we take our decisions. We take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and we look at all the incoming data. We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments, and we will weigh any incoming data carefully, as always, in relation to our inflation outlook.  Would you need to see inflation clearly and consistently trending below 2% over the course of your medium-term projections before considering a cut appropriate? Equally, would reinvestments need to have stopped by that time?  Let me stick to what I have just said. As you know, we stand ready to adjust all our instruments as needed. Based on today’s assessments, we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target. We will keep rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.   "
2023-09-22,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Yahoo Finance,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jennifer Schonberger ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Yahoo Finance   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jennifer Schonberger  22 September 2023  You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?  Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.  So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?  So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.  So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?  Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.  As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?  I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.  You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?  Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.  Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?  This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.   "
2023-09-05,Philip R. Lane,Interview with The Currency,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stephen Kinsella on 31 August 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with The Currency   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stephen Kinsella on 31 August 2023 5 September 2023  Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?  We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.  In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?  Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.  Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.  Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.  I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?  I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing. This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.  I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.  I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?  Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.  Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.  I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?  Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.  Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.  Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?  I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.  I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?  The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.  Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?  Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.  Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?  We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.  We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic!  For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?     "
2023-07-30,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Le Figaro ,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Anne Cheyvialle and Florentin Collomp on 28 July 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Figaro    Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Anne Cheyvialle and Florentin Collomp on 28 July 2023 30 July 2023  Within one year, you have increased interest rates to a record level. Are we reaching the end of this cycle?  We have covered a lot of ground and have made great progress in this fight against inflation. We are moving towards our goal. We will only know when we have reached this goal – a medium-term inflation target of 2% − by looking at the economic and financial data. And we will base our actions on our assessment of these data. I hear some people say that the final rate hike will take place in September. There could be a further hike of the policy rate or perhaps a pause. A pause, whenever it occurs, in September or later, would not necessarily be definitive. Inflation must return durably to its target. We are in an environment of uncertainty and will reassess the situation and our action on a meeting-by-meeting basis.     Will interest rates remain high for a long time or will they fall over the coming months?  The key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. We are committed to returning inflation to our target in a timely manner and for this we need a sufficiently restrictive policy in terms of level and length.  At a time when the economy is slowing down, wouldn’t further rate hikes make things worse?  Our aim is to lower inflation and our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the medium term. That necessarily involves a decline in activity. The ideal solution, which is known as a soft landing, is a moderate lowering of activity in tandem with a significant fall in inflation. The second-quarter GDP figures for France, Germany and Spain are quite encouraging. They support our scenario of GDP growth of 0.9% in the euro area this year.   How do you respond to criticisms of your monetary policy voiced by leaders such as Giorgia Meloni or Emmanuel Macron?  As a central banker you need to have a thick skin. And it’s essential to keep sight of the objective of lowering inflation and to be as clear as possible about the tools deployed and the intended results. I will appear before the European Parliament every quarter to report on what we have done.   Is inflation coming back under control?  Inflation is undoubtedly falling: we were at 10.6% in October 2022 and came back down to 5.5% in June. The decline is being driven particularly by the fall in energy price inflation. And monetary policy has clearly begun to have an impact on lowering inflation. You see that in the credit data, in both the interest rates – as our fellow citizens know – and in credit volumes, which are falling, as well as in firms’ demand for loans. We are also beginning to see it in the real economy: in the real estate sector and with regard to investment. We pay close attention to the inflation felt by our fellow citizens and also look very carefully at the mechanisms underlying inflation in order to analyse the root cause of the price increase. At present, the services sector (catering, IT, telecoms, transport...) is more resistant than the others to our monetary policy.   You have said that two-thirds of the inflation in 2022 was attributable to the rise in corporate profits: did firms take advantage of the situation?  What we see is that, unlike in previous crises, the shock was so massive, abrupt and widespread that it created conditions in which it was relatively easy to pass on costs to consumers. In other periods, owing to competition and a smaller gap between supply and demand, firms absorbed some of the costs and reduced their margins.  This time, the increases in wages, which represent a catch-up, and the rises in unit profits, are feeding inflation.   Are you afraid of a wage-price spiral?   We are following that very closely, because that would have a huge impact on the services sector. If you look at inflation expectations and the wage increases negotiated collectively and individually, there is no sign of a wage-price spiral emerging. But our projections expect firms to absorb part of the cost of the wage increases in their margins.  If wages don’t plug the loss of income caused by inflation, will households end up as the big losers of this inflationary shock?  In similar crises, wages have caught up with inflation, typically over a period of around three years. We can only hope that this is the case. I should add that through, for example, energy price caps, governments in most euro area countries have provided support not only to firms but also to households. Governments have covered some of the loss of income for households and firms.  Does this fiscal support hamper monetary policy?  As energy prices have been falling for a year, we believe that it is time to withdraw the at times quite broad-based support that has been granted and return to less expansionary fiscal policy. The euro area governments, including France, have made a start on this. And looking ahead, we need to return to a more sustainable level of public debt.  Is France, which has a high level of debt, doing enough to reduce its debt and deficit?  Like many euro area countries, France is aware of the need to restore a public spending policy that is consistent with debt sustainability.  What is your position on the ongoing reform of the euro area fiscal rules?   We have made recommendations to the European Commission in favour of simplified, more effective rules that are agreed among the Member States and effectively implemented. We can see the appeal of having rules tailored to each country’s situation as opposed to a single measure that applies in all circumstances. The proposed four-year debt-reduction path, which could be extended to seven years, is long for us. Also, we have suggested that a common fiscal capacity be created at the European level to handle spending for addressing shared challenges, such as war and climate change. It is a controversial proposal but we think it makes sense for a monetary union to also have elements of a fiscal union.  Is there a debt problem in the euro area? Could we find ourselves faced with situations similar to ten years ago?  If governments set out the rules and adhere to them, there is no reason for this kind of question to come up.   Is the risk of financial crisis fading?  Euro area banks have become much more resilient since the 2008 financial crisis. Capital ratios are significantly higher. Last week the ECB’s supervisory arm announced that it is going to ask banks to provide weekly updates on their liquidity ratios, and we are simply drawing lessons from what happened in the spring with Credit Suisse and some US institutions. These events led all supervisors and the whole financial community to reassess risk measures.  What are the major risks that could derail the economy?  The major risk is the geopolitical situation. Even in a stable situation, with sound economic policies, a political or geopolitical lapse creates volatility and can have an impact on markets. Any new shock – be it an oil or food price shock or an acceleration of the climate crisis – is a potential risk. I have often been criticised for bringing up climate risks, which I was told only exist in the long term. It makes me sad that reality is catching up with us, but this is the reality we see today. The drop in harvests, which is leading to higher prices for goods such as olive oil and rice, is leading some countries that are predominantly exporters, such as India, to take protectionist measures. Further ahead, the El Nino and Gulf Stream phenomena may have an impact on food prices.  Nicolas Sarkozy is said to have advised Emmanuel Macron to appoint you as Prime Minister: do you prefer Frankfurt to Paris?  I have a lot of work on my hands. I have got a job to do and I have a goal that I fully intend to achieve.   "
2023-07-07,Christine Lagarde,Interview with La Provence,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Geneviève Van Lède on 5 July 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with La Provence   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Geneviève Van Lède on 5 July 2023 7 July 2023  How would you rank the Rencontres économiques d`Aix-en-Provence on the international stage − as the Provence version of Davos?   I would describe it as an important meeting place for stimulating discussions on economic issues, similar to the forum on central banking hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal, every year for the last ten years, or its US equivalent in Jackson Hole. You mentioned Davos, but I think Davos is less exclusively focused on economic topics, which is hardly surprising given that this event in Aix-en-Provence is organised by the Cercle des économistes think tank.   What impact do the Rencontres have on the region?  You spoke of Davos to refer to the World Economic Forum. While the name of the Forum is well-known, it’s perhaps more often referred to by the name of the Swiss resort Davos. Locations are significant, just as Aix-en-Provence is for the Rencontres. I also think there’s a lasting bond between Aix-en-Provence and the Rencontres, offering an opportunity for the city and the region, as no-one can question the benefits it will bring to both, as indeed also to the Cercle des économistes, which has such a historic and inspiring setting for its proceedings. But I can imagine that it also presents quite a challenge as you have to live up to the success of the previous event every year anew.   You will be speaking this evening about the role of women. What are you going to tell the audience?   First and foremost that my priority is to maintain price stability. But that does not stop me from defending a cause that has been close to my heart for more than 40 years now. A cause which is in fact intricately linked to the economy – considering that it’s often women who decide on household purchases, even the biggest ones. On this all-woman panel, moderated by Emmanuelle Auriol, and including Laurence Boone and Louise Mushikiwabo, I will focus on the economic aspects, on women’s contribution to the economy. And why we should deplore the lack of progress on these issues and come up with solutions to remedy the situation.  How would you describe their contribution?  We can describe it in three ways. First, it lags behind when compared with the contribution made by men. Second, it is ignored. “Housework”, which is by and large done by women, is not factored into measures of wealth production, such as gross domestic product. Lastly, it is poorly paid. This is not just because women are still paid less than men [for doing the same job]. It is also because of the housework issue I just mentioned, and also because many women worldwide perform undeclared work.   How can we change this?  First, many countries have passed laws to fight discrimination and prevent gender pay gaps, but they are not being applied enough. Second, we need to develop the infrastructure or programmes that enable parents – not just women – to look after their children. France does comparatively well on this front. Third, we need to fundamentally change our ways. We need to stop thinking that only women can take care of having their children vaccinated or of making sure they do their homework. To take just one example [of such changes], society and employers should also encourage paternity leave.  Is inflation under control at last?  It has started to decline, falling from double-digits at the start of the autumn of 2022 to half that today, at 5.5% for the euro area as a whole in June. French figures are slightly weaker. This is due in particular to the fall in commodity and energy prices, and I think also to the initial impact of our monetary policy decisions on prices. Food prices are also rising at a slower pace. But inflation is still higher than our medium-term target of 2% and according to our staff projections, is set to remain so in 2024 and 2025. We therefore still have work to do to bring it back down and reach our target.  What about economic growth?  Growth has been flat in the last two quarters, with very slightly negative growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 (-0.1%) and zero growth in the first quarter of 2023. We estimate euro area growth to be around 0.9% in 2023, with the figure for France being very slightly lower, but we should see a return to potential growth over the period 2024-25.  Can firms increase wages as called for by their employees?  The recent period of high inflation was not accompanied by a reduction in firms’ profit margins, which even increased in some cases – particularly when demand for goods and services outstripped supply. At the same time, wages have also risen by more than expected. In the current context, it is important to know whether firms are going to reduce their margins a little to meet their employees’ expectations of higher wages and to restore some of their purchasing power, which is what has normally happened during previous high inflation episodes, or whether we are going to see a twofold increase – in margins and in wages. A simultaneous increase in both would fuel inflation risks, and we would not stand idly by in the face of such risks.  How can France reduce its debt?  All euro area countries saw their debt increase during the pandemic. Now that the health crisis is behind us and energy prices have fallen, a number of support programmes need to be withdrawn, such as the French energy tariff shield, and public finances need to be put on a path that will make it possible to reduce debt at a steady pace. And that is something that all countries can do.   "
2023-06-25,Luis de Guindos,Interview with ABC,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by María Jesús Pérez, John Müller and Daniel Caballero","  INTERVIEW  Interview with ABC   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by María Jesús Pérez, John Müller and Daniel Caballero 25 June 2023  The ECB’s greatest concern, its greatest challenge, is inflation. What can be done to overcome this crisis?  Last week we published our growth and inflation projections. Moderate growth is expected of below 1% this year and around 1.5% the next two years, with risks tilted to the downside. Monetary policy measures are starting to have an impact on financing conditions. The contraction in credit will pass through to the real economy. In turn, dampening demand will lower inflation. Our projections show that headline inflation in the euro area is clearly declining. We expect it to average 5.4% this year, 3% next year and to be slightly above 2% in 2025. However, underlying inflation (stripping out energy and food) is projected to reach more than 5% this year, mainly driven by unit labour costs. The labour market is robust and, although wage growth is in line with our projections, productivity is slowing, resulting in an increase in unit labour costs. This is essentially what explains our higher underlying inflation projection. In the medium term, headline and underlying inflation will no doubt decline, but we haven’t yet reached our price stability target.  Is that target still a long way off?  The latest series of interest rate hikes has been the steepest since the euro was introduced, and its effects are beginning to pass through to financing conditions, with a significant decline in the demand for credit affecting real economic activity. If this slows down, so will inflation. The finishing line is in sight.  Can we expect an end to interest rate hikes before the summer holidays?  That will depend on the data. So far, we have raised rates by 400 basis points and can already see the impact this is having, but we need to ensure that inflation converges and holds at around 2%, our price stability target. What happens with underlying inflation is paramount.  How can underlying inflation be tamed? It seems difficult to control.  The monetary policy measures we have already adopted will help, as will the base effects. Prices are not going to rise as sharply this year as they did last year in response to the shock triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is essential that we monitor second-round effects, rising wages and the behaviour of unit labour costs. If the situation deteriorates, monetary policy will have to act more forcefully. Fiscal policy must also play a part if we are to reduce inflation.  Spain always lagged behind the European Union when it came to inflation. And now the Spanish prime minister is boasting that we have one of the lowest rates in the euro area. Why is that?  Because of several factors related to energy, base effects and fiscal measures. But Spain’s underlying inflation is now in line with the euro area.  There are structural forces at play here.  One could even say that Spain provides a leading indicator for future inflation in the euro area. Inflation in Spain initially rose at a faster pace than in the euro area, but has subsequently slowed more sharply, whereas underlying inflation has proved to be much stickier than the euro area average.  Are these asymmetries between European countries easy to identify from your position at the ECB?  There have always been differences, but they are arguably more marked now. Proximity to war has a lot to do with this. Inflation is higher in the Baltic states. The current inflation scenario cannot be understood without taking into account the wave of shocks that have hit Europe: the pandemic, the reopening of the economy and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Without the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies of 2020 and 2021, the fall in GDP would have been far more pronounced. In such exceptional circumstances, we must adhere to the lesser evil principle. There is no one perfect measure to cover every economic parameter, so one has to choose the least harmful.  Is the lesser evil now a possible recession in the euro area?  The priority now is to bring down inflation, because of its very negative impact on social well-being. Inflation is an economic evil. Fighting it must be our goal.  Does inflation come before growth?  It is very difficult for economic growth and stability to co-exist with high inflation. The possibility of combining high inflation with high growth vanished with the series of supply shocks that we have seen. If we are to resume strong growth, inflation must come down.  The European Commission has asked Member States to roll back the support measures they adopted in response to the energy crisis. Is this a way to stop fuelling inflation?  Energy prices are lower than they were when the war started. The support measures adopted to shield the most vulnerable sectors made sense at the time, but they now need to be gradually rolled back. This will help correct the public deficit. Countervailing fiscal and monetary policies, i.e. one that is expansionary, the other restrictive, should be avoided. If that were the case, inflation would not drop as expected and a stronger monetary policy response would be called for. Instead of having the finishing line in sight, a tighter monetary policy stance would be needed.  Some European countries are concerned about their deficit, which you have just mentioned. You stated that it would be reduced, before or after the pandemic, and that countries with higher deficits and debt levels would have to implement adjustment programmes. Do you still see that as feasible?  The gradual return to some degree of fiscal discipline that ensures the long-term sustainability of public finances is currently a subject of debate across the EU. We cannot continue with the fiscal policy of the last four years. That is true for all Member States, particularly those that are more vulnerable from a fiscal standpoint.  Some economists in Spain say that the Spanish economy has been stagnating since 2006-2007. According to the Banco de España, we are no longer converging with other European economies. Should we be concerned?  Two factors explain the divergence of Spain’s per capita income with respect to the euro area average: the severity of the 2008-2013 crisis and the pandemic. Spain has practically returned to pre-pandemic income levels, but this is not yet the case for per capita income. Some recovery was seen from 2013 to 2019 and I hope that convergence with the euro area will continue in terms of per capita income. For this to happen, we must ensure fiscal sustainability. The Spanish financial sector is not giving any cause for concern and the country has posted a current account surplus for the last ten years. However, there is room for improvement. Spain needs a fiscal sustainability plan, it must ensure domestic market unity, address the aspects of the labour market that are not working and undertake educational reform to address the supply-demand imbalance. All these reforms are structural and require political consensus and government policies. Many can only be achieved if there is agreement between the main political parties.  Are you optimistic an agreement will be reached?  The funds made available through the Next Generation EU programme provide us with a great opportunity to invest in digitalisation and the green transition. However, bringing about a reduction in the deficit will require changes to how autonomous regions and local governments are funded, as well as tax reform. It will be very difficult to achieve this without an agreement between the main political parties.  Would you agree that we are lagging seriously behind when it comes to implementing structural reforms?  That is clearly the reason behind the Spanish economy’s sluggish recovery.  From your position at the ECB in Frankfurt, you can clearly see all of these differences and disparities in growth. Do you feel that a European fiscal union is what is missing?  I have always been in favour of more centralised fiscal policy. Having a more centralised fiscal policy, a common budgetary instrument, makes even more sense when there is a crisis.   There are also differences in the euro’s depreciation, for example, between Spain and Germany. Will we be hearing about the risk premium again?  The risk premium is primarily linked to fiscal policy. As far as the financial market turmoil in March is concerned, all indicators of this turmoil have recovered or improved since then. What’s more, two banks recently issued Additional Tier 1 bonds. European banks have higher levels of capital and more liquidity. But they shouldn’t get too ahead of themselves. Even though they have coped better than banks in other countries, this doesn’t mean that everything is done and dusted. Banks will see a reduction in their revenues. Loans will see weaker growth, their cost of carry will increase and banks will have to start paying higher interest on deposits. And all of this will occur as the economy slows. Last year the euro area grew by 3.5%, but the projection for this year is 0.9%. In addition, rising interest rates may result in an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs). Banks are benefiting from the increase in their net interest income following the rise in interest rates, but they have to look beyond this initial effect and not get carried away just yet.  Does the ECB feel confident about the euro area banking sector at present?  We will publish the results of our stress test results in July, which will provide us with a more detailed picture. The European banking sector has so far coped well with the impact of the problems certain medium-sized US banks and Credit Suisse encountered. However, our recently published Financial Stability Review highlighted some risks and vulnerabilities, including the drop in loans and the potential increase in default rates.  Would you go so far as to say the next crisis won’t be financial in nature?  In the euro area, there is currently very moderate growth, a services sector that is outperforming the manufacturing sector, a robust labour market, tighter financing conditions and a more solid banking system than ten years ago. Financial crises always start in the real economy owing to excessive indebtedness. This is not the situation at present. European households currently have relatively reasonable levels of debt, as do firms in general. But fiscal imbalances have grown. And with interest rates rising, vulnerabilities that built up during the period of low interest rates could bubble to the surface. That’s why we must be vigilant.  But there does seem to be a crisis of confidence in financial institutions.  There has been a reputational crisis, but not so much a crisis of confidence as I see it. On average, banks’ share prices have improved, for example, over the last few months.  To keep this spectre of mistrust at bay, would it be a good idea to create a common deposit insurance scheme?  Absolutely.  Not having this kind of scheme is the European banking system’s biggest vulnerability. It hasn’t been created yet because there are different ways of looking at it.  Such as Germany’s?  I don’t want to mention specific countries’ positions. I would just like to stress that the lack of a European deposit insurance scheme could have negative consequences for the entire financial system.  The banking sector is in a better position than it was ten years ago, but in some countries, deposits don’t receive any interest.    When interest rates rise, they should rise across the board, on the assets and the liabilities side. There is always greater resistance towards raising them on the liabilities side. But this has to happen sooner or later. Rate increases should be reflected across the board.  In Spain, some people say there is tacit collusion among banks to not pay interest on deposits, and that there is a lack of competition owing to an excessive degree of concentration.  Competition has as much to do with the number of competitors as it does with their solvency. But the question of whether or not there is collusion is one for the competition authorities, not the ECB. There is currently still excess liquidity in the market, which means there is not as much need for banks to compete to attract deposits. But this excess liquidity is being withdrawn, which will result in banks having to start competing with each other.  Margarita Delgado, Deputy Governor of Banco de España, is among the front runners to become Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB. Would you support her appointment?    Margarita Delgado is a consummate professional and has always had my support, both in her present role as Deputy Governor and previously, when she was a Deputy Director General at the ECB.  Do you have anything to say about Rodrigo Rato’s book?  I don’t get involved in discussions of this kind, and I wish him the very best. The bailout of the [Spanish] banking sector was conducted in a completely transparent way, and the Spanish financial system is in good shape today.   "
2023-06-08,Frank Elderson,Interview with the Financial Times,"Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 1 June 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with the Financial Times   Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 1 June 2023 8 June 2023  Why is the ECB concerned about the risks of biodiversity loss?  To pursue price stability, we need to understand the economy. We need to understand how economic trends and shocks affect the effectiveness of our monetary policy transmission. This is nothing new. We look at trends like demographics, globalisation, innovation and digitalisation. We’ve always done this and now we understand that climate change and crucially also biodiversity belong in that list of things that affect the economy. In my view, if we did not take climate, environment, biodiversity and nature-related aspects into account, we would be failing to deliver on our mandate.   Is there a particular reason to be looking at this now?  We should avoid doing too little, too late. With climate, we now understand that higher temperatures can lead to higher prices, ultimately feeding into higher inflation. But the same is likely true for biodiversity. Take farmers – they need pollination. Without pollination, there are lower crop yields, and possibly higher prices. Farmers need healthy soils. Without healthy soils, it’s the same thing; there will be lower crop yields, which may have an impact on prices and inflation.  Now all this happens against the backdrop of a trend that is worrisome. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services states clearly that in terms of nature and biodiversity, we are on a downward trend. To give you some examples: of the species they assessed, 25% of the animal and plant groups are threatened. This means that 1 million species face a risk of extinction, many of those within decades; 85% of wetlands have already been lost; 66% of the oceanic area is experiencing cumulative impacts; and 75% of the land surface is significantly altered.  Look at the River Po in Italy. Just a month ago it was already at a level where it would normally be in August. In August last year, it was empty. You could walk to the other side. This matters a lot if you depend on it. The economy relies on nature. Destroy nature, and you destroy the economy. Analytically, we can use the widely accepted framework that we have for climate-related risks: we can look at physical risks and transition risks facing the economy that are related to biodiversity loss.   Give me an example of a physical risk in biodiversity.  The agricultural sector’s dependence on pollination by insects is an example of a physical risk. We see insect populations dwindling and this will negatively affect crop yields. Another example is that large parts of the tourism sector rely on the beauty and diversity of nature to attract tourists as customers. If the forest they want to visit is burnt down or logged, they may no longer visit that area. These physical risks affect supply and therefore they could also affect prices. And this is where it could get into the realm of monetary policy, of price stability and of inflation. But also think of the firms that are active in these sectors. The farm producers, the tourism companies but also the construction companies that rely on timber or sand. They will potentially suffer from a diminishing or a degradation of the nature-related services they rely on, which might hamper or negatively impact their profitability. Protection against flooding provided by mangrove forests is another example. And there are many more. The economy relies on the services of nature. This is also why we have to dig deeper.   But we’re not going to run out of trees or sand, are we?  They become scarcer and then prices might go up. These things are happening. In the Netherlands, there is a huge nitrogen problem. This is not climate-related at all, but it is something that affects production. This will hamper profitability. And that might have an impact on banks, which of course have exposures to these firms, and this might affect credit risk.  What about transition risk, how does that work?  Governments are not sitting on their hands; they are taking actions against biodiversity loss. We already have the Montreal Convention on Biological Diversity, which might increase existing natural reserves. There is a transition risk if your firm’s activities take place on the land that is adjacent to existing reserves that are going to be expanded. Think about nitrogen. There are already limits on how much nitrogen deposits are being allowed. This directly affects production by the farmers involved. Another example is if governments want to do something to prevent the loss of insect populations. One day there will be legislation on pesticides. That is a transition risk. If you are the pesticide manufacturer, maybe your product is going to be phased out or prohibited.  Transition risk can also be caused by changing consumer preferences. Consumers could start saying “I don’t want to buy products from firms that are known to be actively involved in deforestation” or “I don’t want to buy products or services from firms that have not signed up to certain voluntary associations or protocols”. This risk can materialise suddenly. The same might happen with investors, because a number of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment policies extend beyond climate.  All of this can also affect the banks that lend to the companies affected, because those firms might no longer be able to service their debt. I’m not predicting the extent to which this will happen, but it is how causal chains can play out. This is why we are analysing these exposures and why we will be publishing a report on them in the autumn.  What will be in this report you plan to publish on biodiversity loss?  We looked at 4.2 million euro area firms to determine their exposure to nature-related services. What we found is that 72% of firms – about 3 million firms – depend on at least one of these nature-related services, sometimes more. So the things we talked about earlier: timber, clean water, pollination, sand, healthy soils. That’s quite a lot. And we looked at more than just these firms. We also looked at bank loans. We found that 75% of bank loans are to firms that depend on ecosystem services. So banks are clearly exposed. It is a landmark analysis because it’s the first time that someone has looked at the exposure to biodiversity loss in the financial system of the euro area as a whole.   What else have you found?  Now the research that we are doing goes further than that because just looking at who is exposed doesn’t give you all the answers yet. You also want to see what the sensitivity to shocks is. You need to go one step further and ask what happens if there are certain degradations in some of these nature-related services. How will that affect the firms that depend on them, and how will that dependence then affect the exposures that the banks have? It’s a little early to say much more. We will be very happy to explain in more detail when we publish the full report. It will be more granular and deeper. We will also assess transition risk aspects by looking at how firms’ activities have an impact on biodiversity. This angle serves as a kind of proxy for what might happen to these firms if regulation of the kind I mentioned before is introduced.  What about banking supervision?  When we published our guide on climate-related and environmental risks at the end of 2020, that broader scope was new because so far most other supervisory authorities had just focused on climate. After that, we asked banks to provide their self-assessments in 2021 and to come up with action plans. Then in 2022, we conducted what we call a thematic review, in which we looked at all the banks under our direct supervision. One of the findings was that banks have made less progress on environmental risks than on climate-related risks. While 25% of the banks had not yet conducted a materiality assessment of climate risks, 40% hadn’t yet done so for environmental issues. So the glass is not yet half full.   Have you seen signs of progress since then?  There is progress now on biodiversity. Very concretely, we have seen the first banks that actually, in their internal capital calculations, earmark capital for environmental risks. That is an interesting development. But we want full compliance by all banks with all our expectations. We try to help the banks by publishing examples of good practices. At the same time, I’ve been making it very clear that, if needed, we will also enforce them. It’s carrots and sticks.  What’s your objective here? Are you trying to save the planet and the natural world? Or are you just focused on the financial and economic risks?   Let me try to be super specific here. Even if I couldn’t care less about the planet, even if I couldn’t care less about biodiversity, I would say the exact same things. The fact that as a private citizen I may have certain concerns is not relevant for anything that I say here. What I’m trying to explain is that this is a risk that banks need to manage. What I’m saying is that biodiversity and nature-related services generally are relevant for the economy. This is not some kind of a flower power, tree-hugging exercise. This is core economics. This is core financial stability, core macroprudential, core price stability. It would be nice if we had more data, if we had more certainty, more clarity. But sometimes you have to deal with the knowledge that you have. On the basis of the knowledge we have, we certainly see that there are more pages in this chapter. But it’s not about saving the planet. It’s about our mandate. It’s about safeguarding price stability. It’s about financial stability. It’s about a resilient banking system.   But how do you measure this? With climate change, you look at carbon emissions. What is the yardstick for biodiversity?  There are similarities between climate and biodiversity that make both difficult. What they have in common is uncertainty, and the non-linearity of these risks. You cannot just extrapolate from what you’re seeing today. There might be tipping points and these might lead to irreversible effects, in which case there’s no going back, even if we change our ways of living. And there’s all this uncertainty on the likelihood of certain things happening and the timing of it all, and the magnitude. But it’s true what you say, there’s not just one easy carbon dioxide-kind of measurement for biodiversity. But things are happening. We have the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which contains disclosure requirements that go beyond climate. They also cover biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as water and marine resources and pollution.   Could we see more concrete action to address these risks by the ECB, not just on banking supervision, but also in your asset portfolio or collateral rules?  When we published our measures to include climate change in our monetary policy operations in July last year, the statement had a review clause stating that the ECB Governing Council stands ready to revisit all of its climate-related policies if more is needed, with a specific reference to also look at environmental issues. I’m not predicting anything specific here. Our actions will follow where the science, analysis and research take us.   The ECB looks like a bit of an outlier here, doesn’t it? Why aren’t other big central banks doing this too?  We are not the only ones. Before us, similar work was done by De Nederlandsche Bank and then by the Banque de France, but also by Malaysia, Brazil, Singapore and the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which has 125 members who all signed up to its statement that “nature-related risks, including those associated with biodiversity loss, could have significant macroeconomic implications, and that failure to account for, mitigate, and adapt to these implications is a source of risks relevant for financial stability”. I think this worldwide recognition of the significance of nature-related risks is important. You say we are somewhat of an outlier. Well, maybe some people speak up more openly. When I believe in something, I say it. But I am not the only one. The NGFS statement is a strong one. That all flows from work that has been done together with many others, including the US Federal Reserve. Look at the Basel Committee, where I co-chair a task force on climate-related risks. There, the scope is climate-related risk. But everything I’ve said in terms of the analytical framework distinguishing transition risks and physical risks, it’s all in there. And this analytical framework is subscribed to by the entire Basel Committee.    "
2023-06-07,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with De Tijd,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Wouter Vervenne and Kris van Hamme on 31 May 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with De Tijd   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Wouter Vervenne and Kris van Hamme on 31 May 2023 7 June 2023  Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.    People are fed up with inflation. What hope can you offer them? When will inflation return to 2%?  Headline inflation in the euro area has come down relatively quickly after hitting a peak of 10.6% in October of last year. However, underlying inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices, Ed.) is more persistent and remains high, with services playing a key role due to the relatively strong impact of wage costs on inflation in these sectors. Rising food prices are also driving inflation, but we expect food inflation to fall in view of the global slowdown in agricultural commodity prices. According to our March projections, inflation will return to our 2% target only in 2025. This would mean above-target inflation for around four years – a very long time. One important question is how this may affect inflation expectations of businesses and households, and hence firms’ price setting and wage negotiations. Wage agreements can have a prolonged effect on inflation due to their long duration. That’s why it is so important to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored at our target and bring inflation back to 2 percent as quickly as possible.   You have said that food prices are still quite high. And that is the case while the United Nations’ Food Price Index peaked one year ago. What’s going on?   It is a bit comparable with energy prices. There, we have seen a surprisingly fast pass-through of rising wholesale prices to consumer prices, followed by a more gradual pass-through on the way down. We may see a similar development in food prices. This shows how difficult it is to forecast how price changes will be passed on to consumers. In the longer term, we may be facing recurring periods of strong food price increases due to climate change, which leads to more frequent droughts, extreme weather events and failed harvests. We are therefore monitoring the evolution of food prices carefully. This is also a sensitive social issue.  Another sensitive issue is “greedflation”, where businesses take advantage of the inflationary environment to increase their profit margins, thereby stoking inflation. You have since recognised that the ECB has paid too little attention to corporate profits. Did this surprise you?  If one looks at the drivers of domestic inflation, both wages and corporate profits have recently played an important role. Many companies were not only able to fully pass on their higher input costs to customers, but they even increased their profit margins. This was to a large extent owed to the specific pandemic situation, when after the reopening of the economy strong demand outpaced constrained supply in a number of sectors. This gave firms higher pricing power. This can lead to what I call a profit-wage-price spiral, as opposed to a simple wage-price spiral (whereby rising wages and prices chase each other higher, Ed.). First, many firms raised their prices over and above their cost increases. Trade unions are now trying to negotiate higher wages, facilitated by the tight labour market and higher corporate profits. In the case of Belgium, there is even automatic wage indexation. The question then is how businesses will respond. Will they continue to fully pass on higher costs, or even more than that, or will they partially absorb them through lower profit margins? That will largely depend on how strong the demand for goods and services remains. That is where the central bank has a key role to play. Our monetary policy works by dampening growth in aggregate demand (through higher interest rates, Ed.), which makes it harder for firms to pass on costs and reduces workers’ bargaining power to push through higher wage demands.  Is the policy tool of higher interest rates not a rather blunt instrument to hammer down inflation caused by rising profit margins?  It is ultimately a distributional question how to share the burden of higher energy costs between labour and capital, and this question is up to the social partners and governments. It is not up to central banks to decide this. We must use the tools we have.  The ECB was one of the last central banks to start raising rates to tackle inflation. Was it not too late?  The tightening process already began well before the first rate hike in July 2022. In December 2021 we announced ending some of our asset purchases. Hence, rates in financial markets increased much earlier than July 2022. Moreover, monetary policy needs to respond to the economic situation, which is not the same everywhere. That’s why the ECB started hiking later than the US Federal Reserve. With hindsight, one could say that we should have acted earlier. But in 2021, we were still in the middle of the pandemic. We were faced with the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and a great deal of uncertainty. The Russian invasion of Ukraine stoked inflation further. It is difficult to say how inflation would have evolved without the war.  Over the last year the ECB has raised interest rates at a rapid pace. When can we expect to see a pause in the hikes?  Our interest rate decisions are data-dependent and are based on three elements: the inflation outlook, the evolution of underlying inflation and the transmission of our monetary policy to the economy. The latter occurs in three stages: A rise in the policy rate first has an impact on financing conditions, then on the real economy, and ultimately on wages and prices. Staff analysis suggests that monetary policy transmission is proceeding and that the impact of our tighter monetary policy on inflation is expected to peak in 2024. However, there is great uncertainty over the strength and the speed of this process. The estimated impact varies greatly depending on the models used and, in particular, on the role expectations play in consumption and investment decisions. The less important the role of expectations, the weaker is generally the transmission of monetary policy. Moreover, given the current shortage of workers, one could expect monetary policy transmission to be weaker than usual. Finally, loan contracts with fixed-term rates over long periods have become more prevalent. As a result, it may take longer than was previously the case to see the impact of our policy. To deal with this uncertainty, we try to balance the risks of doing too little against the risks of doing too much. Given the high uncertainty about the persistence of inflation, the costs of doing too little continue to be greater than the costs of doing too much. The reason is that once inflation has become entrenched in the economy, it becomes much more costly to fight it. We have more ground to cover. It will depend on the incoming data by how much more rates will have to increase.  Markets are expecting two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each. Is that realistic?  That will depend on the incoming data. Let me be very clear: A peak in underlying inflation would not be sufficient to declare victory: we need to see convincing evidence that inflation returns to our 2% target in a sustained and timely manner. We are not at that point yet.   In some euro countries, including Belgium, banks are being criticised because their deposit rate is much lower than the ECB rate. President Lagarde recently said that she supported the call by the Dutch finance minister to increase the interest rate on savings. Do you agree with that?   The pass-through of the ECB’s interest rate increases to bank lending rates was very quick, while the pass-through to deposit rates is much slower. But there are differences across different types of deposits. Deposit rates for corporates and time deposits reacted more strongly. Much depends on how customers react. If depositors start to shift their money from overnight deposits to higher-yielding alternatives at other banks or in financial markets, banks will likely respond by increasing interest rates to retain deposits. If customers prefer to leave their savings in overnight deposits because they like having liquidity and ease of payment, it is not surprising that banks are not adjusting their interest rates.  As President Lagarde has said, this matters for monetary policy transmission, which works not only through lending rates but also through deposit rates. Higher deposit rates provide an incentive to save more (and thus slow down consumption, Ed.). From a monetary policy transmission perspective, it’s desirable that the increases in the ECB rates are passed through to deposit rates. But we cannot make the banks offer higher rates, this is a business decision.   The drawback is that higher interest rates on deposits erode bank profitability, as the sector itself warns. Do you see a danger for financial stability?  Bank profitability has recently increased significantly, although I agree that higher rates on deposits and other bank funding will have a dampening impact over time. But banks have to manage their interest rate risk themselves. We have recently seen striking examples of banks in the United States that failed to manage that risk properly, even though it’s one of the most fundamental risks in banking.  The situation in the euro area appears to be better, thanks to banks‘ high capital and liquidity ratios. But there is no room for complacency. The rise in interest rates has changed the macroeconomic environment fundamentally and exposed the fragilities in the financial system that built up over the period of very low interest rates. The Financial Stability Review published last week highlights those risks. Some asset prices, including real estate, may come under pressure. Higher indebtedness of households, firms and sovereigns tends to increase the vulnerability to higher interest rates. And banks and non-bank financial institutions face liquidity and interest rate risks.  Aren’t the central banks responsible? Leading economist Raghuram Rajan recently stated that extremely loose monetary policy had made the financial system vulnerable by encouraging speculation. Would you agree?   Central banks always have to look at the side effects of their monetary policy actions, including the risks for financial stability. One of the objectives of our bond purchases was to incentivise higher risk-taking in the economy. We need to analyse in more detail how that has affected financial stability risks over time and, in future, we may need to better balance the benefits against the side effects. It’s clear that the fragilities are partly related to a long period of low interest rates, which however was not only due to monetary policy but also to structural factors.  In the past, tightening monetary policy after a long period of cheap money has often triggered a banking crisis. Do you think further mishaps can be avoided?   The banking sector is robust, and the economy has so far proven resilient, even though there are some signs of slowing growth. The euro area economy is subject to countervailing forces. On the one hand, it is benefiting from falling energy prices, fading supply bottlenecks and still expansionary fiscal policy. On the other hand, tighter monetary policy has a dampening effect. There is a striking divergence between the weak manufacturing sector and the strong services sector – a global phenomenon . At present we do not expect a recession in the euro area. Negative growth in Germany in the first quarter of 2023 was mainly driven by a marked decline in government spending. The labour market remains strong and unemployment is at historical lows.  Our March projections pointed to a soft landing of the economy. But we cannot be sure that it will really work out that way.   You mentioned fiscal policy, which has been very accommodating since the pandemic. Doesn‘t that hamper your fight against inflation?   Fiscal policy in the euro area as a whole is still expansionary and this fuels inflationary pressures. Monetary policy then needs to be more forceful to counteract that. We have been stressing for some time now that governments should focus on expanding the supply capacity of the economy in order to boost productivity (through education, infrastructure, the labour market, Ed.). That would help dampen inflation. But that is not what is happening in most countries.   Speaking of forceful policy: are there still any hawks at the ECB? German central bankers like yourself are typically thought to support a rigid and strict policy, whereas you are known as a pragmatic central banker who looks at the data and is not afraid to change her mind.   We all look at the incoming data to take the right decisions. But the data can be interpreted in different ways, which is why we have extensive discussions. Our objective is to take balanced decisions that are not based on ideology.   Can you give an example of such an extensive discussion within the Governing Council?   We had a thorough discussion on the pass-through of energy price changes to the economy. We saw a very fast pass-through of rising energy prices to consumer prices. The question was how quickly this would be reversed when energy prices were coming down and whether one could expect a full reversal or whether the reaction would be asymmetric. To this end, we looked at the empirical evidence on previous episodes in order to have a rational debate.  What about the ECB’s own inflation models, which have failed to forecast inflation for years now? How is the drive to improve these models going?   Our inflation target is defined over the medium term, so we must be forward-looking. Therefore,  models are an indispensable part of our toolkit. But we must acknowledge that they have not always performed very well in the past few years. I draw two conclusions from that: first, we have to be aware of our models’ limitations; second, we have to try to improve them as much as possible.  Starting with the limitations: we need to be more transparent about the uncertainties surrounding our projections. These might stem, for example, from changes in historical patterns or from different models predicting different outcomes. Moreover, the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations is often not captured by the models. Finally, we need to communicate more clearly that no model can predict exogenous shocks, such as a pandemic or a war. To improve the models we need to analyse the causes of our projection errors and look at whether we can modify the models accordingly. That is an ongoing process.  Will greater transparency about the uncertainty of your projections not undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy?   I don’t think so. By stressing the point estimates of our forecasts we give the illusion of a degree of precision that we can never reach. Rather than constantly explaining the inaccuracy of the projections, it would be better for our credibility if we published them with confidence bands. Transparency will strengthen our credibility, although I don’t deny that it is a challenge to communicate clearly on this topic.  One other option, which we used during the pandemic, is to present different scenarios. That can be very useful during exceptional situations.   How do you see inflation evolving in the longer term? Will structural forces such as deglobalisation and climate change push us towards a world with higher inflation?  Our projection models typically don’t capture structural trends in the economy; we analyse those trends through a separate exercise, which then partly feeds into the models. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have clearly led to structural changes, one of the biggest being geopolitical shifts, which may imply a decline in globalisation. This may partly reverse the process that we have seen when China entered the world market, which raised global supply and competition, and gave western firms the opportunity to offshore activities (and profit from China’s lower wage costs, Ed.), thereby creating downward pressure on inflation. We may now see the opposite development.  A second major structural change is the green transition. I expect that this will lead to higher inflationary pressures through three channels. The first is the greater frequency of natural disasters, which I call “climateflation”. The second is higher prices of fossil fuels – “fossilflation” – during the transition phase, caused by taxes on carbon emissions and lower investments in the fossil fuel sector. Finally, the shift towards renewable energies leads to higher demand for certain metals and minerals, which I call “greenflation”.  There are other trends, too, such as the demographic change. The effect that this will have on inflation is still subject to a lively debate. We’ve seen in the past decade that ageing societies have tended to save more and spend less, which dampens inflation. The question is whether the elderly, or their heirs, will spend these savings now. Changes in the labour market could also have a significant impact on inflation, with a decline in people of working age pushing up wages, unless countered by higher immigration.  On top of that we have new technological developments such as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Past experience shows that such developments typically dampen inflation by raising productivity.  Considering all of those structural forces together, I would tend to see structurally higher inflation pressures in future.   What does this mean for monetary policy? Will it need to be adjusted – including the inflation target – to deal with this new reality and avoid misaligned policy?    Supply side shocks have a strong impact on monetary policy. Often, we cannot simply look through such shocks, but we need to deal with them in line with our mandate of price stability. We are not even thinking about thinking to change our inflation target.   "
2023-06-02,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Le Monde,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Monde   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert 2 June 2023  The ECB’s objective is to keep inflation at 2%. It is currently at 6.1%. Should people be worried?  There is no doubt that 6.1% is too high, but people should not be worried. We will bring inflation back to 2%. In less than a year, we have raised interest rates decisively, from -0.5% to 3.25%, and inflation is falling, as confirmed by yesterday’s data.  As a result of our rate hikes, banks are increasing lending rates and reducing the loan supply. This is being passed on to the real economy: firms are taking this into account when they plan their future investments, as are households when they take out home loans. But monetary policy typically exerts its impact over extended periods. It takes several quarters before its effects are fully felt by the real economy and then transmitted to inflation.   But how long will it take before inflation returns to a reasonable level, like 3%, for example?  Our March projections suggest that inflation should hover around 3% early next year and approach 2% in 2025. However, this scenario does not account for any potential, unforeseen shocks.  Since the autumn of 2021, the ECB has been saying that inflation will soon return to 2%. Why should Europeans believe you now?   Investors understand that inflation has risen because of a series of adverse global shocks that are beyond the control of monetary policy. They know that we will intervene until we see inflation heading convincingly towards our 2% target and they expect it to return to that level. So far we haven't succeeded, but not because of the reasons suggested by commentators in 2021 who predicted a sharp rise in inflation. Nobody had foreseen the severity of the supply chain bottlenecks, the war in Ukraine or Russia’s manipulation of energy supplies. Without these unpredictable events, the economic landscape would be quite different, with significantly lower inflation.  Does inflation only reflect the war and the pandemic? In 2020-21, euro area governments had built up a very high deficit. This massive stimulus was only possible because the ECB made huge debt purchases. In hindsight, was this a mistake? Did you loosen monetary policy too much?  We are too quick to forget that the combined intervention of the ECB and governments following the pandemic saved the euro area from an economic depression. In 2020 the euro area economy contracted by 6%. Imagine the potential fallout had we not acted decisively: the risk of falling into a prolonged recession and of deflation, which could have led to an economic depression, was real. The subsequent economic recovery has contained the deficit and debt as a percentage of GDP. Inflation was largely caused by bottlenecks and the war, not monetary policy.  We are now addressing the inflationary consequences of these shocks, and our actions should be measured against our success in curbing inflation. In this respect, as proven in the past, we are fully determined to reach our 2% target.  Is inflation still fuelled by supply shocks? Inflation in the services sector is high – it was 5.0% in May – and core inflation (stripping out energy and food prices) is at 5.3%, which is more likely to be demand-driven.  I don’t think strong domestic demand is our main problem. In the last quarter of 2022 the euro area recorded a fall in consumption and investment. It is mainly foreign demand that is underpinning growth. The main threat to price stability derives from the strength of the labour market and firms’ profit strategies, although so far there are no clear indications of a self-sustained wage-price spiral.  Core inflation does not accurately represent the typical consumption basket, especially for low-income consumers. More importantly, as I have said in the past, it is not a good leading indicator for future headline inflation. Core inflation usually lags behind headline inflation. And just as it has lagged behind energy inflation on the way up, it is now proving to be persistent even after energy inflation has gone down. But we can expect it to come down eventually too. In this respect, yesterday’s figures are encouraging.  Growth in the euro area was just 0.1% in the first quarter. Isn’t there a risk that rising interest rates will stifle what little growth there is?   Our rate increases aim to prevent inflation from taking root for too long. The good news is that the European economy hasn’t plunged into the deep recession that some had predicted, thanks to more rapid-than-expected drops in energy prices and to fiscal support. But our monetary tightening will be felt in the coming months. We cannot rule out the possibility that domestic demand will continue to be weak and that this will translate into a prolonged weakness in economic activity or even a technical recession.  So, how high should you continue to raise interest rates?   Given the extraordinary level of economic uncertainty, estimating the terminal rate is challenging. Our decisions are currently guided by developments in economic data, which we assess on a meeting-by-meeting basis. I don’t think this is the time to be too hasty in raising rates, given the considerable ground we have already covered. My intuition suggests that we have not reached the end of our rate-hike cycle, though we’re not far away from it. I think the policy debate will soon shift away from “how high?” to “how long?”. There is substantial scope for fighting inflation by keeping rates high for as long as necessary. We should be resolute yet judicious, with the aim of lowering inflation without unnecessarily harming economic activity.  Has Europe suffered a permanent loss of competitiveness as a result of the war? It no longer has access to Russian gas. At the same time the United States is paying very high subsidies through the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Chinese are doing the same.  The European growth model of the last 20-30 years is running out of steam. This model, based on cheap energy and offshoring – particularly to China – focused largely on exports, compressing domestic demand, especially in large economies. But export-led growth is not a natural fit for a large economy such as the euro area and it exposes us to excessive fragility, especially during phases of geopolitical tension, like the current one. The euro area is in a position to determine its own economic destiny.  We need to revisit our growth model, adapting it to the new geopolitical landscape. The European summit in Versailles in March 2022 marked a significant milestone, as Europe recognised the need to invest in common public goods in areas that are crucial for fostering growth and improving competitiveness, such as the energy sector, the green transition and new technologies.  Perhaps, but the governments that are currently investing a lot of money are the United States and China. Meanwhile, Europe is talking the talk but not walking the walk.  On a standalone basis, no one European country can resist the allure of the US market and the money available through the Inflation Reduction Act. That’s why we must adopt a pan-European strategy, deploying common fiscal instruments, like we did with the Next Generation EU package in response to the pandemic. Our fiscal policies must remain prudent, but we must learn the lessons of the financial crisis. Then, we thought we could remedy the problems of high indebtedness by suppressing demand, when what was actually missing was growth. As a result, public investment declined, growth collapsed and debt ratios surged. We should never repeat those mistakes.   "
2023-05-24,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Les Echos,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Karl de Meyer ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Les Echos   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Karl de Meyer  24 May 2023  As the ECB celebrates its 25th anniversary today, where do things stand with the digital euro project that you are responsible for?  We are studying the design of the digital euro, its distribution and its impact on the financial sector. There are around 50 people in the team working on this project. We are in regular contact with the European Commission which is due to present a legislative proposal in June. This will provide the regulatory framework for the digital euro. Then in October the Governing Council will decide whether to launch a preparation phase to develop and test the digital euro. This phase could last two or three years. If the Governing Council and the European legislators – Member States and Members of the European Parliament – agree, we could launch the digital euro in three or four years.  Why does the euro area need a central bank digital currency?  To safeguard financial stability, we need to keep central bank money at the heart of the financial system. And we want to offer citizens a risk-free European digital means of payment that they can use free of charge anywhere in the euro area, in shops, online or for payments between individuals. Such a solution doesn’t exist at the moment. The digital euro will also provide a platform for European financial intermediaries to offer innovative payment services across the entire euro area. At present, services developed in one European country are often not available in others. And the European card payments market is dominated by two non-European companies whose cards are not accepted everywhere. Can you imagine a similar situation in the United States? And this situation would be exacerbated by the growth of big techs, which don’t hesitate to use their customers’ personal data to make money.   Some in the political world or from consumer associations are also worried about how the ECB could use the data collected via the digital euro.  The European Central Bank will not have access to personal data.  As for the financial intermediaries that will distribute the digital euro, a balance will need to be found between ensuring data confidentiality and combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  This balance will be determined by the legislator. In current discussions, some want to prioritise confidentiality, while others want to prioritise the fight against illegal activities.   What can we expect from the digital euro?  The simplicity of a payment instrument that is easy to use, available across the entire euro area and which will strengthen the use of our currency. Increased competition in the payments market and innovation based on this financial “raw material” that we will make available to European financial intermediaries. And greater monetary sovereignty.  In concrete terms, what will people be able to do with their digital euro account?  The ECB will ensure that all users benefit from a basic service that enables payments between individuals, retailers and public authorities. Europeans will, for example, be able to use it to pay online or in shops, to send money to their loved ones or to pay their taxes. And banks will be able to offer additional features such as recurring payments, payments based on usage or access to other financial services.   Some commercial banks are clearly concerned that the ECB might take some of their business.  We have been very clear: the ECB would issue the digital euro but would not distribute it. Citizens will not have an account at the ECB or at the national central banks. We do not have any expertise in dealing with customers, and it would not make sense for us to enter into this business. And we are not looking to gain a large market share. We want to build a presence everywhere, but be dominant nowhere. Europeans will know that they always have the option to use the digital euro, but they will only use it for a fraction of their payments. We are not seeking to expand the role of public money, but rather to preserve it, as in its current form – cash – its use is declining. Making the digital euro available as a complement to cash is a natural development in an increasingly digital economy.  Why will digital euro accounts be capped?  Because we don’t want to create tensions for financial intermediaries that could negatively affect the financing of the economy and the transmission of monetary policy. The digital euro would be a means of payment, not a form of investment or savings. We have at times mentioned a ceiling of €3,000. This amount is close to the average gross salary in the euro area and would not cause problems for financial stability. Larger payments will be possible thanks to a link between digital euro accounts and traditional bank accounts.  Just to make it clear: the idea is not for the digital euro to replace cash is it?  Absolutely not. We are working on issuing a new series of high-tech banknotes with a view to preventing counterfeiting and reducing the environmental impact. We will make banknotes available to citizens for as long as there is demand for them. But it’s possible to imagine that one day the digitalisation of the economy could lead to cash becoming marginalised. We cannot run the risk that central bank money is no longer used. That’s why we need a digital euro.  Will these new banknotes that you just mentioned feature well-known European figures?  We want people to relate to the new series of banknotes we are working on. We are considering a number of themes, including European culture, and we will soon consult the wider public.  Personally, I would like to see famous Europeans represented on our future banknotes.  The interoperability of the digital euro with other central bank digital currencies is another important topic…  We are already working closely with the central banks of the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Sweden. We are in a preliminary stage where we compare notes on our progress. But interoperability will require more work. For example, while interoperability is desirable, different national rules on confidentiality would make it more challenging.  The ECB is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary. What progress do you think Europe will make in the next 25 years?  If we, as Europeans, want to continue to play a role on the world stage, we need to act together. We need to make further progress towards closer integration, introduce more efficient decision-making processes, and develop a permanent fiscal capacity at the European level. We need to be able to provide a common response to crises, as we did during the pandemic. A European fiscal policy that complements monetary policy would enable us to avoid many tensions and imbalances.    "
2023-05-14,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Isabella Bufacchi","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Isabella Bufacchi 14 May 2023  With seven hikes in one year, the ECB has raised interest rates at a very rapid pace, by a total of 375 basis points, to bring inflation back to its 2% medium-term target. This unprecedented monetary policy tightening has come after many years of low rates, and at the same time as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought war to Europe, as well as the energy crisis and the risk of recession. Beyond just price stability, does the ECB take into consideration the impact of this monetary policy tightening on banks and financial stability?  Our mandate is price stability and tightened monetary policy is a response to the very high inflation we face. This has fallen from the 10.8% we saw in October last year, but it remains high. Still, despite the very strong tightening cycle, we have not seen any financial stability problems. Yields on government bonds have increased, but spreads have remained fairly stable. This rise in interest rates has not resulted in greater fragmentation. Moreover, European banks’ balance sheets are improving, with higher-than-expected profits in the first quarter of this year. There is some tension in the European non-bank financial intermediary sector, which is highly leveraged and more exposed to liquidity risk, but nothing comparable to the banking crisis in the United States.  And do you consider the effects on households and businesses, and on the economy?  We do. Higher interest rates have started to affect businesses, but there has been neither a wave of defaults, nor of fallen angels (bonds once rated as investment grade now downgraded to speculative grade). Regarding households, a strong labour market continues to offer support for coping with tighter financing conditions. So far so good, I would say. But, of course, we continue to monitor the situation and we take a wide range of indicators into account.   There were fears that the ECB’s highly restrictive monetary policy would only be able to tackle inflation at the cost of a recession in the euro area, but that does not appear to be the case…  Indeed, our forecasts in December pointed to a technical recession, but we revised them in March. Growth was flat in the fourth quarter of 2022, and slightly better in the first quarter of 2023. The euro area managed to avoid a technical recession. Nevertheless, contractionary monetary policy serves to tighten financing conditions and we have started to see this being felt on the market for bank loans. Banks have started to tighten lending conditions, which shows that monetary policy transmission is working. And we will see what impact this will have on the real economy.   The Governing Council’s latest decision was to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, a smaller increase than the previous 50 and 75 basis-point rate hikes. However, the language used in the monetary policy decisions and by President Christine Lagarde at the press conference was more hawkish than dovish: “We have more ground to cover”, “we are not pausing”…  A quarter of a percentage point is “the normal” monetary policy rate hike. Hikes of 50 and 75 basis point were extraordinary steps in response to extremely high inflation. We have had to raise rates by 375 basis points: it was an important stage in our journey and inflation is in fact coming down. But we have now entered the home stretch of our monetary policy tightening path. And that’s why we are returning to normality, to 25 basis-point steps.  Were you in favour of a 25 basis-point hike, or would you have preferred 50?  Raising rates by 25 basis points was the right decision. I was in favour, even during our preliminary discussions on the Executive Board. And then, the overwhelming majority of the Governing Council supported the proposal. You could even say that there was virtually unanimous support for a quarter of a point.  And what’s next?  Looking ahead, it will depend on the data. We will decide on a meeting-by-meeting basis. And based on the evidence of how the tightening of financing conditions has worked. And on the path of inflation, headline and core.   Which of the two matters more: headline or core inflation?  Both will ease in the coming months. Energy prices will be key in determining headline inflation. We will need to consider the base effect as well as the impact of government support measures coming to an end. But core inflation will also be telling. It is a useful indicator for predicting inflation over the medium term. In this regard, I am concerned about service prices, which account for a large share of core inflation. Demand for services in Europe, for example in Italy and Spain, is very strong and highly sensitive to wage and labour market developments. We need to closely observe the impact of wages and services on core inflation.  At its last meeting, the Governing Council also decided to discontinue reinvestments of maturing securities in the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio as of July 2023. Meanwhile the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) remains untouched, with no sales of securities before maturity: how meaningful is quantitative tightening (QT) as a restrictive monetary policy tool when applied to reinvestments under the APP only?  Interest rates are our primary monetary policy tool. Reducing and then stopping reinvestments under the APP, the so-termed QT, is fully aligned with our monetary policy stance. It works in parallel with raising interest rates and reinforces the tightening. We think it has led to an increase of 60-70 basis points in ten-year government bond yields. But the main tightening comes from the rate increase of 375 basis points, as that is our primary monetary policy tool. We will publish more data on the impact of our tightening in the coming days, but, still, calculations should always be taken with caution. Overall, effective communication of QT and the Transmission Protection Instrument have helped to avoid market turmoil with the end of reinvestments under the APP.  Another important tool is also under the spotlight, namely loans under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). In coming months, the banks will repay €477 billion: can you confirm whether a kind of “bridge loan” formula is envisaged to mitigate the impact of this bumper repayment?  The TLTROs have served as an extraordinary tool in extraordinary situations, for example the pandemic, which is now over. Banks have planned to make repayments based on the roadmap. I expect that, for the June tranche, banks – even those that have made most use of the TLTROs – will not have any trouble rebuilding this liquidity. Apart from the alternatives of the main refinancing operations and longer-term refinancing operations, in extraordinary cases, we may revert to using TLTROs themselves as a valid alternative. They remain part of our toolbox.   Banks have had worse things to worry about than TLTROs: first the pandemic, followed by the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and inflation. They have overcome many crises up to now.  Euro area banks are resilient in terms of capital and liquidity. And now, thanks to the higher margins from the rise in interest rates, profits are increasing as well. But we mustn’t drop our guard. We need to be very cautious: the combination of a slowing economy and the interest rate hikes will bring a rise in the cost of funding for banks and possibly an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs). At the moment, the improvement in margins more than compensates for the potential losses from the growth in NPLs. But we need to keep a close eye on developments.  And what about Italy’s banks?   Italian banks are in a very different situation to that of 10-12 years ago. Their resilience is not in doubt: they have more capital, are more liquid and have cleaned up their balance sheets, with NPLs falling to an unprecedented level of slightly below 2.5% of total assets. But just as for all European banks, everything will depend on how the economy performs. The resilience of businesses and households will be key. We do not expect a wave of NPLs, but now is not the time for complacency.   Are there lessons to be learned from the banking crisis in the United States?  The crisis that hit US regional banks served as a wake-up call: we saw how market sentiment can change abruptly. The situation in Europe is different. It is not so exposed to the systemic risks faced by the US regional banks and has, for example, a much larger retail deposit base. But the fact remains that digitalisation and social media can play a role in quickly driving bank runs. That’s why I am convinced that the EDIS (European deposit insurance scheme) is a crucial step. It is imperative that we complete banking union by equipping ourselves with the EDIS. Having an incomplete banking union could end up being one of the biggest chinks in our armour. I would even say that lacking the EDIS is the main vulnerability for the European banking system. Not introducing it would be a serious mistake.    "
2023-05-10,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Nikkei,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Shogo Akagawa on 8 May 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Nikkei   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Shogo Akagawa on 8 May 2023 10 May 2023  You repeatedly mentioned at the last press conference that the inflation outlook continues to be “too high for too long”. How strong is the upside risk of inflation in the eurozone?   There are factors that can induce significant upside risks to the inflation outlook. And we are still in a situation where uncertainty about the path of inflation is high, so we have to be extremely attentive to those potential risks, the exact list of which you will find in our latest monetary policy statement, in particular in relation to wage increases in various European countries.   We now see waves of strikes across Europe. How serious is the risk of a wage-price spiral as a second-round effect?  The protests, collective bargaining and, in some cases, strikes that we observe in Europe are not surprising, because last year was one where real wages went down significantly. And there is now a process of catching up and making up for the lost ground in real wage terms. The numbers appear large on the face of it. Take for example the recent wage agreements in Germany and Spain, which are both in double digits over a period of two and three years respectively. It’s a catch-up process that is taking place, but we have to remain very vigilant.   Europe’s macroeconomic situation now seems to be better. Do you think the eurozone could avoid recession and that the growth rate will remain positive?  We do not have a recession in our baseline projection for 2023, and we are in a better position than what we feared six months ago. Back then everybody was talking about at least a technical recession, and we have avoided that over the winter.  This is attributable to various factors, but two are key: first, the fall in energy prices; second, the easing of the supply bottlenecks, which have impacted manufactured goods in particular. We’re seeing that easing in shipping, the price of freight, delays indicated by corporations, the level of inventories – all of these indicators are pointing in the same direction. And if you add to that some still-lagging effects of the recovery that took place a few months ago, we have a series of factors which point to more positive growth than we had anticipated . But we still have a lot of uncertainty out there, including what will happen in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and some emerging signs of weakness in demand for manufactured goods.  How significant do you think geopolitical risk is for Europe’s future? Are you concerned about the impact on energy supplies of the Russian aggression?   Even without any Russian supplies, the European position is solid. We went through the winter season without rationing, without massive disruption. That was down to three factors. First, in part, the mild weather. Second, our ability to find alternative sources of supply, particularly gas. And third, the capacity of Europeans to actually reduce their demand. But we have to be attentive, and energy remains one of the uncertainties that can affect future output as well as inflation numbers.  How long will you keep your tightening cycle? Can we exclude a rate hike in the autumn?  Given the process that we have adopted and the environment in which we operate, we’ve decided two things: one, we will be data-dependent; and two, our reaction function will determine the data that will be important to us. Our reaction function will be anchored in the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, and this will dictate our decisions going forward.  Between core inflation and headline inflation, which is the most important statistic for the European Central Bank (ECB) to analyse monetary policy?  Headline inflation is the measure that we target and that we have agreed will determine whether or not we deliver price stability. This is because what ultimately matters are the prices that people directly experience, and that means we need to target a measure that includes food and energy. That’s our thermometer, that’s what we are committed to doing. We do, however, look at measures of underlying inflation. “Core” is one such measure, but there are also others – for example, those that exclude more volatile items or focus more on domestic inflation pressures. And why do we filter inflation in that way? It’s to arrive at the “heart” of inflation, the most persistent element in those price indexes that can help us understand where headline inflation is likely to settle in the medium term. That’s a good way to identify in real time whether our policy action is actually biting, and whether we see supporting evidence that, yes, we have attacked inflation hard enough.  There is some criticism that the ECB reacted too late when beginning to raise interest rates. What is your response?  We were coming from ten years of very accommodative monetary policy. But we completely changed tack – and rapidly. We started changing our policies already in December 2021, when we announced that we would discontinue net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and gradually reduce net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP). We later announced that we would conclude net purchases under the APP and started rate hikes in July 2022. Since then we have raised rates by 375 basis points in less than a year – the fastest increase in our history. So we have moved in a very deliberate and decisive way in order to fight inflation. Could it have been done a little earlier? Possibly. Would it have made a huge difference? Probably not. What I know is that we are determined to tame inflation, to bring it back to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner, and we have made a sizeable adjustment already. But we still have more ground to cover.   Regarding the APP, do you think it is necessary to go further and start selling assets? Regarding the PEPP, the ECB intends to reinvest until at least the end of 2024. Do you have any plans to accelerate the end of these reinvestments?   We have just announced that we expect to discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023. Nothing further has been discussed by the Governing Council – neither a proposal to sell assets under the APP, nor a change to the forward guidance that we have given in relation to the PEPP. We have also mentioned that we would use flexibility in relation to the PEPP, if necessary to facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy, and there is no change to that at all.  What lessons can you draw from the financial market turmoil triggered by Credit Suisse and US banks, and how do you account for them in financial regulation and ECB stress tests of European banks? What do you think of risks from non-banks?  A first lesson, probably, will be that we have to apply the existing regulatory framework scrupulously. I’m talking here about Basel III. Second, the Basel III set of rules needs to apply to a large set of banking institutions, not to a narrow group. Third, supervision needs to be intrusive and as granular as possible. Fourth, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision should look very carefully at the non-bank financial sector to make sure that we do not have significant risks on the horizon.   How do you deal with Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds?  Concerning AT1, in the EU we have clarified that we have a pecking order which requires equity holders to be the first port of call in the event of losses. And we have made clear that there is no possibility for this to be changed, even by contractual arrangement, because it’s the Capital Requirements Directive that applies throughout the EU.  When do you plan to launch the digital euro? Is 2027 the goalpost for launching?  The next step will be in October 2023 when the Governing Council will have to decide whether we move into the next phase – experimenting with the digital euro. During that next phase we will be checking all the potential errors, the potential traps, the potential shortfalls, the way in which it will operate on a cross-border basis. After this phase is over, the decision will be made to finally launch it or not. I don’t have a set date, but it would not surprise me if it was 2026 or 2027.  Compared to the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of England, one of the characteristics of the ECB is that the eurozone includes smaller markets that depend on communicating with bigger markets. Is fighting euro scepticism a difficulty in your job?  You are right that in Europe we have a fragmented capital market. We do not yet have a capital markets union, and it’s an added difficulty because we are talking to multiple markets that are smaller than the market Governor Ueda is talking to – he is talking primarily to the Tokyo market – and then of course to all the other markets in the world, because we’re not addressing only one geographic market. Markets are cross-border.  You now have 20 Member States in the eurozone, which could increase in the future. Is there any dilemma, as you always have to seek consensus in your Governing Council?  I think overall, in very tough and uncertain times, in almost all cases, we have managed to rally enough consensus around the table. I would like to think that it is because of me, but I think it has more to do with the fact that we are all driven by the same objective, which is our mandate. We are all driven by the public interest of the European Union and the euro area, and we are prepared to make compromises. There are different perspectives and intellectual backgrounds as well as macroeconomic circumstances. If you look at, for instance, Latvia and compare it with Malta, you are talking about completely different inflation rates. The structure of the German economy is different from that of Italy or Spain. This has to do with the way in which those economies were built over the course of history. It is that very rich diversity that comes together around the table to form a common view on the optimal policy to arrive at price stability. And so far it’s worked. And it’s also my way of working; I’m not a dictatorial central bank governor.    The G7, especially Europe, has a role in leading the discussion on sanctions against Russia. How can the effectiveness of sanctions be improved? How can the ECB contribute to this?   We can spot unusual flows of funds in and out and we can mention to the appropriate authorities what we observe. That’s our contribution to the sanctions. In addition to finding loopholes, it’s important for the Member States and the European Commission to identify the ways in which some people try to circumvent and to bypass the sanctions so that they can be implemented with full efficiency.  What impact will “greenflation” and “decarbonisation” have on monetary policies in the long term?  In the long run, if our economies rely more substantially on renewable energies, the impact will be disinflationary. But in the short term, we know that investments will be needed in significant amounts, both to invest in these renewable energy production facilities and also to invest in fossil energy – such as liquified natural gas terminals – in order to transition smoothly to the green energy that everybody is calling for. So, in the first instance, there is likely to be an element of price increases as a result of this massive flow of investment. In the very short term, what has caused energy prices to go up is not so much green policies but the increase in electricity prices caused by the sudden cut-off of Russian gas. So, the contribution to high prices is to be found in the fossil fuel industry, not “greenflation”.  Over the past decade the political pressure on central banks, including the ECB, has been increasing, because the central bank can avoid parliamentary decisions and react very quickly. Could this lead to difficulties in maintaining independence?  Number one, the independence of the ECB is enshrined in the Treaty that founded the EU. It’s in the hardest law that we can have. And it’s very, very specifically mentioned that European leaders cannot try to influence me or my colleagues in any particular shape or form. This would be against the law. Second, we have a mandate, which assigns us one objective, not two like at the Federal Reserve. Our objective is price stability. And third, I’m accountable to the European Parliament. Every quarter I present our policy decisions, our assessment of the macroeconomic situation, and I take all the questions that they have for me to explain and document and justify the decisions that we’ve made. So you have a combination of independence, narrow mandate and accountability, and the three of them form the operational framework in which we function.   "
2023-04-25,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Le Monde ,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert on 18 April 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Monde    Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert on 18 April 2023 25 April 2023  Last autumn, a euro area recession at the beginning of 2023 seemed inevitable. Has it been avoided?  Yes, the indicators show that the European economy has been growing in the first few months of the year. The main factors behind this have been the fall in energy prices, especially gas prices, and the easing of bottlenecks. This has caused a visible improvement in the confidence of consumers and firms.  In March, the ECB was forecasting euro area growth of 1% for 2023. Are we still on track?  That forecast remains reasonable. But I must emphasise that there are still factors that are causing significant uncertainty: there are many questions about the state of the world economy, about Russia’s war against Ukraine, and about the impact of monetary tightening. It’s important to remember the scale of the challenges facing Europe and the world economy. After a fairly long period of falling gas prices, the weather could turn, the war could deteriorate even further, or there could be more changes in OPEC policy. All this could increase energy prices. And central banks around the world have been hiking interest rates, which has been necessary, but there is a lot of uncertainty about the impact of this policy – about whether it will deliver a soft landing for the world economy or result in a downside risk to economic performance.  So, essentially, it’s a bit better than expected, but the economy is still more or less stagnant?  Not stagnant but, compared with what we expected before the pandemic and before the Russian war against Ukraine, the European economy is currently on a much more modest path.  One of the positives is that euro area unemployment has remained quite low, at 6.6%. Does this partly explain the resilience of the European economy?  It’s good news. For many people, the worst-case scenario is losing their job. So a strong labour market is an important confidence factor for consumption. I would point out that the strength of the labour market has been associated with a strong return of immigration into the euro area. We were concerned that there might be less immigration after the pandemic, but it looks like it has come back. It is a source of labour for all of those industries that have been experiencing worker shortages. The participation rate of older workers is also much better. And working from home has enabled many people to join the labour force. All this allows the labour supply to grow and it’s why we can have a strong labour market without wage pressures necessarily overheating.  So you don’t see the beginning of a wage-price spiral? That was a major worry for central banks.  Last year, wages were relatively slow to move. Many firms were able to increase their profits. This year wages are growing at around 5%, well above their normal rate, but we expect a slowdown later this year.  For most households that is still a decrease in real terms…  As a result of the energy shock, the euro area now pays a lot more for its energy imports. This is a collective loss that cannot be escaped. We have to accept that there cannot be total protection from price increases due to higher energy prices. Unfortunately, living standards do have to adjust to it.  Inflation has been falling quite a lot, from a peak of 10.6% for the euro area last October to 6.9% in March. Is it under control?  This significant drop is welcome, as it reduces pressure on the cost of living. Inflation should continue to fall because of the easing of supply chain bottlenecks following the normalisation of the economy after the pandemic, and because of the reversal of the energy situation. Nevertheless, for central banks, it’s not the drop from 10.6% to 6.9% that’s most important. What’s most important is making sure that we get close to our target of 2% within a reasonable time period.  Why “within a reasonable time period”?  Inflation has been above our target since the middle of 2021, so inflation has been too high for almost two years. And the longer inflation stays too high, the greater the risk that people’s perceptions will change, that they will lose faith in our ability to return to our 2% target. That is not the case at the moment, but it’s why we want to return inflation to 2% in a timely manner.  You have already increased interest rates by 3.5 percentage points (the ECB’s deposit rate has increased from ‑0.5% to 3%), which is unprecedented in the history of the euro area. How effective has this measure been so far?  The markets and banks are starting to charge much higher interest rates. As a result, for households we are seeing a strong fall in demand for mortgages. For firms, we are seeing a substantial drop in investment. The interest rate increases have also supported a strong appreciation of the euro. All of these impacts will continue to filter through the economy – this is going to continue to play out.  In this context, at what point should you stop raising rates?  For our next Governing Council meeting on 4 May, the current data are indicating that we should raise rates again. This is still not the right time to stop. Beyond that, I don’t have a crystal ball; it will depend on the economic data. But the analysis suggests that it would be inappropriate to leave our deposit rate at the current level of 3%.  Inflation has been very high since autumn 2021. Are you not worried that it has become “sticky”?  “Sticky” would mean that inflation will remain where it is. But that is not what is happening. There are many phenomena underlying the current inflation figures. First of all, we had the pandemic, which created many bottlenecks. Then there was the energy shock due to the Russian war against Ukraine. Today, it’s food prices that are very high. But on the flip side, energy prices are falling more quickly than expected. Inflationary pressures remain in certain sectors of the economy, but are easing in others. I don’t think we are in a 1970s-style situation, when inflation was in fact sticky. But there is a risk that we could end up there. That is why it’s important that the ECB raises its interest rates to ensure inflation returns to 2% in a timely manner.  In March, the beginnings of a banking crisis shook the markets. How do you see the situation?  The banking issues in the United States [collapse of SVB] and Switzerland [turmoil at Crédit Suisse until it was taken over by UBS] sparked a series of questions about the European banking system. There was some contagion, but investors very quickly understood that the euro area banking system is very different because it’s closely supervised, and that the problems we saw in the United States and Switzerland are less likely to materialise in the euro area. It of course remains the case that the large increase in interest rates entails a significant adjustment for the financial system.  Christine Lagarde, the President of the ECB, has repeatedly called on governments to reduce their support for firms and households with regard to gas and electricity bills. Why?  There are two messages here. First, governments decided on their subsidy programmes when gas prices were very high. Now they are falling, it’s logical for us to recommend that governments reduce these subsidies. And second, if fiscal policy injects less stimulus into the economy, inflationary pressures will be lower over the coming years. As a result, inflation will return to our 2% target more quickly, meaning interest rates would not need to rise more than necessary.  Does that mean that the era of free money is over?  Let’s differentiate between two phases. First of all, it’s true that nominal interest rates will be elevated for the next few years. But after that, even when inflation has returned to our target of around 2%, financial markets are not expecting interest rates to return to the very low levels we had before the pandemic. On the contrary – markets expect rates to normalise at around 2%. This means that the era we were living in for a long time before the pandemic and during the pandemic itself – one of extremely low interest rates – should not return. But let’s not forget that, in the long term, an interest rate of around 2% is not particularly high. All of the factors that existed before the pandemic – an ageing population, low growth, etc. – are still relevant. So I would not exaggerate the turnaround in the situation.   "
2023-04-24,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Politico,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck on 20 April 2023 ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Politico   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck on 20 April 2023  24 April 2023  Since the last policy meeting, core inflation rose along with market-based inflation expectations and still some of your colleagues say that we should slow tightening. Is that also your view or are you open for another 50-basis point move in May?  Let me start with my general view on recent inflation developments. We are seeing a change in the drivers of inflation. It started with supply-side shocks – bottlenecks and rising energy prices –, which are now fading, while at the same time the demand-side factors are gaining importance. The macroeconomy has proven quite resilient. Industrial production is expanding. The services sector is recovering pretty quickly and wage growth is picking up. What happens to inflation is going to depend on the relative importance of these different factors. Headline inflation is coming down relatively quickly, due to the sharp decline in energy price inflation. But core inflation continues to surprise on the upside. It shows a very strong momentum, and it stands at a historical high. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, plus the very strong momentum in food inflation, it's far too early to declare victory on inflation.  People talk a lot about a potential peak in core inflation. I would not overemphasise the peak as such, because what really matters is that inflation is returning to our two percent target over the medium term. We need to see a sustained decline in core inflation that gives us confidence that our measures are starting to work. Concerning the May meeting, we made it very clear that the decision is going to be strictly data dependent. So, we are going to look at all the available data at that point in time. The data we have so far shows that inflation is higher and the economy more resilient than projected. But we're also seeing first signs of transmission of our interest rate hikes. Already before the banking turbulence, there was a slowdown in loan growth. The recent financial turbulences have led to higher uncertainty and are likely to lead to a further tightening in financing conditions. This certainly needs to be taken into account when assessing the transmission of the measures that we have already taken. So I would say it's clear that further rate hikes are needed, but the size of the rate hikes is going to depend on the incoming data.  Does that imply that 50 basis points are not off the table for you?  Data dependence means that 50 basis points are not off the table.  You said there is an over emphasis on a peak in core inflation. Do you expect core inflation to peak soon or is there a pronounced risk that core inflation could surprise on the upside time and again just like headline inflation did last year?  So far, core inflation has continued to move up. There is a lot of uncertainty, and this is why we really need to look at the incoming data. I think it's quite likely that core inflation is going to peak over the coming months, but it’s not clear that that is going to happen very soon. And, again, you are putting a lot of emphasis on the peak. The peak is a single data point. If core inflation is reaching a peak, but it remains very high and very persistent, the information content of that data point may be relatively limited. So what we really need is confidence that it's actually coming down in a sustained manner.  How comfortable do you feel with the current terminal rate expectations of around 3.85%?  We're data dependent, that means that also the terminal rate will depend on the incoming data. If I cannot tell you what's going to happen in the next meeting, I certainly cannot tell you where the terminal rate is going to be. Interest rates must be set from meeting to meeting.  You will still have an assessment based on your baseline scenario even if the decision is data dependent?  I'm comfortable with the view that further rate hikes are needed. And beyond that, I'm not going to make any further predictions.  President Lagarde said in a recent speech that emerging geopolitical tensions could push up inflation. Do you share concerns over an additional source of price pressures?  There are different aspects to be considered. One is the current economic development in China, which is stronger than expected. This is going to have an impact on global growth, and hence on inflation. That is the story in the short run. I do not think geopolitical fragmentation is a short-term story, however. It affects the longer term. And the longer term is always more difficult to assess. I can see that geopolitical fragmentation has an impact on monetary policy to the extent that it affects the natural rate of interest, r*, and inflation. On r*, reshoring could lead to an increase in capital demand, which could go along with productivity increases, which would tend to increase r*. Geopolitical fragmentation could also mean that capital supply is coming down because capital does not flow as easily across regions, which would also speak in favour of a higher natural rate. On inflation, the entry of China into the world economy was a key disinflationary factor over the past decades. If that reverses, the effect on inflation could also reverse. That could be an important factor. Fragmentation could also lead to higher pricing power of firms, which could drive up inflation. On the other hand, higher productivity growth, if it were to materialise, could have a disinflationary effect. Overall, it's relatively hard to predict what precisely is going to happen.  So, the possible inflationary pressures stemming from geopolitical tensions is nothing that concerns you in the near term to the extent that you might consider adjusting your ECB staff forecasts?  No, it’s a longer-term development. In the short run, the recovery in China has a direct impact on our projections, although I don’t expect it to fundamentally change the inflation outlook.  Are you confident that there will not be a recession in the Eurozone?  According to our most recent projections, we are not seeing a recession. We now have to see whether the banking turbulence changes anything in that regard. So far, there are no particular signs of a weakening in economic developments. At this point in time, I have no reason to believe that a recession is coming.  Are you confident that the worst of the financial market tensions is behind us – even if the ECB keeps raising interest rates?  Let me say first that we've seen certain individual banking problems, and typically such problems are related to idiosyncratic causes due to poor business strategies. But we have to be aware of the fact that we are currently seeing a fundamental change in the macroeconomic environment. We are coming out of a very long period with very low interest rates. That was a period in which a number of financial fragilities were built up, which are now exposed by the rapid hiking cycle. Rising interest rates affect funding costs and asset prices, and they affect everybody at the same time, banks and non-banks. This poses challenges we need to take very seriously. What is key is financial regulation and supervision. They have to make sure that the financial sector is sound. If I look at the euro area banking sector, it appears quite resilient. Capital and liquidity ratios are high thanks to the reforms that have been implemented after the global financial crisis. It could be that risks are lurking in the non-bank sector, which has had fewer regulatory changes. Some investment funds, for example, are strongly leveraged. Many have engaged in massive maturity transformation. And investment funds are affected by the structural changes that we are seeing, for example, in commercial real estate where they are very active in the euro area. Due to the interconnections between banks and non-banks, these risks need to be monitored very carefully. That's mainly a task for regulators and supervisors. However, we said very clearly in our monetary policy strategy review that financial stability is a precondition for price stability, and vice versa. So, we cannot entirely ignore financial stability considerations. At the same time, it has to be clear that monetary policymakers have tools to deal with impairments to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and with liquidity crises, but we do not have the tools to ensure a safe and sound financial sector. That has to be done by the regulators and by the supervisors. We cannot succumb to financial dominance.  Can you see a situation where you would slow interest rate hikes because of concerns over the banking sector?  If we were getting close to an acute financial crisis, then of course we could not ignore it. Financial crises are disinflationary. That we know very well.  I would like to talk about quantitative tightening. There’s going to be a decision in June about the speed of unwinding your APP bond holdings. Do you think the ECB should significantly speed up the process or even halt reinvestments altogether after June?  At the moment, we are reducing our APP holdings on average by €15 billion per month. And what we've seen is that the market absorption has gone very smoothly. This is good news. We have not seen any abrupt price changes nor any financial disturbances. The goal is to completely phase out reinvestments under the APP, and the precise timing is going to be decided soon. We continue to be predictable. The phasing out has been well telegraphed to the markets. There is no surprise there. The amounts involved are relatively small.   What about PEPP? Can you envisage a scenario under which you would reduce reinvestments earlier than the currently foreseen end-2024?  We have not yet discussed whether there could be a change. So far, the guidance is full reinvestment until the end of 2024.   Why do you need to reduce bond holdings if this is seen as secondary to achieving your inflation target and the current outlook so uncertain?  I do think that reducing the balance sheet has to be part of our tightening strategy. How far that goes is an open question. We're currently reviewing our operational framework for monetary policy implementation. The outcome of that review is going to determine where we're going to end up. It's very hard to say where the precise endpoint is, but the choice of an operational framework has implications for whether we will have a very large or a smaller balance sheet in the steady state. It's well conceivable that in the steady state we will continue to have a structural bond portfolio, but that it is going to be much smaller than what we have now.  When will you come to a decision about what your operational framework is going to look like in future?  The goal is to finalise the review by the end of this year. We will have to see whether that will work out, but that's the current plan. Work has been going on for a couple of months. It’s a Eurosystem effort.  How would you respond to criticism that the ECB is not sufficiently transparent about how it applies flexibility in PEPP reinvestments?   We are quite transparent about our reinvestment policies. The general principle is that reinvestments are conducted in the asset class and the jurisdiction where the bonds fall due. But in June last year, we announced that under the PEPP, we would be willing to reinvest flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions in order to preserve the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism under stressed conditions. We publish the PEPP purchases across jurisdictions every two months. There you can see that the actual use of this flexibility was rather limited. So, the power of this tool comes from the fact that we stand ready to use it, not that we are necessarily using it. I think that is a very important point. But let me stress one other point for interpreting the numbers that are published. Temporary deviations from the capital key can also be due to a more technical feature, which is what we call the smoothing mechanism. We smooth out the purchases over the entire calendar year in order to ensure an even market presence over time. All of this is explained in detail on our website.  So, you would argue that suggestions that the ECB conducted QT for Germany and the Netherlands and QE for Italy and Spain this year are inaccurate?  Yes, that’s a wrong characterisation. Whether or not flexibility is used, you will find out at the end of the calendar year when these temporary deviations from the smoothing mechanism will have been balanced out.  The ECB is turning 25. What are your birthday wishes for the institution?  My birthday wishes are that the political leaders manage to make further progress on European integration including on the fiscal side, the banking union and the capital markets union in order to fully reap the benefits of the single monetary policy in a heterogeneous currency union.  When you say on the fiscal side, what do you mean specifically? Do you mean a permanent fiscal capacity?  One of the currently discussed topics is the Stability and Growth Pact. This is very important for the ECB. A functioning fiscal framework shields us from fiscal dominance and protects our independence. The ECB has a keen interest in a credible fiscal framework that ensures debt sustainability in a way that is growth-friendly, not procyclical and enforceable. That is very important to us. Beyond that, we need to start thinking about permanent common fiscal tools, because the currency union currently has a single monetary policy and national fiscal policies. So far, we have had good experience with the Next Generation EU programme. That was a very important step. Of course, that was a one-off tool. But we may need to think about going a step further, taking into account all of the valid concerns that exist about diluting incentives for fiscal discipline by debt mutualisation. This would have to be taken into account properly in the design of such a facility. But I think it still has to be the longer-term vision that we move towards a system where there are also fiscal tools at the European level.  You said that the experience with the Next Generation EU had been positive. So, has that addressed these concerns sufficiently?  I think one of the major strengths of the Next Generation EU programme is that it takes a structural perspective and that it's focused on fostering potential growth and hence also convergence in the euro area, which would be great progress.  Turning back to the Stability and Growth Pact, what is your view on the current reform proposal? Do they meet your three criteria of being growth friendly, not procyclical and enforceable?  This is very much in flux and I'm not the one who should comment in detail on these political proposals. But maybe the biggest weakness of the proposal is on the enforceability side and that needs to be discussed.   "
2023-04-06,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Cyprus News Agency,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gregory Savva on 5 April","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Cyprus News Agency   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gregory Savva on 5 April 6 April 2023    We’ve seen some recent banking failures in regional banks in the United States, which − along with the turmoil caused by Credit Suisse − have created some concerns for depositors and investors alike. Do you think there is a risk of these limited shocks turning into something systemic?  I think it’s important for everyone to understand the differences between the euro area, Switzerland and the US banking system. In the euro area we’ve had a very significant focus on making sure that the banks have high capital and liquidity ratios, that they are supervised in a strict way by the European Central Bank. For these reasons − and also because we see that the European economy is performing relatively well and is expected to grow by around 1% this year − and under these conditions, of course, we look carefully, but our assessment is that the euro area banking system is strong, it’s stable, and it is not as vulnerable as some of the banks you mentioned to changes in interest rates, to changes in the economy. So while we are always on guard, I think that everyone should understand the euro area banking system is in good shape.  So you believe that there are no similarities between what happened in the United States and the European banking system?  Let me emphasise that we are always looking closely and with great attention. But, because of the strict supervision, because European supervisors were on guard about the implications of rising interest rates for banks, it’s becoming increasingly clear that investors appreciate that the European banking system has prepared for the situation we face of rising interest rates, and that these risks are well contained. For this reason we should be confident about the state of the European banking system.  So do you think that there is no problem of rising interest rates creating unrealised losses on the European banks’ fixed investment, fixed-income portfolios?   This is one of the risks that is well understood and is exactly why it’s important to pay attention that the size of the bond portfolio that a bank holds is not too big, that it’s properly accounted for, it’s properly managed, and that the banks have enough capital to guard against any loss in value of these bonds. This is why − because of the supervision actions and because, also from the banks’ own point of view, it would be too risky to take chances on this − we do think this risk factor is quite contained. What I would say is, from the European Central Bank’s point of view, we have taken a step-by-step approach to monetary tightening since around the end of 2021 to now. There has been a significant increase in interest rates, but it’s been gradual, it’s been step-by-step, and that has given the European system time to adjust to this change in the situation.   Following this turmoil, a lot of economists in the euro area have pointed out that we should reconsider implementing the European deposit insurance scheme, the EDIS, thereby completing the banking union. Do you agree with that?  I think we all share a common vision, that where we want to end up is at the full banking union, which includes EDIS, a European deposit insurance scheme. But I think everyone should recognise that to arrive at that destination it’s a step-by-step process. It’s important that there is momentum, that all of the prerequisites, all of the necessary steps, need to be delivered. As you know, this has been a conversation for the last number of years. What we’ve seen this year reinforces the value, not only of a full banking union, but also a full capital markets union in Europe. So we share that vision, absolutely, but it’s not a one-day decision, it’s not an overnight decision; a lot of different elements need to be delivered for that to be achieved.  Let’s turn to monetary policy now. The European Central Bank has raised its interest rates since July last year – six times, if I’m not mistaken – and my question is, are we getting closer to a pause in rate hikes? Is monetary policy restrictive enough, or are more hikes needed to combat inflation in an effective way?  I think we were clear in our March meeting and we made a further increase then. A lot has been done, but we’ve also been clear that our next decision in May will depend on three factors. It will depend on the inflation outlook − every week we have more information coming in, on the March inflation number that just came out, and we will have the April inflation number as well, before we meet in May. Number two, we have to diagnose the underlying dynamic, not just the overall inflation rate, but our assessment of how quickly inflation is going to fall. Conversely, the main concern would be if we assessed that inflation was going to remain too high for too long. Then the third factor is how quickly these interest rate increases are restricting the economy and bringing down inflation. So for these reasons we have no longer indicated or pre-announced what the expectation is for the next meeting or for the upcoming meetings. I think we will be looking very carefully at all of these data in the coming weeks.  So I think it’s important for everyone to understand that, rather than asking me what the next interest rate decision will be, the focus should be on understanding every data point that comes in. Are we seeing signs that inflation is cooling? Are we seeing signs that interest rate increases are reducing credit, for example? Are they leading to lower investment, lower consumption, lower pressure on the economy and, therefore, lower inflation? We still have quite a long way to go between now and the May meeting, which is about a month away. So rather than trying to predict now what the decision will be, our attention will be on the incoming data. We will analyse these until the day of the meeting and make a decision then.  Everybody continues to expect a rate hike from you in the next monetary policy meeting. But you said you aren’t pre-announcing it as you did previously, so is it a rate hike but a lower one? Or what direction are you taking?  The best way to capture this – I have said this, and my colleagues I think have all said it – is that in March we had a set of macro projections for the coming months. If, by the time of the May meeting, those projections remain on track, then a rate hike will be appropriate. However, we need to be scientific and data-dependent, so in these weeks we have to see whether the incoming data support that projection from March. If they create more inflation concerns, that will move us in one direction; if they create less inflation concerns, that will move us in another direction. So I think the formula would be: if the baseline we developed before the banking stress holds up, it will be appropriate to have a further increase in May. However, we need to be data-dependent about the assessment of whether that baseline still holds true at the time of our May meeting.   There has been a recent development – I’m referring to OPEC’s decision to reduce oil production, sending international oil prices soaring. Does this development complicate the ECB’s monetary policy stance?  The overall price of energy – the mix between oil, gas and electricity – is, of course, a big part of the inflation dynamic. Just in terms of energy, we’ll have to weigh the movement in oil prices, and this should be seen in the context of a fairly large drop in recent months. This is some reversal of that trend, but in the context of a fairly negative trend, we’ve seen a very large ongoing reduction in gas prices, and the reduction in pressure from energy reduces the pressure on the rest of the economy. And it’s not only about the mechanical effect of energy prices – one of the biggest issues for us is how the rest of the economy responds to the energy dynamic. Last year we had a lot of pressure on many sectors, because their utility bills went up so much. This year, with gas really improving quite a bit and with oil declining until quite recently, this will also relieve pressure on many sectors. So this is why it is really quite uncertain. This is why the data inflow is so important, because it’s possible to debate many possibilities, and we really have to see, in an overall context, the net impact of these dynamics.  One last thing. There is a lot of criticism here in Cyprus, and I think elsewhere, that the ECB is proceeding with its monetary policy – with rate hikes – while disregarding the consequences for the real economy and for borrowers’ ability to repay their loans. How do you respond to that?  We work very hard to try to make balanced decisions. We fully take into account the impact of these interest rate increases on those who have debt, who face a bigger repayment challenge, and the implications for investment and for households. But please remember, the reason why we are raising interest rates now is because inflation is high. In order to make sure that inflation comes back to a low number, to around our 2% target, we do think it’s necessary, it’s unavoidable, to make these interest rate increases. If we did not do this, if we kept rates too low, we think inflation would remain too high for too long, and this would not serve anyone. It would mean, in fact, a tougher economic situation for a longer period of time. So a period now of raising interest rates is the best route to stability, is the best route to making sure the economy is in good shape, and that the cost of living stabilises. Of course it’s difficult for those who were hoping for low interest rates, but this is an important episode. It’s important for us at the ECB to make sure that the interest rate policy responds to the inflation challenge. And for those who are expressing these concerns, I’m sure they share my conviction that all of us need to see inflation come back down to a low number, around 2%, as soon as possible.  Besides, high inflation would hit them from a different perspective.  Right. Here and elsewhere, those that suffer most from high inflation are those on low incomes, who right now are facing very high food prices and still absorbing the increase in electricity and gas prices last year. It’s in everyone’s interest not to allow inflation to remain too high for too long.   "
2023-04-01,Fabio Panetta,Interview with The New York Times,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, published as an article by Eshe Nelson entitled “Are Big Profits Keeping Prices High? Some Central Bankers Are Concerned.” in The New York Times, 31 March 2023 ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with The New York Times   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, published as an article by Eshe Nelson entitled “Are Big Profits Keeping Prices High? Some Central Bankers Are Concerned.” in The New York Times, 31 March 2023  1 April 2023 After months of fretting about whether workers’ rising pay would keep inflation uncomfortably high, central bankers in Europe have another concern: large company profits. Companies that push up their prices above and beyond what is necessary to absorb higher costs could be fueling inflation that central bankers need to combat with higher interest rates, a policymaker at the European Central Bank warned, suggesting that governments might need to intervene in some situations. Policymakers, long preoccupied with higher pay’s tendency to prompt companies to raise their prices, generating a wage-price spiral, should also be alert to the risks of a so-called profit-price spiral, said Fabio Panetta, an executive board member at the E.C.B. At a conference in Frankfurt last week, he pointed out that in the fourth quarter of last year half of domestic price pressures in the eurozone came from profits, while the other half stemmed from wages. His concerns have been echoed in recent remarks by the E.C.B.’s president, Christine Lagarde, and the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey. Although inflation in Europe has begun to ease from last year’s double-digit peaks, the rates remain far above 2 percent, the target of most central banks. “There’s a lot of discussion on wage growth,” Mr. Panetta said in an interview this week. “But we are probably paying insufficient attention to the other component of income — that is, profits.” Profit margins at public companies in the eurozone — measured by net income as a percentage of revenue — averaged 8.5 percent in the year through March, according to Refinitiv, a step down from a recent peak of 8.7 percent in mid-February. Before the pandemic, at the end of 2019, the average margin was 7.2 percent. There has been a similar phenomenon in the United States, where companies reported wide profit margins last year despite the highest inflation in four decades. Companies could be increasing prices because of higher input costs (the expenses of producing their goods or services), or because they expect future cost increases, or because they have market power that allows them to raise prices without suffering a loss of demand, Mr. Panetta said. Some producers could be exploiting supply bottlenecks or taking advantage of this period of high inflation, which makes it more challenging for customers to be sure of the cause of price increases. “Given the situation which prevails in the economy, there could be ideal conditions for firms to increase their prices and profits,” he added.  “I’m not here to pass a judgment on how fair or unfair” price-setting is, Mr. Panetta insisted, but rather to explore all of the causes of inflation. He is a member of the E.C.B.’s six-person executive board that sets policy alongside the governors of the 20 central banks in the eurozone. There are sectors where “input costs are falling while retail prices are increasing and profits are also increasing,” Mr. Panetta said. “So this is enough to be worried as a central banker that there could be an increase in inflation due to increasing profits.” The average rate of inflation for the 20 countries that use the euro has been falling for five months — to 6.9 percent over the year through March — but core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, a measure used by policymakers to assess how deeply inflation is embedding in the economy, has continued to rise. Central bankers tend to focus on the risk that jumps in pay will lead to persistently high inflation, especially in Europe where wages tend to change more slowly than in the United States. The E.C.B. is even developing new tools to measure changes in wages more quickly. But this intense focus on wages has provoked some criticism. Mr. Bailey of the Bank of England was called out last year for suggesting workers should show restraint in asking for higher wages. As inflation persists, attention has turned to corporate profits. There is uncertainty about what will happen as prices for energy and other commodities keep falling: Will companies restrain themselves from raising prices further? Last week, Ms. Lagarde raised the issue of profits, saying there needed to be fair burden sharing between companies and workers to absorb the hit to the economy and income from higher energy prices. In Britain, Mr. Bailey told companies to bear in mind when setting prices that inflation was expected to fall. Across the Atlantic, last year Lael Brainard, who was then the vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, suggested that amid high profit margins in some industries, a reduction in markups could bring down inflation. In Europe, companies were able to protect their profit margins last year from high inflation more than expected, Marcus Morris-Eyton, a European equities analyst at Allianz Global Investor, said. “Corporates had more pricing power, at an average level, than most investors expected,” he said. This year, he expects there will be more variety in profit margins. “The average European company will face far greater margin pressure this year than they did last year,” Mr. Morris-Eyton said. That’s because of higher wage costs but “partly because as input costs have fallen, there is greater pressure from your customers to lower prices.” Last year, record-breaking profits by energy producers angered consumers who faced high energy bills, while governments spent billions to protect households from some of those costs. But as energy prices have fallen, consumers are still experiencing rising food prices. In the eurozone, the annual rate of food inflation rose to 15.4 percent in March. “To a certain extent there’s been also an opportunistic move by some big manufacturers to actually increase their prices, sometimes above their own cost increases,” said Christel Delberghe, the director general of EuroCommerce, a Brussels-based organization representing wholesale and retail companies. “It’s kind of a free-riding on a high price environment.” It’s a factor squeezing retail profits, alongside the rising costs of products they buy and resell and higher cost of operations. There is a notable disparity in profit margins between food producers and retailers, a traditionally low-margin business. Unilever and Nestlé each reported profit margins in the high teens for 2022, while the French supermarket company Carrefour reported a margin of about 3 percent. Unilever raised prices for its products more than 11 percent last year and Nestlé more than 8 percent, but in both cases the companies said they had not passed on all the effects of higher costs to consumers. Ms. Delberghe said she feared the blame for higher prices was unfairly going to land on retailers. “We’re extremely worried because indeed there is this perception that prices are going up and that it’s very unfair,” she said. Retail businesses are getting a lot of pushback, including from governments trying to take action to stop price increases in stores. Mr. Panetta said governments should step in where necessary, in part because their fiscal support programs have helped keep profits high. “If there is a sector in particular where market power is abused or there is insufficient competition, then there should be competition policies that should intervene,” he said. But it was also a message to companies.  “It should be clear to producers that strategies based on high prices that increase profits and inflation may turn out to be costly for them,” he said. The cost? Higher interest rates.   "
2023-03-30,Frank Elderson,Interview with El País,"Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Lluís Pellicer","  INTERVIEW  Interview with El País   Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Lluís Pellicer 30 March 2023  You have said that euro area banks are safe. Are all the channels of financial crisis contagion closed?  The euro area banking system is sound and resilient: it has robust capital and liquidity levels. And we have implemented the post-crisis regulatory regime, with rigorous supervision. Moreover, the ECB stands ready and has the necessary tools available to provide liquidity to the system if needed. President Lagarde made it very clear: there is no trade-off between price stability and financial stability. We are not caught between a rock and a hard place, as our decision to raise interest rates by 50 basis points shows.  Things are still turbulent two weeks on from the start of the crisis. Do you think it will be necessary to use those tools?  As I said, the banks are resilient, they are well capitalised and they are well supervised.  Some people are drawing parallels between the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis and the Bear Stearns crisis in 2008. Could we be on the verge of another crisis like that one?  No, this situation is very different. There was a strong agenda of regulatory reforms in Europe after the great financial crisis. Those changes have been implemented and the banks are subject to Basel III and to European banking supervision. Besides, SVB had a very unusual business model, which was highly exposed to interest rate risk and had a highly concentrated deposit base. Among the banks supervised by the ECB, the business models that rely more on deposits are more diversified.  But some analysts believe that the abrupt interest rate hikes by central banks after an era of ultra-low rates are also behind the banking crises…  One thing is clear: inflation is too high and we have to bring it down. That is what has driven our monetary policy tightening. Financial stability is a precondition for achieving price stability, as it is necessary for the smooth transmission of monetary policy. But as I already said: we have instruments to cater for both aspects. In the specific case of SVB, the bank was extremely exposed to interest rate adjustments, and its core business was highly concentrated. These characteristics are not as salient in euro area banks.  Could Switzerland’s decision to impose losses on holders of high-risk bonds before shareholders have consequences for the euro area banking system?  Euro area banks’ exposure to the high-risk Credit Suisse bonds that were wiped out is very limited. Moreover, in the European Union shareholders always absorb losses first – those high-risk instruments are only affected thereafter. This approach has been followed consistently and will continue to guide our actions in crisis cases, as we recently reiterated in a joint statement with the Single Resolution Board and the European Banking Authority.  At the last Governing Council meeting you decided to push ahead with your plan and raise interest rates to 3%. Would you have taken the same decision today?  At the last Governing Council meeting we agreed on an interest rate hike that had already been indicated in February. In view of the prevailing outlook, with inflation remaining far too high, that decision is as robust today as it was when we took it. That being said, it is true that, given the uncertain impact of recent market tensions on the inflation outlook, we didn’t indicate any specific intentions about future decisions, as we had done in the past. Instead, in our view it was best to be clear about our reaction function – that is, to explain the elements that we will consider in the future when taking decisions. There are three elements: the inflation outlook, based on our analysis of the incoming economic and financial data; the underlying inflation dynamics; and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In other words, we are not pre-empting the decisions we will take in the future, but we remain committed to ensuring that inflation returns to our 2% target in the medium term.  So you didn’t agree to raise rates by half a percentage point to avoid sending a pessimistic message to the markets?  We had already made it clear in February that this was our intention. At the time there was already a high degree of uncertainty owing to a number of factors: the aftermath of the pandemic, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine and the ongoing climate and environmental crises. And now the financial market tensions come on top of that. However, it was clear that inflation was still far too high, and keeping it in check is our primary objective. That led us to deliver on our intention to raise interest rates by 50 basis points. The increased uncertainty also led us to give very clear guidance on our reaction function.  Before the Governing Council meeting, the Spanish Government called on you to be prudent in the light of the market tensions. Were you?  We need to deliver on our price stability objective. European citizens trust us to deliver on it, and we owe it to them. In our last meeting we sent a very strong signal of our commitment to this. I am very aware of how difficult the current economic and financial circumstances make it for many people, also in Spain, to get to the end of the month. Since we started to raise rates, monthly payments on variable rate mortgages, which are very common in Spain, have increased by €400 on average. I understand how frustrating that is. But you have to differentiate between the illness, which is inflation, and the medicine, which is the interest rate hikes. A lot of medicine tastes bitter, but if you don’t take it, the illness gets worse. And in this case, if high inflation becomes entrenched, it will be the people who are already suffering the most that will end up paying the price.  That metaphor takes me back to ten years ago, when we were told that austerity was a pill we had to swallow in order to recover, but it ended up being harmful…  I understand what you are saying, but the best thing we can do is make sure that inflation returns to our 2% target as soon as possible. That is our task, and that is what we are committed to doing. So we have to go through this hiking phase. Besides, this situation is completely different from what happened over a decade ago. The ECB has been quick to act and had an accommodative policy stance that was crucial for navigating the effects of the pandemic. We are now in a different situation, one where high inflation is the biggest problem, and, again, we need to act.     ECB staff now see inflation averaging 2.1% in 2025, only ten basis points above the ECB’s target. Does this mean that the interest rate hikes will start to slow down?  Our latest projections, which were finalised in early March, foresee headline inflation at 2.1% towards the end of 2025 and core inflation a little higher, at 2.2%. These projections are based on technical assumptions with a cut-off date of 15 February and therefore do not take into account recent market developments. This is precisely why we wanted to make our reaction function clear – to show that we have to take decisions based on the incoming data. The data evolve, and our assessment along with them. That’s why we cannot pre-empt today any decision to be taken in May.  You have raised interest rates six times in nine months, from -0.5% to 3%. Are you not afraid of damaging the economy?  If it becomes entrenched, the high inflation we are experiencing in the euro area will inflict substantial damage on the economy and mainly affect the most disadvantaged. The ECB must counter it. That is our mandate. And our primary tool to fight inflation is interest rates. Restrictive monetary policy lowers inflation by removing excess aggregate demand. This leads to some economic slowdown in the short term, but in the medium and long term society as a whole benefits when inflation eases. Price stability is a precondition for sustainable growth.  How long are we going to be in restrictive territory, with monetary policy cooling the economy?  In line with the elements of our reaction function that I already mentioned, we will see how restrictive we need to be, and for how long, in order to achieve our inflation target. If – and this is a big “if” – the baseline scenario we discussed at our last meeting persists, there will still be more ground to cover and we will have to raise interest rates further. Those grounds to cover would not only depend on how market tensions evolve but also on underlying inflation convincingly turning the corner. But there is certainly additional uncertainty, so we cannot say with any precision how monetary policy will evolve from here.  In Spain, mortgage payments have risen quickly, but the same hasn’t happened with the remuneration of deposits. What would you say to the banks?  That is between the banks and their customers. Let me just say that, economically, it makes sense that when interest rates go up, the remuneration of deposits also ends up rising. This is part of monetary policy transmission. There can be lags, especially when there is still a lot of liquidity in the system, but it’s a logical consequence of raising rates.  Unidas Podemos – the smaller party in Spain’s coalition government – has suggested capping mortgage payments. Do you think that’s possible?  It’s not for me to comment on proposals from political parties. In general, while we understand why governments are implementing various measures, it’s important that these measures are temporary, targeted at those who really need them most, and tailored to the specific context. We have analysed all the government support measures across the euro area, and only 10% are targeted at low-income households. There are two important points here. First, you have to ensure that government finances remain sustainable. Second, the measures must be temporary and targeted because they could generate more inflationary pressures if these conditions aren’t met. And that would mean we would have to do more to fulfil our price stability objective.  Is it time for these measures to be withdrawn?  As energy prices come down, it’s important that European governments withdraw measures where possible.  This month you have also started shrinking your balance sheet – at a pace of €15 billion per month until June. Might you slow down, given the financial tensions?   Interest rates are currently the main instrument we adjust in the pursuit of our price stability mandate, guided by our reaction function. Complementing that, we will continue to shrink our bond portfolio in a balanced manner.   Spreads have remained under control so far. Do you anticipate the current turbulence starting to affect the debt of the peripheral countries, like Spain and Italy?  We are not seeing any movements in the bond markets that give us cause for concern. If there are tensions in the future, we have all our instruments at our disposal. This includes the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), which would allow us to counter the risks of fragmentation that could threaten the transmission of our monetary policy to all euro area countries.  Has using the TPI been discussed in any meetings?  That hasn’t been necessary. But we have the necessary elements in place to ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy.  The energy crisis has highlighted the need to speed up the energy transition. How can a central bank contribute to this objective?  We have actually just disclosed the carbon footprint of the ECB’s balance sheet and of the Eurosystem’s corporate sector holdings, which we are gradually decarbonising on a path that is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We have also taken measures relating to our collateral framework and to our risk assessment and management tools. Additionally, our objective as banking supervisors is to ensure that banks manage all their climate-related and environmental risks effectively, and for them to be resilient in an economy that needs to pick up the pace towards net zero emissions. To achieve this, we have set out a multi-year plan to ensure that the banks meet our expectations. And we have committed to doing more, if necessary and within our mandate, to ensure we continue to support the goals of the Paris Agreement.   "
2023-03-29,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Die Zeit,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted on 22 March by Kolja Rudzio","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Die Zeit   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted on 22 March by Kolja Rudzio 29 March 2023  In recent weeks, banks have collapsed in the US and Switzerland. Could the same happen in the eurozone?  Let me first strongly emphasise that what we’re seeing in the euro area in terms of tensions is a spillover from the US and from Switzerland. And please remember that we had a severe banking crisis in the European Union 15 years ago. As a result of that, we now have very tight regulation and very tight supervision of the banks. So our baseline is that the European banking system has a lot of capital and banks have been prudent in their lending decisions.   “Baseline” means you think this is the most likely scenario.  Yes. Of course we’re closely monitoring developments and are on our guard, but we don’t expect to see the same situation as in the US or in Switzerland to be the most likely scenario here in the euro area.  You don’t expect it, but you can’t rule it out, can you?  The history of banking teaches us that it’s very important to maintain confidence. We don’t have any reason to believe that a major problem would emerge. However, if it did, the ECB is able to respond. We have many tools, we can provide liquidity, and we can make sure we don’t see the types of bank runs that were evident in these examples.  If banks had to be rescued in the EU, would taxpayers have to pay for it again?   Here in the European Union and in the euro area, one of the most important lessons was to make sure the banks have a lot of capital, so that they are very capable of absorbing losses. The European banking system is well capitalised and profitable. And the macroeconomic outlook is positive. These are not the circumstances in which, in the baseline, we expect to see the banking system come under significant pressure.  At a recent conference, you called the financial turmoil we just saw a “non-event”. Could you explain that?   We’ve seen significant issues in the US and in Switzerland. But in the end, only certain types of banks with very specific problems were involved. We don’t see that as a general issue in the banking system. Of course people ask questions immediately after a policy intervention such as in the US or Switzerland. But I think it remains the case that there’s no direct read-across to the euro area. In the baseline, we expect these tensions will settle down.  That means a non-event?   Yes, from a macroeconomic perspective. The next level up from a non-event is if the banks become risk-averse because of a loss of confidence. Then there would be some impact on the economy, but it would still be limited.  Are you seeing that already?  It’s too early to tell, but this is something we’ll be looking at in the coming weeks. The third scenario is if it becomes more severe. But in our jargon, it’s a “tail event”. It is at the far end of the probability distribution – very unlikely. So we’re monitoring, but it’s still too early to extrapolate that this is going to be a significant issue.  Were you surprised by the banking problems we just witnessed?  For many years, the European Central Bank and other institutions have run projects playing through what happens if interest rates go up suddenly. I, by the way, participated in one of these projects around 2015. What stress such rate rises might put on the financial system is something we’ve studied for years. The exact details of which particular bank, what particular scenario, of course, always contains an element of surprise.  But was the high pace of the rate hikes you decided upon at the ECB perhaps a surprise for people?  I don’t think it really has been something that’s so sudden or severe. Let me make a number of observations here. Number one is: behind the increase in interest rates is the fact that inflation rose quite quickly. In the context of inflation rising that quickly, it would have been a surprise if interest rates did not also go up relatively quickly. Number two: these increases were from super-low levels. It should not be surprising to anyone that rates went from -0.5 per cent to, let’s say, about 2 per cent. That essentially was normalising policy. That was always expected, even if there was the question of the timing of it. Now,  because of high inflation, we needed to do more.  This is why we’ve brought rates above their long-run value of about 2 per cent, now to 3 per cent, and we’ve signalled they will go higher, if needed. The third point is we started really around December 2021, so already 16 months ago. First of all, we ended the pandemic emergency purchase programme, then we ended Quantitative Easing in general in June last year, then we moved rates out of negative in July. But already from January onwards, the market understood that rate hikes were coming. So we have always gone step-by-step, in part to allow the financial system to adjust.   Are these tensions in the financial system the downside of the zero interest rate policy which central banks have been pursuing for so many years?   I don't think that diagnosis is correct. The origin of the low interest rates was inflation that was too low, and the origin of the rising interest rates now is that inflation is too high. So I think what you described there is essentially a reflection of the actual issue, that inflation rose quickly. And it is clear as daylight that high inflation emerged because of the pandemic and because of the war in Ukraine. Of course, it is our job here at the ECB to make sure now that inflation comes down quickly to 2 per cent.  Inflation rose in 2021 and reached 5.1 per cent in January 2022 – before the war. So isn’t this development at least partly due to monetary policy?   No. Between summer 2021 and February 2022, when the invasion started, we had very strong goods inflation because of the pandemic and supply bottlenecks. Second, the European economy had just reopened after all the lockdowns. People were keen to go on holiday or were more relaxed about going to a restaurant and spending their money. Third, Russia had restricted energy supplies even before the invasion began. So we had three factors driving inflation at the beginning of 2022: bottlenecks, the war and energy prices, and the reopening of Europe. The inflation we’re seeing stemmed from these unusual factors. Finding the solution to that inflation, that’s our job.  You don’t see any misjudgement of the inflation by the ECB at that time?   Given the information we had at the time, I think we made reasonable choices. What is essential is that, if you see the world changing, you respond. We reduced the amount of money we put into the economy by buying bonds – from over one trillion euro in 2021 to net zero by June 2022. That was a huge turnaround. And many people predicted we would be reluctant to raise interest rates.  Weren’t you too reluctant? You only started raising interest rates in July.  Our priority in the first half of 2022 was to end this large bond-purchasing programme and start hiking rates afterwards. And the markets understood early on that we would raise our rates. For example, mortgage rates here in Germany also started to rise well before we began lifting our ECB rates. Thus the tightening has effectively been there since the end of 2021.  Let’s look forward. You predict that the inflation rate will go down rapidly from 10 per cent at the end of last year to 2.8 per cent at the end of this year and then further towards the inflation target of 2 per cent. Why you are so optimistic?  It’s a mix of factors. Energy prices are falling. Food prices are still very high and that is what people see when they go to the supermarket. But if you look at the earlier stages of production, at the farmgate prices, at the prices of the food ingredients, you will recognise: all of these have turned around. And history tells us that this will eventually lead to lower retail prices. Another factor: we have fewer supply bottlenecks. Car firms, for example, are able to get their microchips again. Therefore, the prices of goods should stabilise. Wages will rise on the other hand, but our overall assessment is a rapid decline of inflation at the end of this year.  Joachim Nagel, the president of the Bundesbank, warned recently that “price pressures are strong and broad-based across the economy”. How does that fit with your rosy outlook?  I agree with that statement. Our President, Christine Lagarde, said something similar. We are in fact probably in the most intense phase of inflation. It takes some time until the dynamics which I described reach the customer. Let’s say you’re a producer. You paid a high price last year for your inventory. When you sell these goods now, you’ll probably seek a correspondingly high price, even if your input purchase prices are already declining. So right now we still have this intense inflation pressure. Although, when you look further ahead, you see the improvement, gradual in spring and summer, but quite a bit in autumn.  Does this mean there is no need for more rate hikes?  Under our baseline scenario, in order to make sure inflation comes down to 2 per cent, more hikes will be needed. That is absolutely our diagnosis. If the financial stress we see is non-zero, but turns out to be still fairly limited, interest rates will still need to go up. However, if the financial stress we talked about becomes stronger, then we’ll have to see what’s appropriate.   So there is a trade-off between fighting inflation and stabilising banks?  No. If this financial stress weakens the economy, it would automatically reduce the inflationary pressures.  You mentioned rising wages. Do you see any sign of a wage-price spiral which could fuel inflation?  So far, rising wages have not been an important source of inflation. Last year a lot of the price increases could be put down to increased profits and rising energy costs. This year we think there’s a handover. We expect wages to go up more quickly as unions react to the high inflation of last year. But it’s very important for everyone – workers, firms – to recognise that inflation will be much closer to 2 per cent next year and in 2025. The wage-price spiral is a scenario which happened in the 1970s when expectations became entrenched that inflation would be high every year. This is not what we’re seeing. We’re seeing wage increases that are higher than normal, but in the grand scheme of things they look reasonably fair. But we have to keep an eye on this.  In Germany unions are demanding a pay rise of 10.5 per cent for the public sector. Could this trigger more inflation?  I’m not going to comment on any one particular set of negotiations. What I would say is, sometimes I read headlines of very high wage increases. But when you look at the details, there is often a one-off payment, which doesn’t increase labour costs permanently. Or the wage increase might be spread over 18 or 24 months. So the true increase per year is lower.   At what percentage does a wage increase start to get dangerous in terms of inflation?  Let me cite what we have in our forecast. Remember, under this forecast, inflation is coming down to 2.8 per cent at the end of this year and then continuing to improve towards our goal of 2 per cent. We assume wage growth of 5.3 per cent this year and 4.4 per cent next year. We’re putting a lot of effort into tracking wage settlements week-by-week, and so if we saw them coming in above that, then we would start to become more concerned.   ECB President Christine Lagarde said there should be a fair burden-sharing between employees and companies in this time of high inflation. What does that mean?  The spectacular rise in energy import prices was the trigger for high inflation. We’re paying more for imports of oil and gas from other countries now. Which means that there is less income to be distributed in our economy. There is a collective loss. And the question is: how much should the workers’ earnings go down and how much the profits of firms? The loss has to be absorbed somehow if we want the EU to remain competitive and to do well in global business.    Is the burden-sharing fair at the moment?  Well, profits did better than wages last year for a number of reasons. One reason, for example, is that wage negotiations take time. This year we expect wages to increase more. And we believe that firms will have less space to increase their profits through higher prices. For many reasons: demand should cool off and the supply bottlenecks should ease, for example. So the share of the burden changes over time.   But in general your outlook seems quite optimistic. You expect inflation to fall quickly while the economy grows. Does it mean we’re going to achieve a so-called “soft landing”?  It is possible. Some might object that it takes a recession to bring down inflation. But we have a very unusual situation. We’re coming out of a pandemic and out of a very severe energy crisis. We’ve lost so much growth momentum in the pandemic that it’s possible for the pandemic recovery to continue and for inflation to come down simultaneously.   "
2023-03-26,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Business Post ,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Daniel Murray ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Business Post    Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Daniel Murray  26 March 2023  Have you come to expect crisis and are you comfortable managing crisis?  The situation is quite different to the one we had in 2008/09. First, banks have much better capital and liquidity positions, well above minimum requirements, their situation is overall more solid, also on account of more demanding regulation. Secondly, looking at the macroeconomic situation, there are no problems with respect to the competitiveness of European economies. For example, the balance of payments in Spain, Greece, Ireland, or Portugal are in a much better position. And finally, the economic policy approach is different in comparison with 2010, 2011 and 2012. We have had four years of looser fiscal rules. That was the correct response to the crisis during the pandemic. It was a sort of whatever it takes in fiscal policy while monetary policy was very supportive too. We have other difficulties now, but these can be addressed more easily than during the great financial crisis.  Are you more optimistic about Europe’s economic outlook than you were in the latter half of last year?  Our projections in December had included a technical recession, with two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But that’s no longer our baseline. Similarly, new indicators and data on headline inflation had been quite positive since October. The projections released last week were more optimistic on growth and inflation. Nevertheless, growth numbers weren’t great, hovering around 1 per cent, while inflation was clearly more positive, especially headline inflation.  The question now is how the events in the US banking system and Credit Suisse will impact the euro area economy. Over the next weeks and months, we need to assess whether they will give rise to an additional tightening of financing conditions.   So you are more optimistic about the inflationary environment, but things have changed with regards to financial stability?   These kinds of events increase uncertainty, and we must take that into consideration. Our impression is that they will lead to an additional tightening of credit standards in the euro area. And perhaps this will feed through to the economy in terms of lower growth and lower inflation. But we have to assess the intensity of this factor. It is still too early to say now.   The ECB’s goal is to get inflation to 2 per cent. Do you have a time period within which you want to see that realistically happen?  We want a timely return to 2 per cent inflation. We know it cannot be tomorrow, but it has to be within our projection horizon, which is a period of two years. But the trajectory of inflation is much more important than just touching the 2 per cent target. Headline inflation will decline quite rapidly over the next six to seven months as the base effects play in favour of a rapid reduction in inflation. What we want to see is a steady and clear convergence towards the 2 per cent target. In that respect, core inflation is going to be key. It is very difficult to converge towards the 2 per cent target in a sustainable way without a clear decline in core inflation.   If headline inflation is projected to fall, do you have more confidence in the energy market and energy prices in Europe even by next winter?  Falling energy prices will play a very important role, supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away, and our monetary policy decisions, with a certain lag, have started to have an impact. Our bank lending survey already shows a tightening of financing conditions. So those are the three elements that will help reduce headline inflation.  However, there are other aspects that will be less positive. The first is the evolution of wages: wage increases are accelerating. We look at this carefully because it has an impact mainly on services prices. The second aspect is fiscal policy and how fiscal support measures evolve over time. These measures may be positive and reduce inflation in the short-term, but once they start being withdrawn in 2024, the opposite effect can be expected. And finally, China’s reopening. This is positive for growth, but, as we have seen recently, it can add to price pressures, mainly for raw materials and commodities.  All in all, I am positive about the decline of headline inflation, but we need to look very carefully at the evolution of core inflation. There will be a disinflationary process over the coming months. But to reach our target core inflation must also start to decelerate too.   So what tools should be used to address core inflation?  Monetary policy has a role to play, as does fiscal policy, which has to be temporary, targeted and selective. Simultaneously, wage moderation is needed, and in that respect fiscal policy can help.   Is there a ceiling in how high the ECB can raise interest rates, and have you stress tested what would happen to bank balance sheets in the event of a 4-6 per cent rate?  We raised rates by 50 basis points in March and we are open-minded with respect to the future. We are data dependent. There is now this additional element of uncertainty stemming from the financial sector problems in the United States and in Switzerland.  And we will take a meeting-by-meeting approach. We are not pre- committing to any action.   Regarding stress testing, the 2023 exercise led by the European Banking Authority was already in the pipeline, and the results will be published in July. But overall the situation in the euro area banking system is much better than it was a decade ago in terms of liquidity, capital, and supervision. Therefore, we believe the sector as a whole is resilient, sound, and safe. But we shouldn’t be complacent.   Governments have intervened with large subsidy programmes to alleviate the effects of inflation. Is there a risk these are keeping inflation higher for longer, and what approach should be taken to winding them down?   Fiscal support measures must be temporary, selective, and targeted to vulnerable groups in the society. The ECB and European Commission’s approach is that across-the-board subsidies for everyone are not very helpful. They would ultimately be an impediment to the green transition, for example, because prices must reflect the reality of the marketplace. Across-the-board subsidies create opacity about the right incentives and price signals to reduce demand.    Energy prices are declining everywhere. Thus, subsidies should adjust to this decline. Government should not use the pretext that was set when energy prices were very high to maintain these subsidies in the future. That wouldn’t make any economic sense.   Is the significant level of public debt an emerging risk for financial stability, especially considering that governments are expected to need larger spending programmes to deal with the likes of the climate crisis?  Public debt ratios in Europe have risen quite a lot since the pandemic. That was the correct fiscal policy response to the pandemic, but now we have higher public debt ratios and higher structural public deficits. So, we have to look at this very carefully. The European Commission’s approach to deactivate the ”escape clause” [from fiscal rules] in 2024 is the right one. The EU’s fiscal rules are under discussion, but the EU Commission has just given guidance to governments for 2024 budgetary policy. That was especially  needed because the interest rate situation and the cost of funding for governments is not the same as was three years ago.   Will that impact on the ability of governments to spend on addressing the climate crisis?  There are new priorities in the European Union, such as defence expenditures that will rise due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and we need to spend on the digital and green transitions. These will require a lot of public investment. But we also have the NextGeneration EU funds which will be a very important helping hand for many countries.   How concerned are you by what happened at Credit Suisse in the last two weeks and the banking issues in the United States as well?   The situation in the United States created a lot of uncertainty in terms of confidence in the financial system and that had an impact on Credit Suisse. But the situations are very different. In the case of the US, Silicon Valley Bank had quite a unique business model. The lending and deposit-base was very much concentrated on tech companies and due to the duration mismatch between its assets and liabilities, it was extremely exposed to interest rate risk.  The solution for Credit Suisse was rapid and that’s good. In the euro area, we clarified that the seniority order followed in this case in terms of loss absorption would not be possible. We will respect the order established by the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive. Common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses, and only after their full use would Additional Tier 1 instruments be required to be written down.  Was the Swiss approach to imposing losses on bondholders first a risky one and could there be consequences for euro area banks?   We have not seen a lot of contagion. It is clear that our pecking order is equity first and only then junior debt. We clarified this and that has reduced any potential uncertainty that the decision by the Swiss authorities could have created.   What does the ECB stand ready to do if there is contagion across European banks?   Financial stability is essential and we’re closely monitoring it. Liquidity instruments in our toolbox are ready to be used again. The toolkit is available should it become necessary.   Does the Credit Suisse situation look like an isolated case, or has it highlighted new systemic weaknesses? Is it different to the last financial crash?   In the case of Credit Suisse and the US banks, there were specific and idiosyncratic factors.  Our main concern in terms of financial stability is the situation of the non-banks. This has been the case for some years, and it is the soft spot in the financial system. At system level, the banking sector in Europe is sound and resilient. But the non-banks have been growing as share of the financial system in Europe, and they took a lot of risks during the times of very low-interest rates. These are risks in terms of liquidity, duration, credit, and leverage. Thus, when monetary policy changes, these potential vulnerabilities can come to the surface.   Are you happy with the availability of data on the non-bank sector to assess those vulnerabilities?  We are not the supervisors of non-banks. But non-banks are interconnected with the traditional banks we supervise, and that’s why we also look into this sector. We cooperate in international fora such as the Financial Stability Board, the IMF, the G20, ESRB and ESMA aiming to improve the macroprudential toolkit for non-banks. We do believe it could be a source of problems for the whole financial system, and we need to be careful.  Having steered Spain through its financial crash and recovery, how have you viewed Ireland’s recovery and the abnormal growth of our economy due to the multinational presence here?   The problems of Ireland in 2010 were quite similar to the Spanish ones. The problems were created because of a real estate bubble, and the bursting of that bubble gave rise to serious problems which meant the governments had to help banks. At the end of the day, both programmes were quite successful. Ireland cleaned up the banks and improved governance, and the Irish economy has been outperforming European peers since 2013. The case of Spain is quite similar. The lesson is that once you clean up the banking industry, economies improved too.  In Ireland the presence of multinationals is a particular characteristic. In Spain, the tourist sector is very large and important for the economy. With a bit of perspective, the consequences of the programmes for both countries were positive and the kind of problems they had a decade ago are not there now.   The significant presence of multinationals in Ireland distorts our own economy and even the wider EU economy. Is that an issue for the ECB in properly assessing economic trends or risks?  I don’t think it is a problem. We know the very idiosyncratic characteristics of Ireland in terms of the difference between GDP and GNP. We understand why and it is taken into consideration.   Ireland has seen an exit of domestic banks in recent years, and we are now down to two main pillar banks. Is this a concern in terms of financial stability?   That is more an issue for competition authorities, but I can tell you about my Spanish experience which could perhaps be applied to Ireland. Competition is not necessarily determined by the number of players in a market. Because if you have for instance numerous players which are not very active or are weak, then that competition isn’t real.   Should banks increase remuneration of depositors?   Remuneration of deposits should go in parallel with rate rises on the assets side of the banks. Rates should go up not only for credits but also for deposits. This is something we are looking at very carefully.   So are we now moving into an extended period of high interest rates?     My personal view is that the period of negative interest rates is over, at least in the medium term. We are going through a period of very high uncertainty.   "
2023-03-05,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Grupo Vocento,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Adolfo Lorente, from El Correo","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Grupo Vocento   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Adolfo Lorente, from El Correo 5 March 2023  Will you raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at your March meeting?  It is very likely that we will raise interest rates by 50 basis points. This was a decision that was indicated at our last monetary policy meeting and all the numbers we have been seeing in recent days are confirming that this interest rate hike is very, very likely.  Inflation, especially underlying inflation, is still very high. Are the ECB’s measures not producing the results that you expected?  First, I would point out that headline inflation has gone down in recent months, and will continue to decline in the next few months. Core inflation, which in the euro area excludes energy and food, is too high. In Spain, where this indicator also includes processed food, it stands at 7.7%. The way forward is clear: we have to continue to take the measures needed to bring inflation back to 2%. And we will do so.  What is the time frame for deciding whether you will change pace and moderate the rate hikes? Perhaps at the meeting before the summer? Or at the end of this year?  We are data dependent. Many governors are making suggestions or predictions and giving their opinion and personal analysis. As President of the ECB I have to be focused on the decision-making, which needs to take into account the data. These include our macroeconomic projections, the latest figures and the impact of our measures over time. And, of course, the views of all the governors in the Governing Council. What I am certain about is that we will return to our 2% target in a timely manner and that we will be resolute and determined in doing so.  Many experts are already talking about interest rates rising to 4% and they are not even ruling out further rate hikes in 2024. What is your ceiling? Have you set a limit?  The ECB doesn’t have a ceiling, but an inflation target of 2%. That is the medium-term inflation target, which is how price stability is defined for us. As I said, I cannot tell you how high rates will go. I know that they will be higher than they are now and we still have more work to do because we cannot declare victory. We are making progress, but we still have work to do.  Governments are warning that further rate hikes may greatly complicate the recovery. Are you worried about this?  My main concern is inflation. We don’t want to break the economy; that’s not our goal. Our goal is to tame inflation. And as a central bank, interest rate hikes are our main tool to achieve that. Raising interest rates dampens demand and reduces inflationary pressures. For the moment, the economy is resilient, employment is robust and unemployment is the lowest it has ever been.   Families are suffering a lot from inflation. They are suffering through their electricity bills and the cost of their weekly shopping. Should governments act by giving more public aid or lowering taxes?   I know that people are suffering from inflation, particularly the most vulnerable and those who are most exposed, pensioners with low incomes. At the ECB we believe that government support should be targeted at those vulnerable people. And that it should be temporary. When the situation improves, when energy prices go down and when food prices stabilise, governments should then be in a position to withdraw the support. And the measures should be tailored so that they encourage people to save energy rather than use it as if it cost nothing.  What is your message for the millions of Spanish families that have variable rate mortgage loans and are suffering from higher interest rates?  Variable rate loans are a double-edged sword. When interest rates are very low, people benefit from reduced payments. But when rates rise, as they have had to in order to tame inflation, monthly payments increase.  I’m sure many banks are ready to negotiate in order to ease the burden on households over time. It is in the banks’ interest to do so, because they know that when inflation is under control, interest rates will ultimately go down. And they don’t want non-performing loans on their balance sheets.  In Spain, the minority party in the [coalition] government is calling for a cap [on the rates] on variable loans to mitigate the increases. Do you think this measure is feasible?   This is determined by the relationship between borrowers and lenders.  I’m sure many banks are prepared to reconsider loan conditions and prepared to spread repayments over time. And not out of charity. Don’t get me wrong. The banks have their legitimate business and are part of the solution. It is in their interest to avoid non-performing loans and to have borrowers with good credit.  The banks are making billions thanks to the rate hikes. But in Spain, for example, they are still not remunerating customer deposits. Do you think they should?     Again, we are talking about the relationship between a bank and its customers. When interest rates increase, when the cost of borrowing rises, clearly remuneration on deposits is up for discussion and can be increased.   The latest macroeconomic forecasts by institutions such as the European Commission are more optimistic than expected. Do you share this optimism?  We will publish our own projections in two weeks’ time, so I will tell you then. But I am confident that headline inflation will go down in 2023, while core inflation will be stickier in the near term. And I expect somewhat better economic growth compared with the stagnation in the last quarter of 2022. But we’ll update the projections in two weeks, and we’ll publish the numbers then.   Nevertheless, the geopolitical situation is extremely complicated, especially as a result of the war in Ukraine. Is there a real risk of recession, or has that already gone away?   The projections by ECB staff do not include a recession in 2023. We anticipate positive growth and increased activity over the course of the year. But it’s true there is huge uncertainty. A little more than a year ago, we could never have imagined that there would be a war right on Europe’s doorstep. What will happen over the coming months is uncertain.  In recent years, countries like Spain have been heavily reliant on the ECB’s monetary stimulus and zero interest rate policy. Is our country prepared for this new scenario?  Looking at the economic figures for Spain, they are quite robust. Take GDP, for example. It is better than in many other Member States. Inflation, too, is better than in other Member States. It’s true, however, that the unemployment figures, at almost 13%, are not as good as the euro area average, which stands at 6.7%. Now, of course, public spending has to be kept under control and appropriate measures need to be taken that are targeted, temporary and tailored in order not to squander public spending and to tailor it properly so that it doesn’t fuel demand excessively.  Are you worried that risk premium problems might rear their head again?  We are keeping a very close eye on this. Currently, we are not seeing any abrupt movements or fears that may give rise to an unwarranted increase in the risk premium. We are very vigilant and I think we have the necessary tools to address these risks should they arise. And, if need be, we will use those tools.   Public spending has skyrocketed to deal with the crisis. Aren’t you afraid that debt might be the next big crisis?  Public debt has increased globally. I’m thinking about low-income countries in particular. What we are seeing in advanced economies – and this is the case in Europe and Spain – is that public debt was high to begin with and increased quite a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to keep the economy afloat. This was the right policy response at that time. But now fiscal policy needs to adjust. And this adjustment needs to take place within a European framework and fiscal governance that will hopefully be decided soon.  The ECB continues to play a crucial role. Does the spirit of Mario Draghi’s famous statement to do “whatever it takes” delivered in London in 2012, which helped save the euro, live on?  Yes, undoubtedly. And we will do whatever is needed to return inflation to 2%. Mario was dealing with another situation and times were different, and that message was very much called for and had an immediate impact. I see our action as being more sustained because inflation is a monster that we need to knock on the head and keep at 2%.  Is it sustainable for a government to index pension increases to inflation and to do so by law?  Inflation indexation has not helped us in the past and has generally contributed to fuelling inflation that had got out of control. Our economies became hooked on it. I don’t think it would be a good idea to go back to that.  Do you think it’s time that employers and unions reached a wage agreement to deal with this situation?  Yes, absolutely. I think this would be the most intelligent thing to do.  This seems impossible in Spain...  You know, what seemed impossible two or three years ago is possible today. For example, we never thought that Europe would borrow jointly to create the Recovery and Resilience Facility to support those countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The issue we’re facing now is that we have inflation that is too high and interest rates that are being raised to keep it under control. This situation calls for adults in the room who can sit down and decide what is in the interest of all stakeholders, not just one versus the others, but all of them. So, I would hope that it’s possible.  Ten years on from the financial bailout, what is the state of the Spanish banking sector?  Spanish banks have consolidated considerably. They are much stronger and have higher capital ratios. They are a little below the euro area average but overall they are still much stronger than they were a few years ago.  Bankers’ high salaries are once again at the heart of the debate. Should they be lowered?   It’s not for the European Central Bank to make those decisions. But there is obviously a reputational side to those kinds of decisions that bank leaders should be aware of.   Spanish banks have strongly criticised the new exceptional temporary levy approved by the government. What do you think of this new levy?  The ECB was called upon to give an opinion, which is what we did. We raised several issues, particularly regarding the basis on which the levy would be established, the potential impact it would have on financial stability and on the robustness of banks. We published our opinion, so I don’t have anything else to add.  A few years ago there was a great deal of pressure on banks to consolidate at the European level. Do you think this should happen? And what about in Spain?  I think the main thing we have to do as a central bank is work with the European Commission to eliminate the hurdles that may be hampering the consolidation process. All of the constraints that prevent banks from creating synergies, becoming more competitive and providing better financing to firms and households should be eliminated. Our job is to help remove these obstacles. It is up to banks to decide how they want to organise their business. They are the ones who decide whether or not they want to merge.  What do you make of Ferrovial’s decision to move its head office to the Netherlands for legal certainty reasons?  I won’t make any assessment in this particular case. What I will say is that Europe really needs to make progress on completing the capital markets union. Although we share the same currency, European markets are fragmented, with different legal frameworks and different taxation rules. We need to streamline all of this to make it easier for European businesses to obtain financing and to grow. We are moving in the right direction, but more still needs to be done.

2023-03-01,Philip R. Lane,Interview with IMF Finance and Development magazine,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Nicholas Owen ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with IMF Finance and Development magazine   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Nicholas Owen  1 March 2023  The interview is an updated version of the conversation broadcast in the IMF podcast series on 17 November 2022.   After rising to highs not seen for 40 years, inflation in Europe is showing signs of slowing. How important is it to the euro area’s economic outlook that the authorities succeed in returning inflation expectations to 2 percent?   The worst-case scenario for a central bank is that a prolonged phase of high inflation causes the public to lose confidence that price stability (in practice, a 2 percent inflation target) will be maintained over the medium term. If the public comes to believe that inflation will remain high on an indefinite basis, this would be baked into price and wage setting and become self-sustaining. So it is essential that monetary policy is clearly set to make sure that inflation returns in a timely manner to our 2 percent target. This has been especially important over the last year, given that monetary policy had been previously geared for several years to address a persistent below-target inflation pattern. So we have been moving in a sustained manner away from a super-accommodative monetary stance toward a stance that is sufficiently restrictive to make sure inflation returns to target and thereby keeps longer-term inflation expectations anchored.   What lessons can policymakers learn from the inflation shock? Most economists expected price pressures to be only transitory. Do we need to do monetary policy differently?  This episode will no doubt be studied for many years to come, so my answer to this question is highly provisional. At the same time, I think it should be recognized that the twin forces of the pandemic and the war-related surge in energy prices constituted extraordinarily large and asymmetrical shocks that were bound to generate an initial phase of high inflation. It is certainly true that it warrants ongoing examination to assess whether the ECB and other central banks could have done a better job in assessing the size and duration of this inflation shock. We should always strive to learn from such episodes and be open to internal and external critiques. Over the last year, central banks have reversed out of quantitative easing programs and cumulatively raised interest rates quite a bit over a relatively short period. We will also learn a lot about the conduct of monetary policy and the effectiveness of monetary policy over the coming months.  Do you think ECB policies to shrink its balance sheet will pose problems for governments in the euro area with large financing requirements? Some heavily indebted governments have grown accustomed to selling bonds effortlessly to the ECB.  These programs have always had the primary focus on ensuring that the long end of the yield curve contributed to the monetary easing that the overall economy needed to avoid prolonged below-target inflation: these were not programs to directly finance governments. While it is too early to draw conclusive lessons from our experience in moving away from quantitative easing and now embarking on quantitative tightening, we have seen in recent months that the normalization of interest rates has meant that many institutional investors (both European and global) have high demand to purchase euro area government bonds.  In relation to fiscal policy, we are quite clear that, in line with the EU’s economic governance framework, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt.  Of course, there is an important role for fiscal policy to shield the most vulnerable in the economy from the energy price shock. There is not only a moral but also an economic imperative to that. But we are also emphatic that fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted, and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. In particular, as the energy crisis becomes less acute, it is important to now start rolling these measures back promptly in line with the fall in energy prices and in a concerted manner.  Rising interest rates are piling pressure on households across Europe. Do central banks have any role to play in lessening that pressure, or is it something that should be left entirely to governments and fiscal policy?   All households benefit from medium-term price stability. The poor are the hardest hit by persistent inflation. Accordingly, it is in our collective interest that the ECB maintains a primary focus on the timely return of inflation to our 2 percent target. We should be efficient in our monetary policy: delivering our target, while minimizing the costs in terms of output and employment. In analyzing the transmission of monetary policy, we closely examine the impact of interest rate movements on households: not only the direct effects—which, at any point in time, vary across borrowers and savers and across different age groups—but also the indirect effects through the impact of monetary policy on output and employment. These vary between those who work in the sectors most sensitive to interest rate movements (such as construction and consumer durables) and those who work in less cyclical industries. Governments should always protect the most vulnerable in society, but fiscal measures that directly offset the impact of interest rate movements can be problematic in terms of the efficiency of monetary policy and may be less effective than other income policies.

2023-02-28,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted on Friday, 24 February 2023 by Balázs Korányi and Frank Siebelt ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted on Friday, 24 February 2023 by Balázs Korányi and Frank Siebelt  28 February 2023  What is your assessment of economic developments since your last meeting or since the December projections?   Since the December meeting – that is the relevant timeline for us – we’ve experienced several favourable supply shocks. There’s been a strong decline in energy prices, particularly for gas. This is a partial reversal of the stagflationary shock we had last year. Such a supply shock is better for GDP and should also lower the inflation rate. So it’s a good news story.  Then we’ve seen confirmation that the bottlenecks continue to ease. That’s probably most visible in the rebound in car industry production in recent months. That’s significant for the European economy. The easing of bottlenecks is also good news for GDP and for pricing pressures.  On top of that, we have the reopening of China, which I interpret as a favourable supply shock, as Chinese firms are now back looking to compete on the global market. We also have fewer concerns about pandemic restrictions in China creating new bottlenecks. But of course there’s also an impact on the demand side, because China is set to grow quickly this year. This reopening will boost global demand for commodities and foreign demand for the euro area. Another favourable demand shock is the labour market. We continue to have good news about the labour markets. There are ongoing increases in employment and probably a reassessment in the direction that the risk of losing your job is going down.  Not disconnected from all of this, we’ve had confirmation that the fiscal support governments gave in the last months of last year helped many households preserve their income and consumption.  We’ve also had confirmation that our monetary policy is working. We’ve seen significant increases in the yield curve, significant increases in bank lending rates, declines in house prices in a number of countries and we see a tightening of credit conditions that we expect will lower credit volumes. This is of course just one stage of how monetary policy works. But I think there’s significant evidence that monetary policy is kicking in. Some of these factors are essentially near-term in nature. The improvement in the energy price situation will in the near term lower inflation and boost GDP. But if you look further, to 2024, to 2025, the tightening of monetary policy has been significantly more than what was baked into the December forecast and that has to be factored into the new forecasts.   Some of these factors are inflationary, particularly what you said about growth and the labour market. Once aggregated, do you expect your 2025 inflation projection to come down?   I will not pre-empt the aggregation work of the staff on the new projections. But the supply shocks, on net, lower inflationary pressures. With regard to the war against Ukraine, we should not interpret the situation simply as an energy crisis. The war will be a first-order, fundamental issue for Europe in the coming years. We saw last year an immediate and big drop in consumer and investor confidence. This was not just because people were facing higher energy prices. The war raised questions about lots of issues, about the future of trade, geopolitics and so on.  But the worst-case scenarios we faced around last September and October, where people feared outright rationing of energy, have not materialised. Consumer and investor confidence is an important demand-side issue, and we had a big slowdown last year. Growth ended up just marginally above zero in the fourth quarter and this outcome is a lot worse than we had in our projections at the start of 2022.  There was a lot of uncertainty in the autumn about what would happen when the crude oil sanction kicks in or what would happen when the refined oil sanctions kick in. But there’s been a lot of substitution by European firms, governments and households. There’s been a lot of resilience, and I think that’s very reassuring.  There’s also going to be significant volumes of new information coming in after March. In April, we’ll have the stability programme updates from governments. We emphasised in December the crucial role for fiscal policy with regard to how much overall demand expansion they’re providing, specifically on energy prices and the design of different subsidies.  Clearly, with the turnaround in the wholesale markets, many governments do have to think again and make sure that their measures are tailored and targeting those who are most vulnerable. With the stability programme updates, we’ll see more about how governments plan to respond in 2024. For our medium-term perspective, these fiscal policies will be very important.  In April, we’ll have another round of the ECB’s bank lending survey. The last one showed that quite a lot of tightening is in the pipeline. Banks are also reassessing their lending. Maybe the brighter GDP outlook causes them to reassess their attitude to credit. But then there’s the issue of the ongoing increase in funding costs, the declines in housing prices and so on. The first-quarter GDP will also be an important data point for us. It’s interesting to think about the March forecast but we are entering a fairly long phase of very rich data flows, which will help us reach firmer conclusions on many of these points.  Do you see any reason not to go through with the 50 basis point rate increase in March? Could you also run us through your criteria for ending rate hikes?  Our assessment of December remains solid, that we needed a sequence of 50 basis point hikes to bring us inside a zone where we would need to think harder about whether rates are sufficiently restrictive to deliver the return of inflation to 2%. The data flow since then suggests that the assessment is solid, that we need another 50 basis points in March.  Then there are three criteria for what happens after that.  One element is our inflation projections, and here I mean the whole path, not just the end point. The second is progress in relation to underlying inflation, and the third is an assessment on how powerfully and how quickly monetary tightening is working. With regard to the forecast, it’s about the cumulative deviation from the target. Any deviation from the target is costly in terms of delivering on our mandate.  So the larger and the longer the material deviation from 2% is, that is significant, in addition to the forecasted speed of convergence to our target.  On underlying inflation, we also need to look at actual outcomes, because forecasting techniques are limited, which is even more true now, given the volatility and the shocks we’ve seen. So we’re all signed up to the criterion that sufficient progress in underlying inflation is important. The issue is how to interpret that criterion. Typically, step one in assessing inflation is to take out energy and food, because these are usually more volatile. That said, we cannot forget about energy and food entirely because these are fundamental to the cost of living. The higher headline inflation is, the more pressure there will be on the cost of living, on wage inflation and other elements which go into core inflation, since underlying inflation is heavily influenced by headline inflation.  Food inflation is very significant. Food has twice the weight of energy in the overall index. As for core inflation, it’s difficult to overstate the importance of recognising that the drivers of goods inflation and services inflation are quite different. Looking at core inflation as an aggregate is not super helpful and I think we need to look at the dynamics of goods inflation and services inflation in a more granular way.  For energy, food and goods, there’s a lot of forward-looking indicators saying that inflation pressures in all of those categories should come down quite a bit. The reason I say that is because there’s a wholesale level of pricing and there’s an intermediate-level pricing, and price pressures at these earlier stages are turning around.  Actual goods retail prices are still very strong, but the intermediate stage has been a good predictor of price pressures. The fact that these are turning around, including through the easing of bottlenecks and global factors, suggest that there will be significant reductions in inflation rates for energy, food and goods.  The services sector is what we need to watch in particular. There are two big questions about services inflation. One is the interconnection with wage inflation, because a lot of service sectors are quite labour-intensive. The second issue, which cuts across a lot of service sectors, including contact-intensive and energy-intensive sectors, is that these had a lot of unusual pricing last year.  Transportation, hotels and restaurants suffered a big cost shock from energy price increases. The contact-intensive sectors also had a reopening effect last year. There was a very strong demand for tourism with big price increases for transportation, travel, hotels and restaurants. That created a mismatch in sectors, which in the short term had little scope to improve their supply capacity.  One year later, we can expect airlines to better plan capacity and hotels to plan more recruitment for the summer.  So the supply-side component of services inflation should ease. But we very much have to maintain our focus on wages, which are now rising across Europe. So the sectors I mentioned may be simultaneously facing a better supply capacity, normalisation of demand and rising labour costs. The net effect on pricing is going to be a very data-dependent issue.   Corporate margins rose very sharply last year. How can a central bank deal with inflation fuelled more by profitability than wages?   We fully recognise this and this is an important point. The economics of profitability suggest we might see more of a profit squeeze coming up. The tightening of monetary policy works by dampening demand. The fiscal stance is also going to be a significant factor for overall demand in the euro area. European firms in many sectors are selling globally, and that’s where the re-entry of competition from Chinese firms could be relevant. In euro area manufacturing, pricing decisions have been heavily influenced by the pricing decisions of their competitors around the world. And goods inflation in the United States is off quite a bit. European firms know that if they raise prices too much, they will suffer a loss in market share.  Last year there was a perfect storm of pricing pressures and pricing opportunities. I expect that to be a lot less this year.  On the cost side, there are going to be higher labour costs. But firms in many sectors raised prices by a lot more last year than their increase in costs. So there is plausibly room for unit profits to fall in a number of sectors. There is also room for core inflation to fall if unit profits normalise in those sectors. For us, it’s not just about the latest number – we need to separate the persistent factors from the factors which may fade. There’s a lot of forward-looking indicators which suggest that inflation is going to fall. But right now, there is still momentum from last year.  There are open questions on services. Is it the case that these extraordinary unit profits have room to narrow because of an extra year of adjustment to the reopening, the dampening of demand and the scale of momentum in wage inflation? Interest rates are most effective when they are set in a durable fashion. Wherever interest rates settle down, we basically need to balance the incoming hard data, but also our forecasts, our future data.  Let’s say inflation starts to fall in line with the forecast. If we settle into our durable plateau of interest rates, it will not be the case that in the first month of a significant fall in core inflation we would need to immediately start revising our plan.  Staying the course has two components. One is to bring rates to the levels that are needed, with a durable approach towards that level. We also need to make sure we do not start the phase of bringing rates back down to their long-run steady state until we have a high degree of confidence that the target is secure.   Core inflation may fall below the headline rate this year. What is the policy implication of this?   We should have a strong focus on underlying inflation dynamics, which is not the same concept as core inflation. We should also recognise that underlying and headline inflation are not independent. If there is a big decline in headline inflation, that will reduce pressures for wage increases, because the number one theme in wage bargaining right now is compensating workers for the high inflation that has already happened.  If headline inflation is coming down, that improvement, or less bad news about the cost of living, will lower pressure for high wage increases going into 2024. This is fundamental, and I don’t think there’s a contest between underlying inflation and headline inflation.   Where do rate hikes end, and is it clear to you, like many of your colleagues say, that more hikes are needed beyond March?  All those comments and market pricing are scenarios. If it is deemed that the inflation forecast hasn’t improved enough or we’re not seeing sufficient progress in underlying inflation, or we think the monetary transmission mechanism is working too slowly, then you can say with a set of conditional statements that a higher rate will be desirable.  But this is why we said in our last meeting that we intend to bring in another 50 basis point hike in March and then we will evaluate the post-March policy path.  The overall philosophy is that we will bring rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive, which depends on where the inflation forecast is, where we are with underlying inflation and where we are with the monetary transmission mechanism.  So I don’t think it’s a good idea to focus on a dot plot.    There is a zone of interest rate paths that the Governing Council will have to assess in March, in May and thereafter, and determine where in that zone we want to be.  Are we already in restrictive territory?   When raising interest rates, there isn’t an instant reaction from the whole economy. Let’s take 2023: some people in the past six or seven weeks may have seen their previous fixed rate mortgages expire and now face a higher rate. Some people may be thinking about renovating their home or buying a car. Those people are being hit right now by the change in the interest rate environment. Every month, every quarter, more and more people will be exposed to the new interest rate environment, and thus the impact of monetary policy accumulates. So far only a minority of firms and households have been fully exposed to the rate increases. This is why the second half of this year will be very important, because it will be a full year since we started hiking. We expect to get our policy rate to 3% in March, and according to a wide range of ways of thinking about it, that’s a restrictive level.  There is a universal conviction that when inflation is stabilised at 2%, we are not going back to the pre-pandemic scenario of super low level of interest rates and quantitative easing. So there’s a permanent component in the shift of the monetary regime. In various surveys and data, investors predict that the policy rate will settle down in the neighbourhood of 2%. Once we’re back at target, then compared to our earlier policy rate of -0.5%, 250 basis points of our rate increases will essentially be permanent.  On this basis, according to this market assessment, anything above 2% is viewed as temporary and in that sense restrictive, because it’s not a permanent increase. It could be quite a long-lasting period, a fair number of quarters, but not forever.  Another area which may operate more quickly is asset pricing, including house prices and the evaluation of investment projects. It’s straightforward for residential real estate and commercial real estate. But it’s also significant for those sectors where the whole economic model has been to rely on losses now and profits in the distant future, with the discounted present value of future earnings lower as a result of higher interest rates.  If you believed in “low for long” and now see there’s a permanent increase in rates of 250 basis points on top of the cyclical increase, then ultimately monetary policy works more powerfully than normal.   Once rates plateau, how long should they stay there?   Our Survey of Monetary Analysts expects a significantly long plateau. I’m not commenting on whether that’s too short or too long. But I absolutely sign up to the monetary policy philosophy that wherever we get to, we should be slow to come down until we have very strong evidence – not just in the forecast but also in our ongoing assessment of underlying inflation – that we are returning inflation to target.  Whenever we do come to this point, I imagine that we will bracket the decision to hold rates with a clear commitment, which I would definitely share, that if it turns out more is needed, then we will do more. We should not be reluctant to revisit whatever level is needed.  The market is pricing a terminal rate by mid-summer and a rate cut at the start of next year. Is that a plausible period for a plateau?   There are several factors which can lead to a divergence between the market view and the central bank view of the future interest rate paths. There’s quite a wide range of estimates, with this high uncertainty that we have about what’s going on in terms of the impact of the energy crisis, the impact of the war, the impact of global tightening and the impact of our own tightening. So the market may collectively have a different view to us. There’s high value in durability, so not responding to every twist and turn in data.    We didn’t adhere to simple-minded equations in the hiking cycle, and we're not going to adhere to simple-minded equations in the future cutting cycle either.   Both you and Isabel Schnabel have argued that transmission may have slowed down, and Ms Schnabel said this could call for more forceful monetary policy action. What’s your view on this?  This is a complex question. Just a few minutes ago we talked about factors that may have increased the power of monetary policy. The fact that we’re moving from super low rates and the fact there’s a significant permanent component in these moves increase the power of monetary policy. The fact that the economy has a lot of sectors which rely on intangible capital and distant future earnings increases the power of monetary policy.  Then we come to the speed of monetary policy. The fact that there are fewer floating rate mortgages now is a mitigator.  In a number of countries, the fact that households are now less indebted compared to 2008 is significant. The fact that the banking sector is well capitalised may slow down monetary policy but in a very welcome way, which is avoiding that tightening spills over into a full-blown credit crunch.  The fact that in 2008-2012 Europe had a lot of financial distress, which was definitely disinflationary, doesn’t mean we think that is how monetary policy should work. Monetary policy should work more smoothly. But I would agree that monetary policy is working less dramatically, in the sense that it’s smoother . And this is why we need to go back to what we just talked about: persistence. It could be the case for monetary policy to work in this way, through a persistent increase in rates.  The fact that we think monetary policy should work normally is something to view positively.  Fabio Panetta said that in restrictive territory, the ECB should move in smaller steps. Do you subscribe to this view?   When we started raising rates, I laid out my thinking on this issue, which boils down to two factors. One is distance to the terminal rate. In December we assessed the terminal rate de facto and we said there’s a significant gap, so we needed a number of significant moves.  The other factor is the risk assessment. This is where the progress in underlying inflation is going to matter, in addition to the forecast.   What’s a greater risk, doing too much or too little?   Let me differentiate between two risk assessments. One, the most important one, is what is the risk to our inflation target of 2%? I think the risk remains skewed to the upside. We look at scenarios, such as whether inflation expectations get de-anchored or a wage-price spiral gets embedded. You can definitely come up with plausible scenarios for inflation that doesn’t come back to 2% quickly enough. The scenarios where inflation falls below 2%, you can put some weight on them. But that’s fixable in the sense that if the inflation dynamic weakens more quickly, then we can adjust. But in the upside scenario, where inflation doesn’t come back quickly enough, then the longer it remains high, the more it becomes normalised, and then we have a significant problem.  But the reality is that there are a lot of possibilities on either side of the baseline. Look at the dramatic changes in gas prices since December.   "
2023-02-27,Christine Lagarde,Interview with The Economic Times (India),"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted M.C. Govardhana Rangan on 24 February 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with The Economic Times (India)   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted M.C. Govardhana Rangan on 24 February 2023 27 February 2023  A generation of central bankers did not bother about inflation at all. For a year now that seems to be the only issue. What went wrong?   My predecessors and many central bankers around the world had to fight deflation, and they had to adjust policy as a result of that. More recently, we saw prices rise. And that was largely as a result of higher energy prices and supply bottlenecks. Many of us assumed that it would be transitory as is often the case with supply-driven shocks. But then came the war in Ukraine, and the rarification of supply of oil and gas and the price increases that we witnessed.   So the war changed everything…   We went from COVID lock down with reduced activity to the reopening of the economy. You suddenly wanted to go to the restaurant or to the bar with friends. There was a surge in demand which was met by restrained supply.   Interest rates need to rise to fight inflation, but the magnitude of the increases became a surprise. How long will this have to go on for?  We had to take prompt and significant measures. In December 2021, we announced that we were going to stop our pandemic-related net asset purchases. Since July, we have hiked interest rates at a pace and size that is unprecedented. Interest rates are the most efficient tool in the present circumstances. There is every reason to believe that we will do another 50 basis points in March. After that, we will see. We are data dependent.   So the pace of increases could slow?  We will do more hikes if necessary to return inflation to our target of 2% in a timely manner. It will take what it will take. What I know is that we will return inflation to 2%. And we want to not only return it to 2%, but to keep it there sustainably.   There is always a trade-off between inflation and growth. The market is factoring in a recession and a possible easing by central banks sooner rather than later. What is your reading?   I don't have a timeline. I have an objective, which is our target. We need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%, and to keep rates there for as long as necessary to be confident that inflation returns to 2% in a timely manner. That's the mantra. Hiking rates inevitably dampens demand. And what we're trying to do is to adjust demand. That's the mechanical impact that we expect from what we are doing. But as I said, it's going to be data dependent. We will assess at every meeting, and we will decide meeting by meeting what we do.   Rate increases have an impact on financial markets. In a 2015 speech as International Monetary Fund Managing Director you warned about the consequences of the lift off of interest rates. What impact is this tightening going to have? It affected bank earnings last quarter.   In order to fight inflation, we want that our interest hikes are passed through to the financial sector, including to banks. My hope is, because we want monetary transmission to be channelled through the economy, that banks will also reflect those interest rate hikes in their remuneration of deposits. Because that really should take place.   This is coupled with the draining of liquidity. We have seen instances like freezing of withdrawals, wobbly banks and shadow banks. What impact would falling liquidity have, and how well prepared are we if another crisis were to emerge? What are the risks of tighter liquidity in financial markets?   First of all, the banking system is a lot stronger - the capital ratios, the liquidity ratios, the leverage - all of that has significantly improved. We are going to only partially reinvest the redemptions from our asset purchase programme APP as of March, which will effectively reduce the footprint of the ECB in financial markets. But we're doing that at a measured pace. Our reinvestments will decline by 15 billion euros per month on average until the end of June 2023. It's measured, it's predictable, it's transparent. Markets know what to expect. They can prepare for that, and I think that they do so.  It's one year since war in Ukraine began. What are your thoughts on where it is headed and its impact on the global economy?  Today [24 February] is the anniversary of this horrible invasion by Russia of Ukraine with no justification and no valid reason. We can only have sorrow, sadness, and horror when we see what is going on in Ukraine. Mr. Putin's attempt to unsettle, disorganise and divide the Europeans has been a complete failure. Because the Europeans stuck together. NATO was reinforced. We found alternative sources of energy. We have significantly reduced our dependence on both gas and oil coming from Russia, and Ukraine is stronger. From those points of view, it has not been a success for Mr. Putin. And if anything, the Europeans have demonstrated solidarity amongst themselves. And they are demonstrating solidarity with Ukraine to help the country protect its territory.  But the reaction from across the world to Russia’s war hasn’t been the same when we look at sanctions. What does this mean for the global economic order?  It is natural for countries to protect their territory. I wouldn't want my country to be invaded, you wouldn’t want your country to be invaded. We want to protect the territorial integrity of all nations. There is no reason that this principle should not be respected. The $60 price setting for a barrel of oil has been a good measure. Those who purchase oil from Russia have benefited. But I would hope that people think about what it means. What if a neighbouring country suddenly invaded for no valid reason? I know some countries are watching and do not like the situation, but they don't like to take sides either. But we should reflect on the principles that are being violated here and why we are not using the multilateral framework and rules anymore.   Coming to the multilateral framework, the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) relevance appears to be declining with regional trading blocs becoming the order of the day. What’s the future of global trade that was the cornerstone for decades?  Wasn't it a very good Indian economist who said that the trade system was like a spaghetti bowl? It used to be like that 20 years ago and to a certain extent it still is as we still have a subset of regional trade arrangements. But the WTO under the leadership of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has made progress. They managed to reach agreement on fisheries subsidies. I've been Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and I know it is really hard. And if she has managed to get an agreement on fisheries subsidies at the WTO, I'm not losing hope in the WTO.  The sparring between the United States and China that began with Mr. Trump accusing China of stealing intellectual property and spying is only deteriorating. How do you see this playing out for global trade?  When it comes to trade and the global economy, I hope that we don't see a decoupling either in trade or in technology that would damage the benefits that we can draw from trade. And that would undo what we have achieved over the last decade. I strongly believe in a trade and economic system that is based on rules, and not based on whoever has the strongest arm to defend himself. When I was a young lawyer, there were countries that were considered to be the intellectual property infringers. And today, they are the most active intellectual property propagandists. The wheel turns.  In 2015, after meeting Prime Minister Modi and the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley you said ‘the new government is skilfully shifting the focus to good macroeconomic management, clean and efficient government and inclusive development.’ Eight years later what is your assessment of India?  I haven’t studied Indian economics as much and as deeply as I did at that time because it's no longer my job. But when I look at Indian economic data, it's a country that has done much better than others around the world. If you look at the GDP figures, if you look at unemployment, which has increased but not in dramatic ways, I would say that there has been continued progress.   What do you expect in the coming days and years?   I see the Indian G-20 presidency as a fantastic opportunity for India to draw on its own experience in the field of digitalisation, digital currency, regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and to push that agenda on a universal basis to bring some sanity into this particular sector. India has been at it for a long time. I think that India has great experience. Both the minister and the central bank governor have put that on the agenda and I hope they will really push it. I think it's critically important that it is done by a country like India. Another topic to push is the international financial architecture, the repurposing of the development banks, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund. India is legitimate in pushing for this.  What makes you believe that India could deliver when financial developments like these in the past mostly originated in the West?  Because I think that there is massive transformation. Everything is moving to digital. It could be that if you asked ChatGPT, it could draft this interview. Everything is now moving in a digital era with artificial intelligence and mining of massive amounts of data. India has huge expertise and is ahead of the game in many ways. The way in which you came up with the individual identification (Aadhaar) is a case in point. Nandan Nilekani was a pioneer, who inspired the world with his mechanism. It was copied and inspired many corners of the world.   There is a stand-off between the Indian and European market regulators on inspection of financial institutions here. It is threatening to lock out European banks from Indian markets. How does it get resolved? Don’t we need each other at the end of the day?   We all need each other at the end of the day. I stick to my principles. I believe in the rule of law. I believe in inclusiveness. And I think that solutions have to be worked out between reasonable people who believe in these same principles. But I don't want to take a stand on this particular issue, because it's not my call.   Can that be resolved? During the Greek crisis you used a phrase that became the title of a book by the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis?   `Adults in the room.’ We always need good adults in the room.  While monetary policy has been rational, the fiscal side in many countries has been weak. How does that play out?  The general principle in the current circumstance is that fiscal and monetary policy should not work at cross purposes. Because if fiscal is too expansionary, stimulates too much, monetary policy is going to have to tighten more than it otherwise would. So there has to be good coordination. We're trying to get it to work that way in Europe. In Europe, it's a lot more difficult - we have one central bank and 20 fiscal authorities.  How much does the fiscal side have to move to make monetary policies effective?  We need to focus on the quality of the fiscal response. We are telling governments that they should make sure that their fiscal support is temporary. If, for instance, a government supports people because of high energy prices, then if energy prices come down, the support should be reduced. Governments should target their support at people who need it most. And it should be done in such a way that people still have an incentive to reduce their energy consumption. So, temporary, targeted, and tailored. Those are the three key principles.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine changed a lot. Climate change is close to your heart. Has it been put on the back burner with many countries going back to coal?  The instant reaction to the war and to the blackmail on energy by Mr. Putin has been counterproductive from a climate change point of view, because some countries just had to revert to coal. But I am hopeful that in the medium term it will be positive. Because it has given us the awareness that we cannot be dependent on fossil fuel suppliers. And when you look at the speed at which some countries are now moving into renewable sources of energy, it has accelerated, and it will continue to accelerate.  There’s a lot more action on diversity and gender equality. Has enough been done?  Societies have moved. When I look at my grandmother, my mother, myself, and my daughters-in-law, there is a continuum. But it's laborious, it's not over. And it requires various things. One is learning. The education of young girls is fundamentally important. The second is law. There are countries where a large part of the legislation is still discriminating against women. And there are countries that have made a point of eliminating all discrimination. I was Minister of Finance when a law was voted in by the French parliament that required at least 30% of board members of publicly quoted companies to be women. Suddenly companies, which earlier said they could not find competent women who wanted to serve on their boards, realised they existed. The third element is empowering young girls and women to develop their talent. They have to be in parliament, in government, participate in the corporate world.   Many youngsters aspire to careers in finance. You are a trained lawyer. How did you end up at the top of the financial world? What are the learnings?  You hit the nail on the head: it’s about learning. Careers are not linear anymore. They used to be, not anymore. When you look at your daughters, when I look at my sons, they know that they're going to change jobs. And they know they're going to have to learn along the way. That's what I did as well. I was lucky to have had good educational training to begin with. I studied law, but I also studied economics, and I studied political science. And after having been a lawyer for 20 years, I moved into trade, and trade was a very good introduction to economics. I had to learn and learn and work hard. One always has to be curious, challenging those who know.    "
2023-02-25,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Helsingin Sanomat,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Petri Sajari","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Helsingin Sanomat   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Petri Sajari 25 February 2023  President Christine Lagarde, the European Commission said last week that the euro area is set to narrowly avoid a technical recession. Before that, a recession was expected at the turn of the year. So how confident are you that recession is now avoidable in the euro area?  The most recent projections from both the IMF and the European Commission suggest that there will not be a recession in the EU or the euro area this year. But there is a lot of uncertainty, and one central question is where the war is heading. Another big question is how the lifting of COVID restrictions in China will affect its economic recovery and the global economy. Wage negotiations and fiscal support will also play an important role.  What do you think are the main reasons for the better-than-anticipated economic developments in the euro area?  The euro area has benefited from a warm winter, which on the other hand is not a good thing as such because it is a manifestation of climate change. The energy saving measures and the solidarity between euro area countries have also played their part.  What do you mean by solidarity?  European countries have responded to President Putin’s unlawful and unjustified war by working better together. We will no longer buy Russian oil, and gas imports from Russia have gone down radically. Governments, such as Austria and Germany, Estonia and Finland, have been cooperating on securing energy supplies. These actions are an expression of solidarity to counter the consequences of this terrible war.  Let’s move on to inflation. Are you confident that headline inflation is now on a declining path?  Headline inflation is still unacceptably high, but it is likely to decline because energy costs are falling. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have already fallen to pre-pandemic levels. Core inflation – inflation without energy and food prices – is currently still at its highest level ever: in January, it was 5.3% for the euro area as a whole.  You have repeatedly said the ECB must stay on course when it comes to tightening monetary policy. The Governing Council intends to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at the next monetary policy meeting in March and will then evaluate the subsequent path of monetary policy. So now, from your perspective, should the Governing Council also stand ready for a 50 basis point tightening in May? I mean after March, if it is warranted by the incoming data.  I’m not navel gazing or reading a crystal ball. I want to see the new data and I want to hear the views of my colleagues when they see the same data. It’s on that basis that we will take our decision. But one thing is sure: we want to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.  So it is not impossible or out of the question that there would be another 50 basis point hike after March?  Our decisions will be determined by the incoming data and driven by our goal of returning inflation to 2%.  Some academics have said the issue is that the ECB should have started raising interest rates earlier than July 2022. In September, you said in the press conference that the ECB had underestimated earlier inflation and made forecasting errors. So how could those errors have affected the monetary policy decisions?  Most economists and forecasters initially anticipated that high inflation would be transitory and temporary, and that it would fade away. However, inflation spread into a much broader range of products and services. I’m not sure if starting rate hikes three months earlier would have made a major difference. What matters now is that we consistently stay the course.  But in hindsight…  We are looking at our forecasting models to see how we can better factor in elements that were not in those models and that could possibly be difficult to include in them. We could not have modelled the invasion of Ukraine by Russia or the supply bottlenecks caused by the COVID pandemic. All in all, we must improve our projections and do better in the future. Some of our Governing Council members are involved in this project. One of them is our Chief Economist Philip Lane.  A couple of questions now regarding the pandemic emergency purchase programme. Some academics have been arguing that the extremely loose monetary policy, especially in 2021, went too far because the fiscal stimulus was also strong at the same time. So, in hindsight again, to what extent did the monetary and fiscal stimulus together lead to the acceleration of inflation?  If we had not done all that, you would be asking me much tougher questions: why did we not continue quantitative easing for longer? And why did we not ensure financial stability by facilitating the flow of liquidity? I think that in this case it was right to err on the side of doing a lot rather than too little to safeguard the economic recovery.  You mentioned that it was good in 2020, when the pandemic hit the economy, that fiscal policy and monetary policy went in the same direction. Now we see that they are not going in the same direction. From your perspective, how big a problem is it that the central bank is trying to do everything to tame inflation but, at the same time, fiscal policymakers are trying to do many things to protect voters from getting hurt by high energy prices, which is leading to inflation?  Fiscal policy and monetary policy were completely aligned during the pandemic. Governments had to make fiscal decisions to support the economy and avoid its collapse, and to prevent bankruptcies and massive layoffs of employees. And we reacted to the pandemic-related risks to price and financial stability by launching a dedicated purchase programme and providing targeted lending. But the current environment of high inflation is different. Therefore, we adjusted monetary policy by ending net purchases and raising rates. And we are of the view that fiscal support needs to be targeted, tailored and temporary.   Have you seen any kind of rolling back so far?  There is clearly a risk of monetary and fiscal policies working at cross purposes.  A historical question about your tenure as President of the ECB: are you comfortable with the decisions you have made over the last couple of years? Or are there some regrets?  If anything, we should have maybe identified some inflation movements a little earlier, and not have assumed that there were too many transitory aspects to it.   The next question would be very similar to the one that we’ve already discussed. The primary objective of the ECB’s monetary policy of course is to maintain price stability, and you have said government support measures should be rolled back promptly as the energy crisis becomes less acute. And if they are not rolled back, they will rev up the inflationary pressures and lead to stronger monetary tightening. How important is it right now to coordinate fiscal policy with monetary policy in fighting inflation, and are there actually energy crises in the euro area anymore? Because, as you said, prices are down to where they were before the crisis.   The euro area economy is in a much better position now than it was last year. But we shouldn’t be complacent. Neither on the energy front nor on the inflation front. The right fiscal policy and monetary policy mix must be very finely balanced. What is important at the moment is that fiscal policy does not fuel inflation that would then call for tighter monetary policy.  Would it be possible that 2024 will be the year of monetary loosening if everything goes as predicted?  As I said, I’m not going to predict what monetary policy decisions will be. I’ll wait until our economists project new numbers and we will then analyse very carefully the data that we are given, and we will apply judgement also considering the new data. We have to be confident that inflation returns to 2%. And this has to be sufficiently sustained for us to be confident that we have reached our goal.  In the Governing Council’s next monetary policy meeting in March, we will also receive new projections from our economists. Then we will have a new outlook for the economy.  Central bankers are usually defined as hawks or doves. And in your second press conference as President of the European Central Bank, you wore a brooch depicting an owl, which is the symbol of wisdom. So how would you describe yourself: a hawk or a dove?  Oh, definitely an owl. One of the attributes of owls is that they have 360-degree vision. The ECB’s job is to ensure price stability. One of my jobs, in addition to fully understanding the economic situation, is to look at all the views around the Governing Council table to understand how my colleagues see the situation at the euro area level and at the country level, and to help them make the right decisions that will lead us to our goal – the price stability target.  We can see from the minutes of the December meeting that there was a discussion about what would be the right size of the hike. And we know that in Europe there are countries with a very heavy debt burden. Is it the case in the Governing Council now that those members who are representing countries with large debt burdens are more likely not to support as big a hike as the hawks would probably be willing to do?  The Governing Council members’ views are influenced by many aspects. But I wouldn’t pass a general judgement on a central bank governor that if you come from a high debt country, you’re a dove, whereas if you come from a low debt country, you’re a hawk. The beauty of the Eurosystem is that everybody comes to the table with conviction and with an open mind. And in a way you have to drop your preconceptions as much as you can to reach consensus. I have to say that the Governor of the Bank of Finland is remarkable for that too. I don’t know whether he is an owl, but he could be.  In Finland, GDP has not been growing for ten years. That is a fact. And then another fact is that it is because of weak labour productivity growth. So what would be your advice to increase labour productivity in Finland in order to secure long-term economic growth?  I think the improvement of productivity is a really key objective to have for Finland, as for many euro area countries, by focusing on working life, the availability of a skilled labour force, investment in education and promotion of innovation. I want to see another Nokia coming out of Finland, this beautiful country with 5.5 million inhabitants, with the most inventive, beautifully designed cell phones.   "
2023-02-17,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow and Alexander Weber on 15 February 2023","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow and Alexander Weber on 15 February 2023 17 February 2023  How much closer are we to achieving 2% inflation over the medium term, compared to December?  We are still far away from claiming victory on inflation. A broad disinflation process has not even started in the euro area. If we look at underlying inflation in particular, we are seeing that it is very high and more persistent than headline inflation. Underlying inflation developments play an important role in our thinking.  Energy prices have dropped quite significantly, headline inflation is slowing faster than expected. How will that impact the outlook for core inflation?  We are already seeing that the drop in energy prices is feeding into headline inflation, and eventually it will also feed into underlying inflation. The pass-through from lower energy prices to core inflation may be slower than on the way up, but eventually it is going to happen. What is more important when it comes to medium-term inflation is the development of wages and profits.  If we look at our wage trackers, we are seeing that wage growth has picked up substantially. It is expected to be around 4 to 5% in the years to come, which is too high to be consistent with our 2% inflation target even when taking productivity growth into account. Also, given a longer duration of wage contracts compared to the US and a more centralised bargaining process, one could expect wage growth in the euro area to be more persistent. So wage developments are going to be key for our assessment of underlying inflation and therefore also for inflation over the medium term.  The second important factor is profits. In the past, many firms were not only able to fully pass through their higher costs, but often they were even able to increase their profit margins. So we also need to look at the evolution of profits. Finally, both price- and wage-setting depend on inflation expectations. Through our determined action, we have been able to keep inflation expectations anchored. We are seeing longer-term inflation expectations broadly anchored at 2%.  One important component in wage demands is past inflation. Would it be fair to assume that wage pressures will abate as inflation eases?  Hopefully. But wage growth has to be consistent with inflation returning to 2%, and that’s what we need to monitor. That said, it is highly unlikely that inflation pressures are going to vanish all by themselves.  Many forecasts see core inflation above headline inflation before long. How would the ECB deal with this situation, given its mandate focuses on the latter?  The attractor of headline inflation over the medium term is core inflation, which is why it matters so much for our monetary policy. We have defined our target in terms of headline inflation, but we know what drives headline inflation over the medium term is core inflation.  Considering all the points you’ve made so far, can you think of anything that would stop the ECB from delivering that half-point hike it has signaled for March?  Given the current level of policy rates and the level and persistence of underlying inflation, a rate hike by 50 basis points is necessary under virtually all plausible scenarios in order to bring inflation back to 2%. There is no inconsistency between our principle of data-dependency and these intentions because it is very unlikely that the incoming data is going to put this intention into question.  Where will rates go after March, based on information available today?  Let me explain how I see our reaction function. It comprises two decisions. The first is how far we need to raise rates so they become sufficiently restrictive. The second decision is for how long we need to keep interest rates at this restrictive level.  Let’s start with the first question, the determination of the terminal rate. Conceptually, one would like to look at the neutral rate, but that concept is of little practical use because we are not able to estimate it reliably in real time. Instead, we need to look at incoming data for evidence that our policy is being restrictive.  There are three stages in the transmission process: The first is from our policy measures to financing conditions. There we have seen quite a substantial tightening. The second stage is from financing conditions to aggregate demand, and the third stage is from aggregate demand to inflation.  What really matters for our decision on the terminal rate is the second stage. Are our monetary policy measures effective in slowing the growth of aggregate demand? Recent data show some weakening of the economy towards the end of last year, but the question is whether, and to what extent, this was driven by our monetary policy or whether it was predominantly a consequence of the energy price shock. The bank lending survey, for example, shows a sharp tightening of credit standards. But the largest part of this tightening is driven by changes in banks’ risk perception and risk tolerance. Banks’ cost of funds have played only a very small role so far. And now that the economy is proving more resilient, part of these factors may even reverse and counteract our intentions to reign in loan demand. Therefore, it is not so easy to judge whether our measures are already restrictive.  The other factor is that the labour market is very strong. We have seen marked growth in employment in the fourth quarter. Surveys show that hiring intentions are strong and rising. The only place where we already see unambiguous evidence of transmission is in the housing market, which is most sensitive to interest rates. Mortgage growth has fallen, the intentions to buy houses are going down, and we are seeing a weakening of housing investments. We do not yet see such trends more broadly. I think that in May we will have a clearer picture on that. Now, on the second question, how long do we need to keep interest rates at a restrictive level? The answer is: until we see robust evidence that inflation — and in particular underlying inflation — is going back to our target of 2% in a timely and durable manner. A turning point in underlying inflation is not sufficient because this turning point is likely driven by the gradual pass-through from lower energy prices to underlying inflation rather than the more persistent components. Over the medium term, inflation will mainly be driven by wage and profit developments.  Can we expect to get some guidance in March on the decision on interest rates in May?  I cannot give you an answer because I simply do not know. We shifted towards a meeting-by-meeting approach and data-dependency because of the high uncertainty. But it can be useful to give an idea about the direction of travel.  What would you need to see to consider slowing down rate hikes to 25 basis points in May?  I would need to see that our monetary policy is becoming restrictive, which should show up in lending markets, in labour markets, and in the various aggregate demand components.  How do you deal with time lags in the transmission process?  This rate-hiking cycle is quite unusual due to its speed and the synchronicity across many major economies. There is a lot of uncertainty about the transmission process and time lags, and this is precisely why we need to look so carefully at the incoming data. There are reasons to believe that transmission may be weaker than in previous episodes. We have seen a notable shift from variable towards fixed rates in mortgages. We have also seen a shift towards longer maturities in the bond market. In addition, our surveys suggest that firms see an urgency to invest in digital and green technologies. And then we have the very strong labour market, which means that the usual transmission through a decline in employment may not work in the same way. All these factors would suggest that there could be a lower sensitivity of aggregate demand to changes in interest rates.  Does that mean you will need to raise rates higher than otherwise to achieve results?  We may have to act more forcefully if transmission turns out to be weaker.  Are you concerned at all of cliff effects should transmission channels suddenly unclog?  The question is whether transmission is weaker or delayed. I would say there are arguments for it being weaker. But even if it is delayed, we always have the possibility to respond. We have the option to lower rates again if we get the impression that our monetary policy stance is getting too restrictive. From today’s perspective, that is nothing I foresee anytime soon.  Economists’ forecasts for the terminal rate are at around 3.5% by June. The market is pricing a very similar outcome. Is this something you think is mostly right or do you have fundamentally different ideas from today’s perspective?  Markets are priced for perfection. They assume inflation is going to come down very quickly toward 2% and it is going to stay there, while the economy will do just fine. That would be a very good outcome, but there is a risk that inflation proves to be more persistent than is currently priced by financial markets. As regards the terminal rate, we need to look at the incoming data to see how far we need to go.  You’ve argued recently that higher credit costs mustn’t stand in the way of investing in the green transition. How does that relate to the ECB’s ability to dampen demand to get inflation down?  Interest rates are unlikely to be the main hurdle for the green transition. The hurdles are coming from the government side. There remain many bureaucratic hurdles, strong subsidies for fossil fuels, uncertainty about future government policies as regards the green transition, and a lack of a green investment initiative from the public side. And we still lack a true capital markets union, which would be important for the green transition. The other question is whether the increase in interest rates puts a brake on the green transition by suppressing demand. And there the answer is that the green transition in my view can never work in an inflationary environment, when there is a risk that inflation is getting out of control. We have seen how much uncertainty is created by high inflation. Uncertainty puts a brake on investment. Our best contribution to fostering investment — in the green transition but also in other areas — is to get back to price stability and create, as far as we can, a stable macroeconomic environment.  So the best solution is fighting inflation quickly now with restrictive rates, making investments less attractive in the very short term, but then lowering borrowing costs so the transition can go on?  That is one point. But of course governments also have an impact on the composition of demand. The current fiscal measures do not channel demand to areas that are most needed for the green transition. There is very little public investment, many subsidies are directed towards supporting fossil fuels, and the broad-based stimulus supports consumption. There is a role for the government to impact the composition of aggregate demand, which could – through the effect on potential growth – also support price stability. What governments do matters for the medium-term inflation outlook. And what we have seen so far was not very supportive of price stability.  From March, you’ll start to reduce your bond holdings. Is it possible to say how much those roll-offs will contribute to policy tightening?  Let me give you the rationale for why we are doing quantitative tightening (QT). The first reason is that the current high level of excess reserves is simply not necessary to implement our monetary policy and steer money market rates. The second point is that a large balance sheet has side effects. Our large footprint in financial markets can hamper market functioning. We are seeing collateral scarcity, which is partly related to our footprint in the market. And the third argument is that our large balance sheet provides significant accommodation, which is not in line with our monetary policy stance. At the moment, interest rates are our key policy tool. However, by doing QT, we can provide additional tightening. But I would not see interest rates and QT as perfect substitutes because they are acting on different parts of the yield curve. I see the two tools, in the current phase of the tightening cycle, as being complementary. They are working in the same direction. How big the tightening impact is, is an empirical question. Quantitative easing (QE) was working through various channels and not all of them may still operate in the same way. There is, for example, a signaling channel which may be weaker, or even absent, under QT. But other channels, like the portfolio rebalancing channel, could be expected to work quite symmetrically. Therefore, estimates on the impact of QE could also broadly apply under QT. There is not so much empirical data on QT that we can use, but I would say that there is a certain symmetry.  Do you expect the pace of roll offs to be stepped up after the initial starting phase?  We want the pace to be measured and predictable and our current announcement goes until the end of the second quarter. QT could be sped up after that, as is currently priced in financial markets. But this still needs to be decided.  We are confident that QT is going to run smoothly. We are analysing the risk-absorption capacities of financial market participants. What we see at the moment is that investors are returning to the bond market, which is becoming more attractive due to higher yields. This is even going to increase when we are getting closer to the terminal rate. Of course, it also matters what is happening in the rest of the world. But so far we believe that QT is going to run rather smoothly.  How much does the level of long-term interest rates matter when you determine the pace of QT in the coming months?  We need to reduce the balance sheet and we want to do so in a measured and predictable way without causing any disturbances. So, it is not so much determined explicitly by stance considerations because this is not our main stance tool, but it is decided in a more technical way. It is clear that QT tends to have an effect on the longer end of the yield curve. But it is not that we are steering the slope of the yield curve. That is not the way we think about it.  You said recently that you’d expect the ECB to hold a structural bond portfolio in the future. Is it possible to estimate how big that is, and how long it will take the ECB to get there?  We are currently reviewing our operational framework and we hope to finish that review by the end of the year. One of the questions we need to answer is whether we want to keep the current de facto floor system or whether we want to return to a corridor system for steering interest rates. That has implications for the size of our balance sheet in the steady state. But even under a floor system, there are different approaches and you could run a floor system with a very large balance sheet or with a somewhat smaller balance sheet. These are still open questions that we need to look at. There are arguments in various directions. It is a technical, but very important discussion that we will have over the course of this year. So far I cannot tell you where we are going to end up. What is clear is that the current process of QT is gradual, so we are still quite far away from the point where the size of our balance sheet may affect our ability to steer short-term interest rates. This gives us a bit of time, but it is important, at some point, to give an indication where we think the balance sheet is going to end up.   "

I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Why ECB is not fighting inflation?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Tackling inflation is our top priority. We have hiked interest rates at a record pace and are starting to shrink our bond holdings. And we will stay the course in raising interest rates to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a timely manner. #AskECB   Dear   @Isabel_Schnabel  , inflation-adjusted wages have fallen all across the euro area since 2019Q4. Will more rate hikes mean the ECB thinks that wages need to fall further?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Quite the opposite: further rate hikes will help bring inflation back to our target, which – given nominal wages – will increase real wages. #AskECB    #AskECB   You are creating new poors and destroying business of your own citizens because of a war we didnt choose to participate, your are richer with billions in profits and EU citizens are destryed trying to survive. Shame on you   @Isabel_Schnabel: No, by fighting high inflation we are supporting the sustainable growth of the euro area economy. The war has made us all worse off, but we’re doing our best to limit the consequences. The economy will not thrive if inflation is exceptionally high. #AskECB   Dear   @Isabel_Schnabel  , based on your last speech, why you think a green lending facility targeted at reducing imported #fossilflation via energy efficiency & renewables would not be a suitable option in a tightening phase? Fossilflation is happening now! Thanks :)   @Isabel_Schnabel: We need to counter high inflation by tightening monetary policy. At the moment, new lending operations, even if green, are not in line with our price stability mandate. Bringing inflation back to target is our best contribution to the green transition. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel  : For those who missed it, please see my recent speech on monetary policy tightening and the green transition:  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230110~21c89bef1b.en.html    #AskECB    Why did the ECB in 2022 underestimate inflation and state that the rise is only temporary? Now inflation will stay with us for years to come.   @Isabel_Schnabel: We and many other forecasters underestimated the persistence of inflation caused by energy price shocks, supply chain disruptions and strong demand. We are doing everything we can to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a timely manner. #AskECB   Why does ECB seem to care only about homeowners and house prices?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We care about our mandate: price stability. Housing costs matter for people’s expenditures but are only partly included in the inflation index. In our strategy review we recommended to better reflect housing costs in the future: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/search/review/html/ecb.strategyreview_monpol_strategy_overview.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Some members of the FOMC said that the lags of monetary policy are much shorter than used to be. The full impact of policy tightening is reflected not in 12-18 months, but in 9-12, primarily because of the forward guidance. Do we see the same situation in the eurozone?Thx   @Isabel_Schnabel: The transmission lags of our current policy measures are highly uncertain. Therefore, we are closely monitoring the degree to which our measures are becoming restrictive based on incoming data. #AskECB   Are you introducing CBDC anytime?    @Isabel_Schnabel: We are currently investigating whether to introduce a digital euro, a digital form of central bank money that people can use across the euro area. In autumn 2023 we will decide about the next phase of this multi-year project: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/html/index.en.html #AskECB    @ecb   When do you think we will get at peak regarding rates hikes? How long is it necessary to remain at that level to be sure that inflation will fall back to your 2% objective?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Rates must reach a sufficiently restrictive level. We need to see that our policies are being transmitted to the economy. We’ll keep rates high until we see robust evidence that underlying inflation returns to our target in a timely and durable manner. #AskECB    #AskECB   Why are ECB’s decision makers not subject to the same rules of democratic oversight as other people and institutions who make important decisions that govern our daily lives? The ECB controls the worth of our money, in which people save their invested time/energy.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our independence must go with strong accountability. Therefore, we regularly explain our policies to the European people and their elected representatives, primarily via the @Europarl_EN. Read more: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel  , can you tell us what is the reasoning behind the arbitrary ""inflation"" target of 2%? why is it not 1% or 0%?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Many central banks have a 2% inflation target. It offers a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates. In the euro area, it also leaves room for differences in inflation across countries. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Read our explainer in 24 EU languages for more: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/educational/explainers/tell-me-more/html/stableprices.en.html #AskECB   Wie analysiert/überprüft die #ECB im Nachhinein, ob sinkende Inflationsraten in der Eurozone mit der Zinspolitik zusammen hingen? Was wäre die Konsequenz, wenn sich herausstellen sollte, dass die Inflation auch ohne Zinsanhebungen gesunken wäre?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Wir analysieren die Effekte der Geldpolitik in Strukturmodellen. Die derzeitige Inflation wird durch nachfrage- und angebotsseitige Faktoren getrieben und wird aller Voraussicht nach nicht von allein verschwinden. Daher muss die Geldpolitik handeln. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: We analyse the effects of monetary policy in structural models. Our current assessment suggests that inflation is driven by both demand- and supply-side factors and is unlikely to vanish by itself. Therefore, monetary policy needs to respond. #AskECB    #AskECB   Will the bank give up from the cash when the CBDC put into force? or is there any plan to keep some small amount of cash for minimal transactions? and how will banks create money under the CBDC regime? Thanks.   @Isabel_Schnabel: There is no intention to abandon cash. A digital euro would complement cash, not replace it. With a CBDC, the process of money creation would continue to work through banks. Please see our cash strategy: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/cash_strategy/html/index.en.html #AskECB   The only mandate ECB has is price stability. Why are you wasting your time and resources on climate related initiatives while your only mandate is in shatters?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: As climate change and the green transition affect price stability, we cannot ignore them. They are an integral part of our mandate. But governments are in the driving seat. See my recent speech: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220317_2~dbb3582f0a.en.html #fossilfation #greenflation #AskECB   Why do you have a Ukrainian flag beside your name? The ECB does not have jurisdiction over Ukraine, and you are not Ukrainian.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Like many others, I added the flag in solidarity with the people of Ukraine who are suffering from the unjust and unprovoked Russian war of aggression against their country. #StandWithUkraine #AskECB   Why was your ( ECB ) inflation forecasting so wrong?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The economy has been subject to unprecedented shocks, such as the pandemic and the horrible war in Ukraine. This has created exceptional challenges for all professional forecasters. We are continuously working to improve our models. #AskECB   How do you deal with the constant trolling by Bitcoin fanboys?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Everybody is entitled to their opinion, on social media and in real life, and exchanges of views are welcome as long as they are constructive. As a rule, I mute all accounts with insulting content. #AskECB   Hallo Isabel. I would like to ask you if you think the euro can last without further European integration? Should member states in your opinion, be willing to give up more national sovereignty to Brussels? Thanks for your answers. Best regards, Keimp   @Isabel_Schnabel: The monetary union would be strengthened if the single monetary policy were complemented by a fiscal policy tool at European level. This would improve risk sharing and offer better ways to respond to large shocks, as with #NGEU in the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   How big of an yield and inflation impact do you project with the end to full reinvestments under the APP? Can the elasticities you show your Sep21 speech be applied when reducing the stock of holdings?  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210915~75de3a2dfa.en.html     @Isabel_Schnabel: The anticipation of balance sheet run-off has already likely contributed to rising bond yields in the euro area. We would expect the effects of QE and QT to be largely symmetric. #AskECB   Is there a fixed limit to the new ""Green QE""?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The volume of our bond purchases under QE is determined solely by our monetary policy objective. Given this, we aim to decarbonise our corporate bond holdings in line with the Paris Agreement by tilting our purchases towards greener firms. #AskECB    #AskECB   Please tell us if you have open information for ECB developed CBDC and especially how are you going to implement privacy and anonymity with it?   @Isabel_Schnabel: A digital euro cannot be fully anonymous, especially for large payments, because it could then be used for illicit purposes. But ensuring a high degree of privacy of personal data and payments will be one of our key priorities: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp221107~dcc0cd8ed9.en.html #AskECB   Why does the ECB need an office in London?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: The United Kingdom remains an important partner of the European Union and the euro area, and London is still a global financial centre. Therefore, the ECB has a small office in London to maintain our network and collect market intelligence. #AskECB   Dear   @Isabel_Schnabel  , you said a green lending facility wouldn’t be compatible with monetary tightening. Providing the impact of tightening on the financing of the EU ecological and energy transition, isn’t this reasoning exposing the EU to future inflationary shocks?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Please see my reply: #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: We need to counter high inflation by tightening monetary policy. At the moment, new lending operations, even if green, are not in line with our price stability mandate. Bringing inflation back to target is our best contribution to the green transition. #AskECB    #AskECB   Do you or your family members own any #Bitcoin   @Isabel_Schnabel  ? And why?   @Isabel_Schnabel: No, I consider such an investment too risky. And as a high-level ECB official, I am not allowed to hold crypto-assets. Please see Art. 16.3 of our Code of Conduct regarding the rules on financial transactions: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOC_2022_478_R_0003&from=EN #AskECB    #AskECB   Is the ECB considering any reform to their process to meet the price stability objective in the aftermath of the current unprecedented inflation target slip?   @Isabel_Schnabel: No. We just revised our monetary policy strategy in 2021. Current high inflation is not caused by flaws in our framework. Our next review is planned for 2025.

Are the measures already adopted by the ECB sufficient for such sell off to happen quickly?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The transition needs to happen in those sectors that currently have the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, we have decided against an exclusion approach. We need to preserve incentives for transition.

Is the ECB turning an energy crisis into an economic crisis while euro is raising and desinflation has begun? Thanks!    @Isabel_Schnabel: Broad disinflation has not started in the euro area. We need to use all our tools to restore price stability and support sustainable growth. Otherwise we would see even sharper declines in real wages, and we may need to hike interest rates even more. #AskECB   Why do you lower IMMEDIATELY rates to 0% when inflation is below 2% and you do not act at all when inflation is so much above target?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: We take too high inflation as seriously as too low inflation. We are currently in the fastest rate hiking cycle in the ECB’s history. Our policy rates have gone up by 3 percentage points over the past seven months. And we still have ground to cover. #AskECB   Given the dismal record of your inflation projections, why don‘t you use the current inflation rate as a proxy for future inflation rates?   #AskECB  .   @Isabel_Schnabel: In today’s uncertain environment marked by unprecedented shocks, many forecasts, including our own, have been off the mark. That’s why we always use all available data, including current inflation, to get a better picture of the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Honest question (and thanks for doing this): Why would I as an individual, for the long term, prefer to hold a currency intended to lose 2% value a year over a currency with fixed supply?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro is one of the most stable currencies in the world and enjoys a lot of trust. Fixed supply does not guarantee a stable value of assets. They can still exhibit sharp price fluctuations. #AskECB   Hi   @Isabel_Schnabel  ! The approach laid out by the   @ECB   for the greening of CSPP is close to the one used by the   @BankofEngland  . However, this approach has already shown to be insufficient to achieve 1.5°C portfolio alignment. Will the ECB consider updating it?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further efforts are needed to make our operations Paris aligned. In a recent speech, I laid out three areas of action: corporate bond holdings, public sector bond holdings and lending operations including collateral. See here: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230110~21c89bef1b.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   what are the differences between swift and a CBDC?   @Isabel_Schnabel: These are two very different things: a central bank digital currency is digital money issued directly by a central bank for people. SWIFT is a private service provider for financial transactions and payments between banks worldwide. #AskECB   Do you think that the current path for ECB rate hikes priced in by markets is enough to return inflation to 2% in a timely manner?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The rate path rests on the market’s view that inflation returns to our target quickly. Our decisions will be based on incoming data. We need to see robust evidence that underlying inflation is returning to our target in a timely and durable manner. #AskECB    #AskECB   De Guindos said yesterday that he believes conditions are improving, and the eurozone could avoid recession. Is it possible to continue tightening in order to avoid a second round of inflation and avoid an economic recession?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Tighter financing conditions dampen economic demand and thereby economic activity. This does not necessarily lead to a recession. A soft landing is possible but not guaranteed. #AskECB   The latest BLS showed that credit conditions are worsening. Do you expect a credit crunch in the near term?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Tighter credit conditions are a first indication that monetary policy is becoming effective. But they also reflect banks’ risk perceptions that may change if the economy improves. Slower loan growth is an essential part of the transmission mechanism. #AskECB   I got only 1 question: When rates above core inflation? 😊   @Isabel_Schnabel: Real interest rates at all tenors have increased measurably in recent months, reflecting to a considerable extent the ongoing tightening of monetary policy. Persistently higher real rates are required to restore price stability. #AskECB    #AskECB   How do you see the current market pricing relative to your own expectation of the needed monetary policy tightening?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Please see my reply: #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: The rate path rests on the market’s view that inflation returns to our target quickly. Our decisions will be based on incoming data. We need to see robust evidence that underlying inflation is returning to our target in a timely and durable manner. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   would you say 50 is off the table for May?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: We cannot yet claim victory in taming inflation. That’s why we need to stay the course and raise rates significantly further. Whether another 50 basis point hike is needed will depend on incoming data and our assessment of the inflation outlook. #AskECB   What is your view on monetary policy lags - shorter, longer, or same as before - and the implications for the required tightening in the ECB's stance this year?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Please see my reply: #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: The transmission lags of our current policy measures are highly uncertain. Therefore, we are closely monitoring the degree to which our measures are becoming restrictive based on incoming data. #AskECB    #AskECB   You've said that ""So far, monetary tightening has had little effect"". However, in the last Bank Lending Survey, we see a high number of banks reporting a decrease in demand for credit because of the ""general level of interest rates"". What are your thoughts about that?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Monetary policy has had little effect so far *on inflation*. Tighter bank lending conditions are early signs that our tighter monetary policy is working. But they also seem to be driven by banks’ risk perceptions. #AskECB    #AskECB   you said that your main motivation for rising interest rates was to safeguard credibility and keep market expectations anchored. Which metric do you use to analyse the degree of expectations' anchoring? What evidence do we have that (de)anchoring exists & is tractable?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We look at a wide range of indicators from market pricing to surveys. Longer-term inflation expectations remain largely anchored, but the right-hand tail has increased in many cases, which we are closely monitoring. #AskECB   Dear Mrs   @Isabel_Schnabel  , what is the net effect on inflation the   @ecb   expects from China's return to growth and trade after its lockdowns?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: There are many different effects, including on energy and commodity prices, foreign demand, bottlenecks and international competition. The net effect on euro area inflation is likely to be positive in 2023. #AskECB    #AskECB   Do EBC consider any changes in central bank goals? Are ""green"" goals possible?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our primary mandate, defined by the Treaty, is price stability, which is affected by climate change. Without prejudice to price stability, we stand ready to support the fight against climate change and ensure alignment with the Paris Agreement. #AskECB   Hallo! Do you expect ECB to adopt a zero interest rate policy in the medium run, if at all?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The return of a low inflation, low growth environment with low interest rates is not my baseline but cannot be excluded. It depends on how big structural changes, like the green transition, demography, digitalisation, globalisation, will play out. #AskECB   What are the advantages for a country to join the eurozone?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro removes exchange rate fluctuations and thereby makes trade and travel easier. Even as inflation is far too high, the euro has provided more price stability on average than the national currencies before it. The euro is a symbol of our unity. #AskECB  Time to wrap up for today. Many thanks for your questions – I really enjoyed our chat! Take care, @Isabel_Schnabel #AskECB    "
2023-02-08,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Markus Zydra and Meike Schreiber ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Markus Zydra and Meike Schreiber  8 February 2023  Mr de Guindos, energy prices have fallen recently. Is the inflation nightmare coming to an end?   No, we  should still be concerned about inflation. There are indeed some favourable developments which are alleviating the pressure of inflation, including the easing of energy prices you mention. The euro’s appreciation in the foreign exchange markets is also contributing. Moreover, there are fewer pandemic-related supply shortages. However, we see that the reopening of the economy in China after the lockdown is leading to greater demand, for energy, for metals and for commodities. That can generate more price pressures. And wages are rising too.   Aren’t employees justified in asking for higher wages to offset inflation?  Yes, of course they are. But  a wage-price spiral must be avoided. Parties in the ongoing wage negotiations are looking back to the high inflation of the past year. But inflation will abate in the course of the year: we expect an average inflation rate of around 6% this year, with 3.6% in the last quarter. The trade unions may, however, be inclined to ask for excessive pay rises. We need to be careful.   Isn’t that a bit harsh? Low-income households have been particularly hard hit by inflation.     If we enter into a wage-price spiral, the ECB will have to raise interest rates by more than would otherwise have been needed. In a wage-price spiral no one wins. Governments need to offer support to those who are worst affected, by introducing targeted subsidies to mitigate the impact of inflation. People could then reduce their wage demands and the ECB would not have to tighten its monetary policy so much. That would benefit everyone.   Many people are angry: inflation is easing, but only slowly. And prices remain high, they will not fall back to 2021 levels.   That’s true. Even if inflation is gradually slowing down, prices are now generally at higher levels than they were one or one and a half years ago. I understand that people find that disappointing. But this inflation was caused by extraordinary shocks: the sudden reopening of the economy after the pandemic and the war against Ukraine. The ECB now has to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% target.   Looking back to a year and a half ago: in view of the high inflation, what would the ECB accept it got wrong in its monetary policy?    Central banks and many other organisations believed for a long time that the increase in inflation was temporary. I have to admit: that was a mistake, but the level of uncertainty was enormous. We all underestimated the persistence of inflation. In December 2021 we already decided to stop our pandemic-related net asset purchases and in July of the following year we started to raise interest rates. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have started reacting even sooner.     Should the ECB apologise to the public for this mistake?  We can’t change the past, we need to look towards the future. The best thing we can do is to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% as soon as possible.   To what extent have people lost trust in the ECB because of the high prices?  Surveys show that most people trust us to be able to bring inflation back down to 2%. That emerges clearly from measurable inflation expectations: households and firms expect inflation to fall back again soon.   Equity markets are rallying again, as investors are betting on inflation easing and on an imminent end to interest rate hikes.     Financial markets may well be overly optimistic with regard to inflation developments and our monetary policy response.   When will the interest rate hikes come to an end?   We increased our policy rates by 0.5 percentage points last week, and will very likely raise them by another 0.5 percentage points at our next meeting in March. We will then see what we will do. I would not rule out further rate hikes after March.  The battle against inflation is not over yet. In the euro area consumer prices still increased by 8.5% in January (considering an estimate for Germany), despite the fall-off in energy prices. At 5.2%, core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, is at its highest level in the history of the monetary union. That is not good.   Excessively high interest rates could damage the economy. Is the ECB in danger of going too far?   Our mandate is to maintain price stability. That’s it. That’s the only mandate we have. High inflation harms everyone in society.   Interest rate hikes act with a time lag. Have the measures had any visible effect at all so far?   Our interest rate policy takes one to two years to have an impact. But we are already seeing its initial effects: borrowing costs for households and businesses are rising, for example, and this is weakening demand for loans. In turn, that is helping to cool the economy and is leading to lower price increases.   A question on financial stability. The highly indebted conglomerate, Adani, is now under attack from a short seller. If Adani collapsed, it could take down the Indian banking system with it. Western banks are hugely exposed to it too. Are you worried about that?   We don’t comment on individual companies. Leaving that aside, European banks have proven to be very robust on average. Their profit margins shot up recently, making them more resilient, partly due to higher interest rates. On the other hand, the current economic slowdown could also have consequences. We are of course keeping a close eye on the non-bank financial sector, or shadow banks. Two years ago, for example, the difficulties at the private investment firm Archegos caused several banks to suffer major losses. We need to closely monitor risks like this. More generally,  we basically see two main risks for financial stability in the euro area. For one thing an overoptimism in the financial markets about the inflation outlook and the monetary policy response, and for another a possible contradiction in the direction of fiscal and monetary policies.

2023-01-24,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andreas Kröner, Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andreas Kröner, Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe 24 January 2023  The guidance the ECB gave in December has been tested by markets recently. There seems to be some confusion about your next moves. Have markets got ahead of themselves?  Our December projections foresaw inflation above our 2% target until mid-2025. Given that inflation had already been high for some time, this triggered a further monetary policy adjustment. It was reasonable to increase rates in December and signal a similar step in February. But beyond February any unconditional guidance – that is, guidance unrelated to the economic outlook – would depart from our data-driven approach. Our December decisions were based on the projections available at that time. In March we will have new ones and should reassess the situation.  But don’t you think that the ECB should provide markets with guidance on the next moves?   Yes, but not unconditional guidance. We strive to be predictable, but the current situation does not require us to commit to a specific rate path for too long or without reference to the data. Commitments on future monetary policy over a long horizon were justified in the past (we called it “forward guidance”) when rates were at their lower bound, so that we could only act upon expectations of future rates by signaling that we would keep policy rates low for long. But we are not in that situation anymore. Today we are fighting too-high inflation, and to do so we can bring rates as high as we deem appropriate to reach our target.  Also, there is too much uncertainty in the economy to unconditionally pre-commit to a specific policy course. There is uncertainty on the evolution of the war, on energy and food commodity prices and their pass-through to retail prices, on the reopening of the economy and its effects on supply chains, on the global economy (think of China and the United States), on the domestic economy (will we have a recession?), and on the impact of these developments on productive capacity.   So what should be your strategy in the current context?  We should provide clarity on, and be guided by, our reaction function, which is rooted in our price stability mandate and consists of two main elements. The first is the economic and inflation outlook: we will react to medium-term inflation remaining above our target. The second is the risks surrounding this outlook, today mainly related to the possible emergence of second-round effects: we want to prevent a de-anchoring of inflation expectations or the start of a wage-price spiral.   What will then determine your next moves?  It will be the economy, of course, and how its evolution will affect the two elements of our reaction function. Depending on this assessment, we may decide that more or less tightening is needed compared to what we envisaged in December. We should thus not be surprised that investors adjust their expectations of future rates as new data emerge. But we need to make our own reading of these data clear to them.  Your projections foresee a rapid inflation fall in 2023. But for 2024 and 2025 you have revised your inflation projections up, above your 2% target.   You are right. The December 2022 Eurosystem staff projections foresee that inflation will drop sharply, from 8.4% in 2022 to 3.6% by the end of 2023, mainly reflecting lower energy prices. But it will then stay at around 3.4% in 2024 and will reach 2% only in the third quarter of 2025.   So energy prices are falling but inflation will still remain above your target. What is behind this evolution?   In 2024 and 2025 projected inflation remains above target for two main reasons. The first one is that the projections assume that wages will pick up in the coming months.  So far, the combination of fast-rising prices and moderate wage growth has meant that workers have suffered a large loss in real income, shouldering most of the terms of trade “tax” that Putin has imposed on Europe. As a result, their share in income distribution has decreased. Over time we may see a rebalancing. But this would not necessarily signal the onset of a wage-price spiral. It may instead reflect a different allocation of the Putin “tax” between wages and profits, allowing a one-off catch-up in wages. This may be absorbed by firm mark-ups after their recent increase or through a fall in other input costs such as energy.   And what is the second reason?   The second reason is related to our staff’s judgement on the fiscal measures that aim to smoothen the effects of the energy shock. A good part of the upward revision of the December inflation projections for 2024 and 2025 reflects the fact that the price-based measures taken and announced by governments are expected to curb energy prices and inflation in 2023, when they are introduced. But they are expected to have the opposite effect when they are withdrawn, likely in 2024, pushing inflation up with carry-over effects in 2025, delaying the return to our target. The effect on inflation is in good part due to the fact that most of these fiscal measures are not limited to vulnerable population groups, but rather provide generalised support that is, on balance, inflationary.     What is the implication?   My concern is that this effect of fiscal measures – which is included in our baseline projection – is largely the result of judgement and is surrounded by very high uncertainty. Discretionary fiscal policy is hard to predict. For example, spending on energy support will likely be lower if energy prices continue to decline – indeed, last week the German government made an announcement of this sort, saying that falling prices could lower its spending on energy price brakes.  And importantly, this interaction between monetary and fiscal policies is highly inefficient. The risk is that fiscal measures that were introduced to shelter consumers from high energy bills and protect their purchasing power could, paradoxically, trigger a contractionary monetary policy reaction that would hit the real economy, reducing households’ incomes and increasing the interest bill for governments. It would be like giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  How can this be avoided?   Governments may decide to revise their measures, for instance by moving towards income-based, targeted support to vulnerable citizens, to avoid those undesirable oscillations of inflation. Some Member States are considering this possibility. This could make an important difference for monetary policy, reducing the cost of bringing inflation down. And it would benefit public finances, by lowering governments’ cost of borrowing.  What are the new economic developments since December?   We had some good news on the inflation front, as it is likely that the supply shocks that have hit the economy in recent months are starting to reverse. We can afford to be “anxiously optimistic”, but we should be prudent and remain vigilant.  Energy inflation might abate further if the recent fall in wholesale electricity and gas prices – which have so far declined by more than we had assumed in December – is sustained and reflected in retail prices, which typically takes a while. Lower energy prices are unambiguously good news: good for the economy and good for inflation. They bring down realised inflation and contain the loss in real income, reducing the risks of second-round effects and supporting economic sentiment.  How long will it take before citizens can see tangible signs of improvement?   It will take time, and we may see ups and downs, but some positive signs on the inflation front are emerging. For example, the seasonally adjusted three-month inflation rates (which capture the latest dynamics of inflation) have decreased in recent months as regards not only headline but also core inflation. Other recent developments could support this trend: the euro has appreciated by 6% versus the dollar since our December projections, while the adjustment in our policy stance is contributing to tightened financing conditions. Lending to firms and households is slowing. All these elements will play an important role in the March projections.   So, can we say that monetary policy is prevailing over inflation?   Not yet. As I said, it will take time before the developments I just mentioned are fully reflected in retail prices. Moreover, they could stop or reverse, while the recent improved economic data will support core price pressures. And we remain far away from our target. We need to continue closely monitoring the economic and inflation outlook.   In sum, what are the implications for monetary policy?  We must live with uncertainty and be prepared to adjust our monetary policy stance. Inflation is still too high, but recent developments suggest that we can fend off the risks of second-round effects and bring down inflation by continuing to adjust our policy rates in a well-calibrated, non-mechanical way.  Monetary policy operates with lags, which means that the effects of the fastest tightening in the ECB’s history have not even started to be fully felt. We need to take those lags into account to avoid having to reverse course, which would be costly given the lower flexibility of the euro area economy compared to economies like the US. We need to keep our policy dependent on incoming information, providing markets with the necessary conditional guidance on the basis of our reaction function. We should do all that is necessary to bring inflation down to 2% without undue delay, at the minimum cost to the economy.   On the basis of your analysis, what should be the next ECB policy move? A rate hike of 25 or 50 basis points?   I am happy to discuss my reading of the economy and my views of the broad implications for our monetary policy. But a detailed, public discussion of actual policy measures – a discussion of basis points – would be inappropriate. That discussion should take place within the Governing Council of the ECB.  In your home country Italy, the ECB's December decisions have been criticised. What do you think of that?  It is important to emphasise that countries with higher debt – both those with high public debt, and those with high private debt – benefit the most from a credible fight against inflation. After all, it is precisely in these countries that low inflation leads to low compensation for inflation risk (the inflation risk premium) and thus also low yields on bonds. In the past two decades, euro area sovereigns generally enjoyed low funding costs, despite rising debt-to-GDP ratios in a number of countries, largely thanks to the ECB’s ability to preserve price stability.   So you do not see monetary policy as a source of risk for Italy?  Not really. Italy’s fiscal policy has remained prudent. Rising interest rates had already been factored into the budget plan; and current market conditions are even slightly more favourable than those foreseen in the budget. Moreover, the average maturity of Italian public debt is equal to 7.8 years. This means that an unexpected increase in market yields would have a very limited impact on Italy’s interest bill in 2023. And let’s not forget that growth is the main driver of debt reduction. Italy grew by more than expected in 2022, and above the euro area average. Looking ahead, it can still invest significant resources – about 9% of GDP – thanks to the Next Generation EU. This makes it difficult to imagine a country risk if the path is followed.  Let's move on to a different topic: the digital euro. To what extent can the ECB make decisions about this on its own?  This is a highly political project and the ECB will not move on its own. We are coordinating closely with co-legislators. The European Commission will put forward a legislative proposal in spring this year, which will be discussed by the Member States and the European Parliament.   What points have been clarified so far?  One thing is clear: we are preparing ourselves to make public money available in digital form while still offering it in physical form – we will continue to offer cash. As with cash, we want to ensure that everybody in the euro area has easy access to the digital euro. To this end, we will work with supervised intermediaries such as banks, as they are best placed to interact with end users. We are designing the digital euro with the highest possible level of privacy. The ECB will have no access to personal data.   In many countries, it is already common to pay digitally. Who needs a digital euro anyway?   In the euro area, it is currently not guaranteed that everyone can pay everywhere with a single means of payment. Cash cannot be used for online payments, and existing digital solutions cannot be used in all countries. The digital euro is a natural step forward for our single currency: it would overcome the fragmentation of payments within the monetary union, through a means of payment that is ultimately governed by Europeans.  It is also important that citizens who prefer to pay digitally should have the option to pay with central bank money. This is a matter of sovereignty. And the digital euro would provide a monetary anchor that allows everyone to be sure that one euro is always one euro, as any form of money, such as bank deposits, can always be converted to riskless central bank money, be it cash or a digital euro.  But the digital euro also entails risks: if during a financial crisis people quickly exchange their bank deposits for digital euros, the crisis will be even greater.  We will make sure that a digital euro does not create financial stability risks. It will be designed to enable an upper limit to be set for digital euro holdings, although no decision has been taken yet on the precise amount. We want the digital euro to be a means of payment, not a form of investment.  And what happens if someone receives digital euros but their limit is already exhausted?  Then the amount in excess would be automatically converted into a deposit held in a bank account chosen by the recipient.  Technically, will the digital euro be based on a blockchain, similar to bitcoin?  We have not decided, because technology should follow functionality. Also, it is unclear whether a decentralised solution like the blockchain could cope with the volumes that could be generated. We are currently conducting market research to gather views on possible technological solutions. In any case, our infrastructure will bear no relation to bitcoin, which is not money and relies on a technology that is highly inefficient and devours huge amounts of energy.   Which questions in the concept are still open?  For example, whether it can be used outside the euro area and if so to what extent. There are calls to make the digital euro usable worldwide. But even if we limit holdings to, say, €3,000 per person, that could generate financial tensions in the domestic financial systems of some countries outside the euro area.  Who should bear the costs for the digital euro, the citizens?  No, our working assumption is that its use will be free of charge for consumers, similar to banknotes. There could be cost compensation flows similar to those applying to card payments between the bank of the merchant and the bank of the payer, and there could be a merchant fee. We are discussing these questions with the Commission.  Your term of office runs until the end of 2027. Do you think the digital euro will be realised in that time?  For all the enthusiasm I have for the project, no decision has been made yet on whether the digital euro will be issued. In any case, the preparations will still take a few years.   But you already believe that the project promises success?  I want the digital euro to be successful, not dominant. It should complement rather than replace other payment methods. We want to offer a public good to citizens, which will coexist with other means of payment including cash. Citizens will then decide if they want to use it. We thus need to make it attractive to them by guaranteeing convenience, privacy, efficiency and safety.   "
2023-01-17,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Wolf on 12 January 2023 ","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Wolf on 12 January 2023  17 January 2023  From your perspective, how much do you see the big rise in inflation as having been due to a supply shock or a demand shock, globally and also within the eurozone?  The way to think about the last two years is that this supply versus demand question has to be addressed at a sectoral level. We clearly have a supply shock in energy; and the pandemic had previously led to a supply shock in contact-intensive services. But there have also been two sectoral demand shocks: one was for goods, because there was a big switch towards consumption of goods; and then the post-Covid reopening took the form of a demand shock for services, notably in Europe. You have to take account of this sectoral differentiation. In Europe, we do not have a big rise in overall demand. But we have had this global mismatch in goods, which led to bottlenecks, and then, over the past year, a reopening effect on demand for services. So, this is why we at the ECB say there are both demand and supply channels at work. But it’s best not to view these at the aggregate level.  Isn’t it also true that the impact on prices of strong demand elsewhere — in the US, for example — will look like a supply shock to you?  There’s a large global component to inflation. Let me slightly broaden the point. On one level, the big increase in global prices of commodities and goods clearly reflect global demand and supply. But, since Europe is a big producer of manufactured goods, that has also boosted export prices for European firms. So, it’s not just that the prices of imported goods have increased. Europe has also been a beneficiary of high demand for its exports. We see that in cars and in luxury goods. And so, even though Europe has suffered a lot from high import prices for energy over the past year, there’s been a partial offset via higher export prices.  There are two views on what has happened.   One is we’ve had a series of unexpected shocks to the world economy: the pandemic; then the swift opening, which brought unbalanced demand; and then the energy shock. So, the world went crazy and we’ve simply done our best to manage it.   The other view is that monetary policy fuelled the flames, with a long history of ultra-loose monetary policy, followed by a gigantic monetary expansion in the early period of the pandemic. And this was then made worse by huge fiscal expansions, notably in the US. So, the central banks and fiscal authorities bear the blame for this.   How would you respond to these different views?  I’m going to be firmly in the first camp of essentially saying that we have had these very large shocks. For me the way to differentiate these narratives is that before the pandemic we had five years of low interest rates but little inflationary pressure. So, the idea that the world we lived in was creating an inflationary environment just doesn’t ring true. We did have very large quantitative easing and very low interest rates, and this did limit the disinflationary pressure, keeping inflation in the eurozone at around 1-1.5 per cent rather than allowing outright deflation. But we were not creating inflationary pressure. So, I don’t see that today’s inflation came out of excessively loose monetary policy. What is true, however, is that once these shocks had occurred it became important to move away from the super-loose monetary policy. If we had kept rates super low for too long, these might have translated into self-sustaining inflation. That’s why we have moved away from low interest rates and quantitative easing over the last number of months, when this inflation shock turned out to be fairly large and quite durable.  Again, there are two sides.   One says that most of this inflation is going to fade away, partly because the base effect of the high prices of a year before is going to lower annual inflation a great deal. Also, inflation expectations look well anchored and the labour market well behaved, at least in Europe. So, the real danger is that you are going to persist with tightening or “normalisation” for too long. Given the long and variable lags in monetary policy, you’re going to create an unnecessarily deep and costly recession.   So, that’s one side. But the other side, someone might say, is that many households are suffering a big negative shock to real incomes, which they are only [now] beginning to realise. So, there is a lot more labour market pressure to come and you are going to have to tighten a great deal and then stay there for a long time.   In other words, there are the risks of doing too much and too little, in a situation of extreme uncertainty. Which risk do you currently think is the bigger and on which side do you think the ECB should err?  These risks need to be taken seriously. But these have different prominence at different phases of the monetary policy cycle. The first phase for us was indeed to normalise monetary policy, to bring interest rates away from the lower bound towards something corresponding to neutral rates. We have done this. So, now we have the policy rate at around 2 per cent, which is in the “ballpark” of neutral. Yet we are still not where the risks become more two-sided or symmetric. So, we need to raise rates more. Once we’ve made further progress, the risks will be more two-sided, where will have to balance the risks of doing too much versus doing too little. This is not just an issue about the next meeting or the next couple of meetings, it’s going to be an issue for the next year or two. It’s important to remember that we meet every six weeks. We will have to make sure we take a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, to make sure we adjust to the evolution of the two risks. What does that mean? We have to keep an open mind on the appropriate level of interest rates. The big error would be maintaining a misdiagnosis for too long. The risk is not what happens in one meeting or in two meetings. What happened in the 1970s was a misdiagnosis over a long period of time. The issue here is flexibility in both directions to make sure that policy is adjusted in a timely manner, rather than maintaining a fixed view of the world for too long.  Are you reasonably comfortable, in retrospect, with the decisions you’ve made over the last couple of years? Do you feel that not only are you in a reasonable place, but that you’ve made sensible judgments?  Fundamentally, yes. Let me, first, give you a reminder of the last 15 months or so. Inflation pressures were starting to build from the summer of 2021. So maybe the first meeting at which this was sufficiently visible in the data would have been December 2021. But December 2021 was also when the Omicron variant was emerging. We did make an adjustment in December 2021 by firming up the ending of the PEPP (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme) from March 2022. Then, at the February 2022 meeting, we signalled a faster pace of reduction in asset purchases. We got out of a very large programme of quantitative easing by June 2022. And then we started hiking in July. So, what we did between December 2021 and June 2022 was focus on reducing QE, before starting to raise rates, in the knowledge that we could move relatively quickly once we started raising rates. The debate about the exact timing is misplaced, because we knew that we could always catch up if it turned out that rates needed to be moved more quickly. In the end, where we are now is reasonable. Any debate about whether we moved too slowly on rates has to be assessed in the context of being willing to move at a fast pace once we started hiking. This debate should not be about when exactly a central bank starts raising rates. After all, the yield curve jumps in anticipation of what we are expected to do and we’ve also proven an ability to move quickly. If you asked your readers a year ago what probability they would put on the ECB being at a 2 per cent policy rate by the end of 2022, I don’t think many would have bet on that. So, we’ve proven we are responsive and we’ve also proven our determination to deliver our inflation target. 2022 was a year of a big pivot, a big transition from accommodative towards restrictive policy. By the way, we do have a symmetric target. It was always important to demonstrate the symmetry. In the same way that we were active in fighting below-target inflation, we also have to be active in fighting above-target inflation.  How would you articulate the condition of the eurozone economy in comparison with the situation in the US?  US inflation is clearly more of a textbook case, in that a lot of inflation is coming from the demand side. The labour market has been hot, with a lot of vacancies, limited labour supply and so on. And it’s clear that monetary policy is working to cool down the labour market in a classic way. We have a more complicated situation in the euro area, because a lot of the inflation is connected to a negative terms of trade shock. We have declining real incomes and falling real wages, and a big supply component to the inflation. Regardless of where the inflation comes from, one has a risk of “second-round” effects, in which high inflation gives rise to upward pressure on wages and profit mark-ups. Monetary policy has to ensure that the second-round effect doesn’t become excessive or persistent. The fact that we have a negative real income shock in Europe, which the US does not have because it’s an energy exporter as well as an importer, means that the scale of monetary policy tightening needed to adjust inflation to target is smaller in the euro area than in the US. We both have a 2 per cent inflation target. But delivering 2 per cent means that interest rates will differ substantially between us and the US.  One of the consequences of this divergence has been a fairly big rise in the dollar. Does this shift in the external value of the currency cause issues for your policymaking?  It’s on the list of factors we look at but it’s definitely not at the top of the list. The euro area is a continental-sized economy. But there is a spillover from global monetary policy, because the rate of growth in the global economy and the rate of price increases of global commodities and other tradable goods are globally determined. We also have to take into account the downward pressure on inflation from tightening by other central banks around the world, which generates weaker demand for our exports and lower import prices. But this is not particularly via the euro-dollar rate, but rather via the global dynamics for commodities and tradable goods.  There’s a debate over whether the inflation, the rise in interest rates, the tightening of monetary policy and the move away from ultra-loose monetary policy represents a temporary blip, a big blip, but still a blip. Alternatively, is this the point at which we are moving into a more “normal environment” with nominal interest rates well away from zero and real interest rates positive rather than negative?   Do you have views on this?  Let me strongly differentiate the nominal versus the real sides of this story. For me, there are three regimes: one, inflation chronically below target; two, inflation more or less on target; and, three, inflation above target. Before the pandemic we, in the eurozone, had inflation at around 1 per cent for many years. So markets believed that interest rates would be super-low indefinitely. And that can be self-sustaining, because expectations would rationally be that inflation remains below targeted in that scenario.  But I don’t think we’re going back to that. The inflation shock has proven that inflation is not deterministically bound to be too low. The narrative I often heard before the pandemic on the “Japanification” of the European economy has gone quiet. I think this will be a lasting result. So, if expectations have now re-anchored at our 2 per cent target, compared to being well below it, interest rates will go to the level consistent with that target, not back to the super-low rates we needed to fight below-target inflation. For nominal rates, that makes a big difference. On the second question you posed, which was on the equilibrium real interest rate, I would be in the agnostic camp. It’s not clear whether there will be a large movement in the equilibrium real rate. Let me point to a couple of indirect mechanisms here. One is that in the pre-pandemic period some of the anti-inflationary forces were coming from globalisation. There were also the anti-inflationary effects of the deleveraging and fiscal austerity after the global financial crisis and European sovereign debt crisis. It’s a fair assumption that globalisation is going to be different. At the very least, there will be more concern about the resilience of supply chains and so forth and also more concern for security. This means that inflation is going to be more sensitive to domestic slack and less to global conditions. How big an effect that will have is uncertain. But it is a structural change in the world economy. The other point is that we had deleveraging after the global financial crisis and the European sovereign-debt crisis. In a number of countries, households had to reduce their household debt. Also, we had a number of years when governments felt they had to run austere fiscal policies, or were forced to do so. This, too, was bad for aggregate demand.  In the pandemic, however, governments had to run big deficits. That spending was transferred to households and firms. Also, the pandemic created “forced savings”, because there was less opportunity to spend. So, household balance sheets look better now than before the pandemic. So one factor that will be different now is the globalisation process. A second factor is where we are in terms of the balance sheets of the private sector and the governments. Governments will have to pull back from the high level of fiscal support they offered during the pandemic. But by and large it should be a normalisation of fiscal policy rather than a sudden stop in fiscal support. The fact that households have better balance sheets now also means that support for aggregate demand will probably be stronger after the pandemic than before the pandemic.  So this inflation shock has got rid of this environment of self-reinforcing low inflation and this is, to some degree, a relatively benign outcome.  You can classify it as a by-product of this shock. It has reminded the world that inflationary shocks can happen. And we absolutely see that in our surveys. If we go back to a year and a half ago, most of the distributions of inflation expectations were below 2 per cent. As you know, expectations have a strong effect on medium-term inflation and, as a consequence, on steady-state interest rates. So, yes, absolutely, I don’t think the chronic low-inflation equilibrium we had before the pandemic will return.  So, we might have inflation at target, monetary policy credible at delivering the inflation target, and a continuation of low real interest rates. In an economy with a lot of debt, this sounds like an ideal combination.  Well, it is important to recognise that it still requires work. We’re not yet at the level of interest rates needed to bring inflation back to 2 per cent in a timely manner. Governments also do need to pull back from the high deficits that remain. So, a significant fiscal adjustment will be needed in coming years. But, that adjustment should be a return to some normal situation, as opposed to a forced overcorrection.  In the first years of the euro, big imbalances were built up. Then there was a painful correction from 2008 until about 2015 or 2016. I don’t think that this high volatility will be repeated on this occasion. It’s more a question of returning from this unusual pandemic situation to a more normal state of affairs. We haven’t seen “normal” in Europe for a long time.  Where do you think interest rates might end up before this is over?  Here I’m going to repeat the point about data dependence. We’re working under very high uncertainty. Let’s just take one concrete example: compared to where we were in mid-December, when we had our last meeting, there have been big declines in energy prices. A lot of that has to do with mild weather in recent weeks. So, this is a simple example of why we must be open about where interest rates need to go. It’s still the case now in mid-January, that we run many scenarios about where interest rates are going to need to go. Under most of them, the vast majority of them, interest rates rates do have to be higher than they are now. As we discussed earlier, risks are not yet two-sided, and under a wide range of scenarios, it’s still safe to bring interest rates above where they are now. And this was the communication at our last meeting. Where exactly we end up will depend on a lot of factors. Let me go back to one thing you said earlier on, mechanical base effects mean that we do have inflation coming down a lot this year. So, for Q4 2023, our projection of inflation back in December 2022 was that we would be at around 3.6 per cent. Compared to being at 9 per cent at the end of 2022, that’s a fairly big decline. But it is mostly base effects. And then, in terms of interest rates, the question is how do you get from mid-threes at the end of 2023 to the 2 per cent target in a timely manner? That’s where interest rate policy is going to be important. It’s to make sure that the last kilometre of returning to target is delivered in a timely manner. So, what I would also say is that because we haven’t had so many tightening cycles in recent memory, another source for uncertainty is that the sensitivity of inflation to interest rates varies a lot across the different models we run. And this is why we would say, and the Fed would also say, that one of the big issues for this year is to observe the impact of the tightening we’ve already done. Last year we could say that it’s clear that we need to bring rates up to more normal levels, and now we say, well, actually we need to bring them into restrictive territory. But in terms of deciding where eventually the level is going to be, there will be a feedback loop from experience. What we would expect to see in the coming months is the impact of the interest rate hikes that happened last year for investment and consumption. In turn, that will help us decide how powerfully the interest rate hikes are affecting the real economy and the inflation dynamic. Anyone who says they know for sure what the right level of interest rates will be must, apart from everything else, have a lot of confidence in their model of how the world works. The prudent approach is, instead, to observe the feedback from the tightening last year. The policy rate only moved in the summer but the yield curve has been moving for a year. We are seeing the effects of this in the behaviour of banks, the bond market and the financial system. The interesting phase now is the response of firms, households and governments to the change in financial conditions.  Let me move on to “market fragmentation”, or divergences in monetary conditions across member states. How significant a risk do you think this is? And do you have the tools needed to manage it?  So, let me give you a two-level answer to that. The first level is that the biggest risk of fragmentation occurs when you have economic conditions that are misaligned across the EU area. And this is what we had prior to 2008. Because we had large differences in growth rates, current account deficits and credit conditions, in that first decade of the euro, many indicators showed a lot of divergence. And when the crunch came, the countries that needed to make a correction were going to have a number of years of difficult economic circumstances — low growth rates and shrinking economies. Those are the conditions in which risk of financial fragmentation would be most intense. A lot of measures were taken to reduce those fundamental differences. We have not seen large current account deficits in recent years, we have not seen large differences in fiscal deficits and we have not seen large differences in credit conditions. So, we do not have the ingredients for big divergence now, though this can always recur in the future, because there could be bad luck or bad policy choices. And let me add that during the pandemic, Europe also launched NextGenerationEU. So, there’s now jointly funded debt directed at the economies which suffered most in the pandemic. This is now going to be a big platform for reform and public investment in countries like Italy, Spain, Greece and so on. That’s one level.  The second level is that over the past year there has been a significant change in the nominal and inflationary environment. That might have caught some investors by surprise. In the process of normalisation, there’s always the risk that there could be market accidents, there could be non-fundamental volatility.  That is why we found it important to introduce an extra instrument — the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) — last summer. And that adds to our toolkit. Because we now have an ex-ante programme. We have told the world that if we see non-fundamental volatility emerging we will be prepared to intervene, subject to a set of “good governance” criteria, which means that affected member countries are aligned with the European frameworks. In sum, in terms of fundamental forces of volatility or divergence, Europe looks to be in reasonably good shape, and in terms of non-fundamental volatility, which is a more elevated risk in a time of transition, we have expanded our toolkit, by having the TPI.  There are people who note that we are experiencing a considerable change in the monetary environment for the financial sector. So, there is discussion about potential risks of financial instability. How do you perceive that in the ECB?  Since the start of unconventional monetary policy it was clear that there was a potential risk. What happens if there’s a sudden change in the interest rate environment? So, in principle that is a risk factor. It has been greatly mitigated in the European context not just by banks, but also by individuals. There has been a lot of “macroprudential” regulation, in terms of limits on loan-to-value ratios, limits on debt-to-income ratios and so on. The ability to exploit super-low interest rates via excessive leverage might have existed in some pockets, but it was not pervasive. The evidence is that we’re not seeing very high vulnerability to the big change in interest rates. In the less regulated non-bank sectors of the financial system, losses may have accumulated. But we have a bank-based financial system and the banks are heavily supervised and regulated. For banks, rising interest rates help via some channels, such as net interest income. To the extent that the European economy is hurt by the slowdown, they face some risks in their loan books. But again, we think the European economy will be growing again in 2023. Our current assessment is that if there is a recession, it’s going to be mild and short lived. So, I’ll be cautiously optimistic that we’re able to make this transition away from “low for long” towards a more normal situation. But again, let me go back to the running theme of this conversation, which is high uncertainty. If it turns out that inflation is much stickier than expected, that there’s more of a downturn in the world economy, that higher interest rates have to be higher than is currently expected by the market, we will be keeping a perpetual eye on financial fragility.  One other question about credibility. Let’s assume you’re correct that inflation will go back to target. Nonetheless, there will have been quite a jump in the price level. So, people will have suffered permanent losses on nominal assets. They might then say “well, this has shown us that big jumps in the price level can happen”.   People may say to themselves “well, maybe they’re going to do this to us again and so maybe we should be cautious about owning these sorts of assets”. And a big part of monetary stability is designed to make people feel confident that these assets are reliable in terms of their real value.  There are two parts to that analysis. One is whether, after this period of high inflation, the 2 per cent inflation target will be seen as credible by people in general. I think monetary policy can deliver that, by making sure inflation comes back to 2 per cent in a timely manner. But then, there is the second part, which is the implications for nominal assets and what assets people may wish to hold and what one means by the safety of “safe assets” after this inflation surprise? When you think about it, for me, it’s going to be more of a forward-looking question. First of all, I’m not going to disagree with you. Before the pandemic we had a negative inflation-risk premium. Interest rates were low not just because inflation was below target, but the risk distribution was seen as skewed to the downside. We would now expect to see an inflation risk premium being more substantial. People rationally update their beliefs about the world. It’s 40 years since we’ve seen this happen. And then the question is: how would that risk premium be priced? Is it going to be seen as a once in 40-year kind of risk factor? And with that kind of frequency, it’s not going to have that much effect. But, as you know, these kinds of rare events are priced by the market, to some extent. And we may see more of an inflationary risk premium, maybe more demand for index-linked products and so on. And that’s an open question.  Can you comment briefly on fiscal policy and its relationship to monetary policy — an issue Mario Draghi talked about quite a bit — as well as the fiscal policy framework, which is being discussed again by Eurozone governments.  This is a multilevel debate. In the end, everything has to be anchored on sustainable debt levels. If debt levels are, in the medium-term, anchored at a moderate level, governments can respond aggressively to large shocks, such as the pandemic or the energy shock. So, any fiscal framework should be embedded in a clear debt anchor. Politically, it’s not easy to deliver a strategy that will reduce debt ratios over time. But it is essential.  Let me add that a lot of the fiscal support in Europe consists of price subsidies, which are different from broad-based increases in government spending or broad-based reductions in taxes. The direct impact of fiscal policy is to lower inflation right now. But in our projections, it is expected to raise inflation in 2024 and 2025 when these subsidies are scheduled to be removed. So, when you look at what’s happening now, there are two different conversations. One is how fiscal policy is currently lowering inflation through subsidies, followed by the reversal of those subsidies later on. The other is the broader issue about the appropriate level of fiscal support in the economy. And what I said earlier on is true. We need to get to a normal situation where fiscal policy is not excessively loose. Because it’s hard to say you need expansionary fiscal policy when we have low unemployment. But we also don’t want to get to an excessively austere fiscal policy which would be an excessive drag on the economy. So, as I said earlier, we have not had “normal” in Europe for a long time. We really should be setting up a system to deliver a normal, stable, macroeconomic environment, including a normal, stable fiscal policy.  Just on your first point, there are member countries, some of them important, which do have high debt levels both by historical standards and by most norms. You are implying that these should be lowered. Given relatively modest low structural growth rates, that’s quite a challenge, isn’t it?  Right, so we have to be forward looking about this. We have to have a situation where, there is consensus that debt ratios have to come down. And we do need a fiscal framework that supports governments in delivering a steady and sustained decline in debt ratios. It’s not going to be easy. But again, in order to have the room to be aggressive when you need to be, you need to return to safe fiscal positions when the opportunities arise.  What do you think of the arguments that have been put forward, by   Olivier Blanchard,   for example, that the 2 per cent target is too low. It pushes you to the zero-bound too easily. And so we should really have a slightly higher inflation target?  There’s a lot of value in the stability of the inflation target. So, for me, at this point, maintaining an exclusive focus on 2 per cent as the inflation target is the best strategy.  What is your view of the usefulness of a digital euro?  So, what I would say is that where we are now is abnormal. We have essentially a big move away from state-provided money in favour of private sector alternatives.  The anchor of the monetary system and the anchor of an electronic or digital monetary system should be a state-supplied digital currency. So, I’m very much in favour of having a digital currency. But, in the same way that currency is a relatively minor fraction of overall transactions, a digital euro is not intended to become the dominant way we transact. But a digital currency will allow Europe to have a more stable and secure digital economy. So, digital currency is necessary and desirable as an anchor for a generally digitalised economy.  But you do think this can be done without destabilising banks? And particularly bank deposits?  Absolutely. Yes, so it’s fair to say that the interest and the energy the ECB is putting into the digital euro is with conviction that this will not be a threat to the stability of the banking system.   "
2022-12-31,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Jutarnji List,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by Marina Klepo on 19 December 2022 <a id=""_Hlk123120839""></a>","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Jutarnji List   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by Marina Klepo on 19 December 2022    31 December 2022  Eight months after you became ECB President, the Croatian kuna and the Bulgarian lev were included in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II. After the shortest period in the ERM II of all new EU Member States, Croatia is now also about to join the euro area. Was such an outcome a surprise for you?   I will focus on Croatia, which is becoming a new member of our family. I believe it has achieved exceptional success and that is big news. Being able to do all that – covering all the areas within a period of ten years between accession to the European Union and euro area entry – is an incredible success. Croatia has implemented reforms and the necessary restructuring and done everything to continue to have sound public finances. So it fully deserves to be admitted to the euro area on 1 January 2023, and it is wonderful to welcome the 20th member to the family when we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of euro banknotes and coins. This is big news and a reason for all of us to celebrate!   Over the past few years, people in Croatia have had a chance to hear a lot of arguments in favour of introducing the euro, but the most prominent ones – such as lower interest rates and more favourable borrowing terms – have become less convincing due to a change in circumstances. People worry that the euro will only spur inflation. To what extent have these new circumstances changed the narrative in terms of the costs and benefits of introducing the euro?   It is good to have the euro because it can operate as a shield. Once a euro area country, always a euro area country. All for one and one for all. We are together in this, all soon-to-be 20 euro area countries. I am old enough to remember when France became a member of the euro area and we exchanged the franc for the euro. We were also worried that abandoning our currency and adopting the common currency might have grave consequences in terms of higher prices and less independence. However, looking back on 23 years of the euro and 20 years of euro banknotes and coins, we can say that it has paid off – the euro has brought protection and strength. The initial concern that prices will be a little higher can be allayed. I am certain that the Croatian government has taken the necessary steps, such as ensuring prices are clearly displayed in both kuna and euro. In France, too, we were able to monitor the prices in both francs and euro for about half a year. It is a really good way of providing information because it is difficult, especially for elderly citizens, to switch to another currency all of a sudden. I believe that pocket calculators (or apps for the younger generation) displaying the price of a desired product in both currencies are useful in that process, as they were to us in France. I also trust that there are arrangements in place to punish those who abuse the system, who take advantage of the conversion to raise prices. There must be a combination of measures in place to facilitate the conversion while, at the same time, not allowing it to result in difficulties for citizens.   A deterioration in loan conditions seems inevitable?   Interest rates are increasing for everyone. At the moment, ECB policy rates must be higher to curb inflation and bring it down to our target of 2%. That process is essential because it would be even worse if we allowed inflation to become entrenched in the economy. So, we must do it now, but this is in no way connected to Croatia introducing the euro.   As interest rates increase, at least depositors should benefit?   We have a mandate to ensure price stability, and we have to fulfil it.  Even though Croatia is currently in a celebratory mood, it faces numerous challenges. While the ECB’s June Convergence Report said that Croatia fulfilled all the conditions for adopting the euro, one could also read warnings that its potential growth rate is low and that more should be done to ensure it catches up with the living standards of other Member States.  I would like to say two things. Croatia is already very well integrated in the euro area. If you look at the denomination of household or government debt, a high level of euroisation is evident. Second, Croatia is a very open economy. Looking at investment and tourism, the benefit of not having currency exchange operations is unequivocal. I have been to Dubrovnik, that wonderful Croatian city, and the fact that, in the future, people will not even have to think about the exchange rate or conversion fees will certainly foster tourism, which makes up a significant proportion of Croatian GDP (around 20%), as well as investment. Finally, people in Croatia have demonstrated that they are able to improve the country’s circumstances, that they can catch up with other countries, that they can take the steps necessary to become a member of the club. I see no reason for this to stop now. My only advice would be: do not stop or rest on your laurels, but continue to implement structural reforms. Being a member of the club means pressing on with reform efforts and catching up with others.   The past experience of some countries, like Greece with its debt crisis and even Slovenia with its banking crisis, indicates that members of the club easily overlook what is important to undertake on time.   Croatia is entering the euro area during a crisis period, but the country is weathering this crisis successfully. So it is a matter of going ahead with that process, using all the advantages brought by membership of the euro area.  Nevertheless, Croatia cannot be said to have been particularly successful in implementing structural reforms, despite having managed to fulfil all formal criteria for admission to the euro area and even the Schengen Area? For example, reforms of public administration, business climate, the healthcare system...   Membership of the club will surely encourage and help the authorities to implement the reforms. The country will benefit from it.  Accession to the euro area changes the definition of international currency reserves. A portion of reserves goes into the Eurosystem, but the largest portion remains within the competence of the Croatian central bank which believes that it needs to continue managing them. However, there are different positions on this in Croatia’s public sector, including using a portion of these reserves for other purposes such as repaying public debt. What do ECB procedures say on this, what practices were employed by other new members of the euro area?   This is a rather technical but important issue. When a country joins the euro area, its national central bank (NCB) needs to contribute both to the ECB’s capital and to its foreign reserves according to the capital key. The ECB foreign reserves are managed in a decentralised way by the euro area NCBs. The related income is recorded in the ECB’s profit and loss account, and will also benefit Hrvatska narodna banka, in addition to the other NCBs, who are shareholders of the ECB. Furthermore, each central bank is credited by the ECB with a euro claim equivalent to its contribution, which is remunerated by the ECB. Foreign reserve assets beyond this will remain on Hrvatska narodna banka’s balance sheet.  How do you currently view the economic situation in the euro area to which Croatia is being admitted? An increasing number of indicators suggest that the energy crisis may be less difficult than was thought a few months ago, so the recession could be short-lived and mild?  According to the December Eurosystem staff projections, the recession we feared is likely to be short-lived and shallow. We revised down our GDP projections for 2023 from 0.9% previously, and we now expect 0.5% growth. However, 2024 and 2025 will see a recovery and a return to previous growth rates. All these projections are based on an assumption of no additional shocks or worsening of the difficulties we are facing. There is a big “if”, and in the past 12 months we have witnessed risks ultimately materialising. When it comes to inflation, projections for the entire horizon have been revised upward, which is also the reason for raising interest rates, as well as for anticipating further rate hikes. An important factor in this respect is that we must not allow inflationary expectations to become de-anchored or wages to have an inflationary effect. We know wages are increasing, probably at a faster pace than expected, but we must be wary that they do not start fuelling inflation.   Obviously, the three important words “whatever it takes” apply almost equally to inflation as they did to the euro?  We have to take the necessary measures to return to our target inflation rate of 2%.   There are doubts as to the extent to which monetary policy can do that, given that the main cause of inflation is not consumption but rising energy prices and disruptions to global value chains?  We have to show resilience in the face of persistent inflation and we must be careful in considering not only its symptoms but also its roots. What is causing inflation? It used to be predominantly supply-side driven. But now we need to be careful that the domestic causes that we are seeing, which are mainly related to fiscal measures and wage dynamics, do not lead to inflation becoming entrenched.  What is your position on views that a deeper recession will be essential for curbing inflation?  Our staff, that is the ECB in Frankfurt and 19 NCBs (soon to be 20 including Hrvatska narodna banka), do not forecast a deep recession. As I explained before, we forecast 0.5% GDP growth for next year and 1.9% and 1.8% for 2024 and 2025 respectively. These are the conclusions reached by economic experts based on comparisons and harmonisation of numerous data. Croatia will also take part in that process as of next year.   In a way, the Croatian central bank Governor Boris Vujčić is a declared “hawk”; he believes that inflation growth comes at a higher cost than a temporary GDP decline and advocates more aggressive interest rate hikes and earlier quantitative tightening. Can you briefly explain the process of Governing Council decision-making and how consensus is reached?   First of all, I would like to say that I am very cautious when it comes to stories about birds. I have had the opportunity to see hawks turn into doves, doves turning into hawks... These are just stories. What matters is that the circumstances, the difficulties we are facing and the type of inflation we are fighting are inevitably changing people’s perspectives. All members of the Governing Council have different experiences and educational backgrounds, they come from different schools of thought and bring those views with them.  How does the process work? There are discussions at both committee and Executive Board level in preparation for the monetary policy meeting. The ECB chief economist presents the proposal to the Governing Council. One key input is the staff projections by the ECB or in cooperation with euro area NCBs, which are prepared four times a year. Then, members of the Governing Council have a discussion on the proposal put forward by the chief economist. Following a lot of reflection and discussions among the members of the Governing Council we arrive at a decision, which becomes the monetary policy for the entire euro area. This is then presented by me and the Vice-President at a press conference. Afterwards the decisions are explained by members of the Governing Council in their own jurisdictions.   How do you see the process of euro area expansion looking ahead? Some countries are not overly interested in adopting the euro, even though surveys show the majority of non-Member States except the Czech Republic being in favour?  Over a 24-year period, between 1999 and 2023, the euro area will have grown from 11 to 20 members, which is a clear indication that the club is attractive. Second, of the 27 Member States, with the exception of Denmark which has negotiated an opt-out, only six EU Member States are not members of the club. If they need more time, that is fine. When they meet the criteria and wish to join, we will be happy to increase the number of euro area countries, which is the ultimate goal of the Treaty.   Do you believe there are economic or political reasons in the background?  It is difficult to say, but it is probably a combination of both.    "
2022-12-27,Luis de Guindos,Interview with the Spanish Confederation of Young Entrepreneurs’ Associations (CEAJE),"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted on 16 December 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with the Spanish Confederation of Young Entrepreneurs’ Associations (CEAJE)   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted on 16 December 2022 27 December 2022  How do you see Spain in terms of entrepreneurship at European level? What’s the situation at present?  The situation we find ourselves in is truly unique owing to the huge uncertainty it brings. When the economy seemed to be reopening after two years of the pandemic and severe supply chain issues – which are still ongoing – war broke out in Europe, triggering another major crisis. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not only a human tragedy that we all hope can be brought to an end as soon as possible, but it is also having a clear impact on the economy and, by extension, on investment and entrepreneurship. However, the euro area, including the Spanish corporate sector, has recovered well from the impact of the pandemic, especially the services sector, and has shown resilience in the face of the current higher energy and financing costs. The measures taken during the pandemic, such as the Next Generation EU funds currently being paid out, have supported this recovery. Spain is one of the main beneficiaries of the programme. And as I have said before, I think Spain always provides a positive surprise. The results published in the latest RED GEM España report, which measures Spain’s entrepreneurial activity, confirm that entrepreneurship has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels and that female entrepreneurship is also on the rise.  What would you say are the future challenges facing companies in Spain? What should their main objective be?  The current economic environment of high inflation, low growth and tighter financing conditions poses considerable challenges for firms across the euro area and is affecting their overall competitiveness. Moreover, the European economy faces two major tests in the coming years: digitalisation and the transition to a greener and more sustainable economy, which will be key to mitigating the effects of climate change. The energy crisis is likely to have accelerated shifts in relative prices, which are here to stay. These price signals are crucial to incentivise energy saving and foster green investment, which could also create new opportunities. In addition, it is also vital that, throughout this process, businesses do not lose sight of the importance of diversity and inclusion at all levels.  How do you see Spain in terms of business internationalisation in the short/medium term?  Spain is one of the four largest economies in the euro area. Its business landscape and international competitiveness are very important and beneficial for Europe as a whole. I think that the future and success of European and Spanish firms will depend on the extent to which they can adapt and identify opportunities in the current environment and respond to current challenges like, as I said before, digitalisation and the transition to a more sustainable economy.  It seemed that businesses were starting to see the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel when the war broke out in Ukraine. How is it affecting our economy and, more specifically, young people starting their own businesses?  We are currently in a very difficult economic situation. The high inflation rates that we are seeing across Europe are coinciding with an economic slowdown and low growth. This situation undoubtedly presents a challenge for businesses and their sustainability. With a recession on the horizon, the current high uncertainty makes it all the more difficult for businesses and entrepreneurs to distribute their capital. So, against this backdrop, it is very important to be prudent.  Has inflation already peaked or is a colder than expected winter on the cards for Spanish firms and households?  Our latest macroeconomic projections, which we published on 15 December, show that the euro area economic outlook has deteriorated, with more persistent inflation than envisaged. Moreover, the ongoing energy crisis, elevated uncertainty, the global slowdown and tighter financing conditions are dragging down economic activity and have already led to a sharp slowdown in real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2022. Based on our calculations, we expect inflation to fall to our 2% target in the second half of 2025.  The ECB is now planning to raise interest rates further, which will make it difficult to access credit, and yet prices continue to increase. How high are interest rates going to go?  That is something we will decide meeting by meeting and on the basis of incoming data, given the current high uncertainty. As we announced this month, there will be further, necessary, rate hikes until inflation is on a path back to close to our 2% target.  The United Kingdom has already said that it is in recession. Is Spain heading the same way?  Our macroeconomic projections foresee a short-lived and shallow recession in the euro area at the end of the year. However, we expect the economy to return to positive growth rates from the second quarter of 2023 and for these to remain in 2024 and 2025.  What main actions would you advise Spanish people to take to cope with this situation? And what would your advice be for businesses?  In my view, in this current period of uncertainty and economic slowdown it is very important that individuals and businesses alike are prudent and focus on the long term.  Lastly, what would you say to all those young people who want to change the world but are still afraid to take a chance on their plans, even more so now with the instability that Spain and the rest of Europe are experiencing?  My advice for all young entrepreneurs is to persevere, and to always do so with caution, despite the challenges. And I would encourage all young people to study, learn languages and get to grips with new technology so as to be prepared for the future and able to better manage situations of uncertainty or instability.

2022-12-24,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gerald Braunberger and Christian Siedenbiedel on 16 December 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gerald Braunberger and Christian Siedenbiedel on 16 December 2022 24 December 2022  Ms Schnabel, among other things, 2022 is likely to go down in history as the year of high inflation. As one of the ECB’s Executive Board members responsible for monetary policy, does this trouble you?   I have been working intensely on how to tackle high inflation all year. The ECB’s mandate is to maintain price stability. With inflation at times exceeding 10%, we can hardly speak of price stability. That is why we are doing whatever is necessary to bring inflation back to our medium-term target of 2%.   Do you yourself feel the effects of the extremely high inflation in your daily life?   Sure, one notices that everywhere – when shopping, visiting a restaurant or paying the gas bill. But people on lower incomes are bound to feel those effects far more keenly; in many cases they have no savings to draw down and they are especially hard hit by the high prices for energy and food.   When did you first have the impression that serious inflation lay ahead?  I noticed some warning signs early on. In a speech that I gave in July 2021, I presented a series of indicators pointing towards a rise in inflation. However, I did not go all the way in drawing the right conclusions. For a long time, we believed that many of the causes of inflation would vanish over time. Put simply, the 10% inflation that we observe today can be divided into two parts: the first 5% emerged in the year 2021 and the second in 2022. Inflation in 2021 had to do with the after-effects of the pandemic. After the economy reopened, demand rapidly took off and met a relatively inelastic supply, exacerbated by supply chain disruptions. This imbalance of supply and demand triggered the first surge in prices.   Though couldn’t we have expected a certain surge in prices after COVID-19?   Indeed, but many people underestimated the extent of it; they thought that the supply chain disruptions would be resolved more quickly. But that took much longer than expected. Inflation had already reached 5% at the end of 2021.   But it didn’t stop there...  Russia’s terrible war of aggression against Ukraine this year made matters worse by causing another price surge, particularly through rising energy and food prices. It was especially concerning that these price increases gradually broadened across the entire basket of goods. Not only energy prices rose steeply, but also core inflation, that is inflation stripped of the volatile prices for energy and food. By that time, it was clear to everyone that inflation would be more persistent.   You have an academic background, you were a professor on the German Council of Economic Experts. What is it like finding yourself in a situation for which no appropriate model seems to be available − at least not one that can be found offhand? That’s not a particularly comfortable place to be in as an economist, is it?   Models are available, but they are difficult to apply in practice. The challenge is to identify the causes of inflation, and the correct response, in real time. An important distinction is whether the shocks are driven by supply or demand. Monetary policy can deal effectively with demand-driven shocks. Higher interest rates temper demand and counter overheating. Unlike in the United States, however, the disruptions in the euro area were predominantly on the supply side. That makes it harder for monetary policy, as it cannot directly remove the causes for the price increase. If we knew that supply chain disruptions and the strong surge in energy prices would disappear quickly and that the high inflation would not spark any second-round effects, monetary policy would not have to react at all to such supply-side shocks because it would only take effect when the shock has already abated. But we are now seeing a whole series of such shocks, which raises the risk of second-round effects. At the same time, the robust labour market, fiscal policy and the savings accumulated during the pandemic are supporting demand.   Did the ECB make any mistakes during this process?   We underestimated the persistence of inflation and initially did not take the signs of higher inflation seriously enough – not least because we were coming out of a phase in which the main risk had been that of too low inflation. But let’s not forget that there was great uncertainty owing to the recurrent waves of the pandemic. There was a concern that premature action by monetary policy might unnecessarily push the economy into another recession.  The ECB has now raised interest rates four times. Will further interest rate increases now be more difficult to push through politically – especially if the inflation rate dips down in some months?  Since July, we have increased interest rates significantly at every meeting of the ECB Governing Council, often by more than expected. For some time, financial markets assumed that, at the first sign of a trend reversal of inflation, the ECB would stop raising rates forcefully. That is why our latest monetary policy decision was so important. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated unequivocally that we would continue raising interest rates for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our medium-term target of 2%. Financial markets reacted to this immediately. The terminal rate, which is the peak rate expected during the interest rate cycle, has risen above 3%. Whether we will still need to go higher than that will depend on the future inflation outlook.  Will interest rate hikes become trickier if the euro area enters a recession and if the US Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates at some point?   Interest rate hikes are rarely popular, as households, firms and governments are confronted with rising financing costs. At the same time, higher interest rates dampen economic activity. So we have to explain why what is initially perceived as harmful will provide stability and foster investment and growth in the longer term.   But we are now entering a phase in which it will be more difficult to reach any kind of unanimous agreement on how these different influences should be assessed. People may have good reasons for holding differing opinions. Wasn’t that why the ECB Governing Council found a compromise at its December meeting and only raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points while at the same time announcing a path of further interest rate hikes?   The aim was to clarify that the terminal rate may be higher than many market participants expected. How exactly that rate is achieved is then of lesser importance. What mattered is that we agreed that further interest rate hikes are necessary. ECB President Christine Lagarde is a master in achieving consensus. But that will certainly not get any easier in the future.   Italy has strongly criticised the most recent rate hikes. Do you suppose that the question of how to proceed will lead to more conflicts from this side in the future?   Governments generally don’t like interest rate hikes very much. They weigh on the fiscal position as it becomes more expensive for states to issue new debt. So we can expect increasing pushback and we need to withstand it. That’s exactly why central banks are independent.   Is there any scientific basis that indicates how much the ECB has to raise interest rates in order to fight inflation successfully?  All models are subject to considerable uncertainty. There are also factors that we cannot possibly predict. When will the war end? What will happen next with China’s reopening?  Former ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet has said that calculating a natural or neutral interest rate that neither subdues nor boosts economic activity does not make any sense for the eurozone, as the eurozone is far too heterogeneous. At the same time, the ECB has created the impression in the last few months that such a thing does exist. On further enquiry, we learned that it is actually more of a communication tool. Can you really sell that to anybody?   Estimates of the neutral interest rate are subject to considerable uncertainty. The neutral interest rate is therefore more of a conceptional framework than a tool that helps our actual decision-making. In any case, we clearly have to reach an interest rate that is high enough to bring inflation back down to 2%. According to our assessment, this interest rate lies in restrictive territory – that is, above the neutral interest rate – even if the exact level is yet unknown. This means that the inflation problem will not go away on its own.  Do you think that the ECB can overdo the interest rate increases?  Monetary policy works with a lag, meaning that most of its effects are observed only with a delay. The exchange rate reacts relatively swiftly – we are feeling the effects of this already. Inflation expectations, which influence wage negotiations and price setting, can also adapt rather quickly. However, the standard monetary policy transmission mechanism through the banking sector takes longer – around one to two years. We could end up overreacting if we were to only focus on the current rate of inflation. That is why we need models that give us an indication – in spite of all the uncertainty – as to how our interest rate increases affect the economy and inflation over the medium term. At the moment, however, the danger of overreacting continues to be limited, as real interest rates are still very low.   So do you still trust these longer term projections? Do you actually anticipate that inflation in 2025 will be 2.3%, as per your official stance?  The uncertainty for 2025 is high and we know that the models tend to project that inflation eventually returns towards 2%. This is due to the assumption of a credible central bank. Still, in our projections inflation remains notably above 2% over an extended period. As inflation expectations are strongly dependent on what people are actually experiencing, this can affect wage and price setting. A long phase of very high inflation – as we are currently seeing – is therefore problematic. It makes it all the more important for us to react decisively.  At its last meeting, the ECB Governing Council also decided to test reducing the asset purchase programme (APP) holdings from March, initially for four months. Why is the ECB being so cautious, and what risks do you anticipate?   Our primary monetary policy instrument in the current situation is the interest rate. It is the tool with which we want to reduce inflation. At the same time, such a large ECB balance sheet is evidently incompatible with the current inflation outlook. We need to reduce it gradually, ideally in a predictable way, quietly in the background. With such a measured approach, we want to avoid disruptions in the bond markets.  You recently experienced a more significant impact on your balance sheet owing to the repayment of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). To what extent can such steps be taken to reduce the likelihood of losses for central banks?  The TLTROs were granted at very low interest rates, at a time when no one expected interest rates to increase so soon and so strongly. When we started raising interest rates rapidly, it affected banks’ interest rates in a way that ran contrary to our monetary policy goals. The banks no longer had an interest in repaying the loans early and would have kept them until they matured. This made it necessary to change the conditions. So there was a clear monetary policy case behind it, even if it has side effects on the central banks’ profit and loss accounts. The same goes for the reduction in bond holdings.  Many governments are also currently trying to soften the effects of inflation. Are the fiscal measures taken by the euro area countries helpful in tackling inflation?   Governments need to protect the most vulnerable parts of society. However, the steps taken should be targeted and should not mute the price signals. Germany’s gas bill cap is a good example of how to maintain proper incentives. In addition, investments and structural reforms are necessary for fighting the root causes of inflation. Speeding up the green transition would make us less dependent on fossil fuels in the medium term. In reality, only a regrettably small share of the government measures in the euro area were targeted. The measures rarely maintained proper incentives, and there were next to no additional investments in the green transition. That is why many of these measures actually tend to fuel inflation in the medium term.   In June the ECB convened a special meeting as yields in Italy surged, but no special meeting has been called as a result of the surge in inflation. In the process of normalising monetary policy, did the ECB have to give extra consideration to countries that are heavily in debt?  We are in an extraordinary situation in which major central banks across the world are rapidly raising interest rates. Rising interest rates typically also lead to increases in risk premia. This is a normal process, which poses no problems as long as it plays out in an orderly manner. However, we know that disruptions in the bond market are more likely during such phases, and that we can only consistently pursue our path of interest rate hikes if we can at the same time make sure that there will be no disturbances in the bond market. That is why we are applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). Furthermore, we have established the transmission protection instrument (TPI) in order to ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries and to prevent a sudden surge in bond yields that is not justified by fundamental factors. It is this combination of measures that made our large interest rate steps feasible.   Since October the ECB has been taking climate criteria into account when reinvesting funds from its corporate bond purchases. How have these initial encounters with green monetary policy been?   I would not call it “green monetary policy”. That makes it sound as if the primary goal of our monetary policy is climate protection. We have in fact discovered that our corporate bond portfolio contains a significant bias towards energy-intensive firms. In order to counteract this, we now take into account climate criteria when reinvesting funds from maturing bonds. We determine a climate score for firms whose bonds we buy. This reflects the firms’ emissions, their plans for lowering them and their transparency regarding climate risks. Therefore, we are partly buying different bonds than before, but this does not yet have a major effect on the portfolio as a whole. We cannot substitute for the climate policy of governments. But we can and we must – within our mandate – align our monetary policy with the EU’s climate objectives and thereby be a role model in financial markets.    "
2022-12-22,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Le Monde,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Éric Albert on 15 December and published on 22 December","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Monde   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Éric Albert on 15 December and published on 22 December 22 December 2022  What is your assessment of the euro area economy at the moment? Are we in a recession?  The indication for the fourth quarter of 2022 is that we are perhaps in negative territory, but not very deep, with GDP expected to contract by 0.2%. The lead indicators we have are not good. Our projections therefore expect the euro area to fall into a mild recession in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter of 2023, when GDP is expected to contract by 0.1%.   On that basis, why is the ECB tightening its monetary policy? On Thursday, 15 December you raised the deposit facility rate by 50 basis points to 2%, while ECB President Christine Lagarde announced at the press conference that there would be several further rate increases in 2023. Don’t you risk making the recession worse?  Look at our inflation projections. We published our projections in September then again in December. The change in our growth projections between the two is not big: they are slightly better than expected for 2022 (revised up from 3.1% to 3.4%), slightly lower for 2023 (revised down from 0.9% to 0.5%) and identical for 2024 (1.9%). But the substantial change concerns inflation, which has been revised up quite significantly (from 5.5% to 6.3% for 2023 and from 2.3% to 3.4% for 2024).  That’s true, but inflation appears to have peaked. In the euro area, it fell from 10.6% in October to 10.1% in November. With commodity prices falling, this trend should continue.  We think that over the course of the next two or three months inflation will be somewhere around its current level, then in the second quarter of next year it will see a drop to hover around 7% by the middle of the year. But that is still clearly above our price stability target, i.e. inflation of 2% over the medium term. We have no choice but to act.  But in acting you are stifling what little growth remains…  Monetary policy works by tempering demand, which in turn tempers growth, there is no alternative. If we do nothing, the situation would be worse because inflation is one of the factors behind the current recession. It reduces households’ disposable income and affects the most vulnerable members of society in particular. By reducing inflation, we’ll contribute to growth.   How far should the ECB go in raising interest rates? President Lagarde clearly stated on 15 December that the ECB intends to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting and perhaps by another 50 basis points at the meeting after that and possibly again at the next meeting after that, which would bring the deposit facility rate to 3.5%. Is that correct?  First, increases of 50 basis points may become the new norm in the near term. Second, we should expect to raise interest rates at this pace for a period of time. And third, our interest rates will then enter into restrictive territory. The steps we have taken so far are going to have an impact on inflation, but we still need to do more.      According to ECB projections, wages in the euro area are set to grow by 4.5% this year and by 5.2% in 2023. Do you see the risk of a wage-price spiral?  Wages are catching up, and I think that’s normal. Is it a wage-price spiral? Not at the moment. But it is very important that we don’t lose our credibility, that’s to say that inflation expectations do not start to become de-anchored. If households start thinking that the ECB is not doing enough, and they expect inflation to be 7% or 8% over the next three years, they would then ask for a pay increase of 7% or 8%, triggering the spiral. This would mean that we would have lost our credibility.  In the 1970s one of the reasons for the spiral was that wages were indexed to inflation. That’s practically no longer the case today, except in Belgium. Isn’t the situation completely different?  In the case of Belgium, and in the case of Luxembourg, indexation remains almost automatic. And if you look at Spain, figures from the Banco de España show that 25% of new wage agreements are now indexed to inflation. A year ago there were hardly any, so it’s a rising trend.  In raising interest rates, which slows the economy, you are going to make quite a few governments unhappy. Is this a test of your independence?  The best way to help governments is to reduce inflation. It is currently the main problem for many European countries. Admittedly, raising interest rates means an increase in funding costs for governments. But we have a mandate and we have to stick to it: inflation is currently at 10% and core inflation at 5%, whereas our target is 2%.  So you have no choice?  We have no choice, and I think not having the possibility to deviate from the target is a good thing. Because if we don’t control inflation, if we do not put inflation on a convergence trajectory towards 2%, it will be impossible for the economy to rebound.  You are also responsible for monitoring financial stability. What are you concerned about?  Financial stability conditions have deteriorated because of lower growth, higher inflation and the tightening of financial conditions. I am concerned that markets could underestimate the persistence of inflation. Euro area inflation has decreased from 10.6% to 10.1%, but that is not enough.  Furthermore, I am concerned that markets might consider fiscal policy to be incompatible with monetary policy, that there is a potential conflict. This is what happened in the United Kingdom in September. Finally, banks have a solid capital position and can withstand a shock. But I have a lot more doubts about non-banks, notably hedge funds. Their level of leverage is huge, they have highly illiquid assets and they have been accumulating risky assets. So an abrupt increase in rates could cause problems.    "
2022-12-06,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Milano Finanza,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Francesco Ninfole","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Milano Finanza   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Francesco Ninfole 6 December 2022  Has the euro zone reached peak inflation?  It’s probably too early to make that judgement, but I would be reasonably confident in saying that it is likely we are close to peak inflation. But whether this already is the peak or whether it will arrive at the start of 2023, is still uncertain. The main uncertainty is that we’ve seen so much volatility in gas prices. In some countries, consumer prices have moved a lot, while in others for example some utility companies have not yet finished hiking prices. Given the significant increase in prices, I don’t rule out some extra inflation early next year. Once we are past the initial months of 2023, later on in 2023 – in the spring or summer – we should see a sizeable drop in the inflation rate. That said, the journey of inflation from the current very high levels back to 2% will take time.  Next year, will inflation go down to 6-7%?  The initial downshift from the current high rates will be to around that level but I would expect further reductions throughout next year.  Is it possible that core inflation will go up while headline inflation goes down?   This could happen, because a big driver of core inflation at the moment is the fact that many sectors across the economy, such as transportation and tourism, use a lot of energy, so when there is a high increase in their energy costs, they have to raise the prices of the services and goods they sell, and then core inflation rises. A second factor has also been the recovery in demand in the last six months, since the lifting of the pandemic restrictions. However, this second factor should play only a minor role next year, when the reopening phase of the economy is over and expenditure settles back into a more normal pattern. A third factor is that wages will be increasing, adding to costs across the economy.  As regards the medium-term prospects for inflation, the ECB has predicted an inflation level of 2.3% in 2024. Will inflation be closer to 2% in 2025, and in the medium term, when most of the pandemic and war-related factors have faded away, will there be more of an upside or downside risk to inflation?  Typically, you could expect inflation to get closer to our target with extra time. One reason is that we have raised interest rates already by quite a bit and we’ve said we’ll raise them again. This does not have an immediate effect on inflation, but over the next one or two years those higher interest rates will dampen demand, reduce expenditure, and therefore reduce the ability of firms to charge high prices and in turn limit the scope of unsustainable wage increases. So a basic reason why inflation will be closer to our target is the actions of our monetary policy. We also do think that we will not experience the same energy inflation every year. But let me also say, we do think there will be a second round of inflation. As we have already discussed, many sectors need to raise their prices because their costs have gone up. Many workers also have so far suffered a big reduction in their living standards, but we expect them to receive bigger pay increases next year and also in 2024 and 2025. These bigger pay increases will support expenditure and will also raise prices. That is why it will take some time to return to our 2% target. So the second round effects will drive inflation next year and in 2024.  After the measures taken, and considering the lag in the effect of monetary policy on the economy, is a more cautious approach to the next rate hikes appropriate? And should the brighter inflation outlook take some pressure off the need for further aggressive policy tightening?  The interest rate decisions we’ve taken since July have been cautious moves. Having a rate of -0.5% was no longer appropriate when inflation risks had gone up. So normalising monetary policy has been the prudent approach, and we have said that we still have more to do. But it is also true that we need to recognise that the interest rate decisions we have already made will help to reduce the inflation rate next year and the year after that. We do expect that more rate increases will be necessary, but a lot has been done already, so we will have to ensure we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook, and the risk factors when setting the interest rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis.  A few days ago, you said you didn’t see many arguments in favour of a 75 basis point increase in rates. Has your view changed, or has it now become stronger after the latest economic data?  Let me disagree with this description. What I said last week, and I will also say to you now, is that when we had very low interest rates, a move of 75 basis points was reasonably straightforward. So that made sense in September and in October. We will see in December what the correct decision will be. But the starting point is different now. We’ve already hiked rates by 200 basis points. We will still be guided by the inflation outlook. But we cannot decide on the appropriate size of the increase in any one meeting without considering the starting point. And the starting point is now a lot higher than where we were in previous meetings.   Does this mean that you are now suggesting smaller rate increments?  The higher starting point is one dimension of the debate, but of course in terms of the wider debate we will have to look at the overall outlook. The point I am making is that when we take future interest rate decisions, including in December, we should take into account the scale of what we have already done. So the basis for the decision will be different.  A lot of firms and households see the increase in rates as another burden on top of recession and inflation. Why isn’t recession enough to lower price pressures? How will the ECB ensure that there won’t be an unnecessary tightening for firms and households?  Our current thinking is that if there is a recession it will be relatively mild and relatively short-lived. If it is a recession of maybe six months and a mild one, then the reduction in aggregate demand in that case would be smaller. Compared to a more severe recession, a milder and shorter recession is good news for Europe but it does mean that its anti-inflation impact will be relatively limited. I appreciate that the burden of the interest rate increases will not be uniform. For example, the households who have a variable rate mortgage will be more exposed than those who have a long-term fixed rate mortgage. And firms with a lot of debt will be more affected; and the implications are different for start-ups than they are for mature firms.  Which indicators will the ECB look at to determine the terminal rate?  We will always take a comprehensive approach. As I have said in my blog last week and other speeches, there are no shortcuts. There is no kind of special indicator that can uniquely tell us what the terminal rate will be.  But can you specify the main elements considered?  It boils down to all the factors that influence the inflation outlook. So, first and foremost, the inflation forecast. Second, the risks around that forecast. Third, there are the other indicators of the inflation dynamics. But, of course, we also take into account what is going on in the rest of the world.  In what way?  For example, if we think that the economy in the rest of the world is slowing down, or that global central banks will reduce demand through their own monetary policies, then the rate that we need to deliver will be affected. So our assessment takes into account the inflation outlook for the euro area, the global inflation outlook and the global central bank outlook as well. But in the end, we will look at a band of rates, not a single terminal rate. And to navigate that zone, the meeting-by-meeting approach will allow us to assess our immediate interest rate decision in the context of the zone of possible terminal rates.  Is this band of rates now higher than at the last Governing Council meeting?  I’m going to wait until all the data arrive, and the outlook is developed by the whole Eurosystem. We need to wait for the new Eurosystem staff projections. Once we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook, we will examine the implications for the terminal rate.  On the TLTROs, were you surprised by the low repayments by banks in November and do you expect more in December?  It’s important not to focus on the November number, but on how much banks may repay between November, December and January. Every bank is in a different situation and has different end-of-year considerations regarding the role of TLTRO financing in relation to overall funding. In general terms we think that there will be a significant reduction in the TLTRO liabilities in the coming windows, which is in line with the policy change we made.  On the quantitative tightening (QT) instead, how will the ECB ensure a process without market volatility? In December will only the principles be defined, or something more, too, like a timetable or an actual start of the operation?  It makes sense to have a two-step process. The first step is to define the principles. The second is to finalise a calendar. But I think that by now there is a universal consensus that is not specific to the ECB, that QT should essentially be a background programme. We would make sure that it makes its contribution to monetary policy normalisation in a way that reinforces the primary instrument, which is setting rates. Our main focus will be setting the policy rate, and QT will be operating in the background, in a predictable, measured way.  Do you envisage a passive QT with a percentage of maturing bonds in the asset purchase programme (APP) not reinvested?  The exact way we will decide to run down the APP will be decided at the upcoming meetings. But it is fair to expect that we will follow a steady approach. Every central bank is different in terms of the maturity structure of its portfolio, but the APP will allow a steady approach to be appropriate.  How will the ECB ensure that the anti-spread shield – the TPI – is effective? If we see greater fragmentation owing to monetary tightening, will the ECB be ready to activate that instrument?  We are super clear: we have a very good understanding of what’s involved. We know central banks can be extremely effective in any type of market stabilisation intervention. So the ECB will be very effective in its response to any kind of unwarranted fragmentation or disruption of the transmission mechanism.  So there should be no doubt that we can be very powerful and effective in using the TPI.  Could more expansionary fiscal policies by governments push the ECB to hike interest rates further?  The basic answer is yes. If the euro area runs up larger fiscal deficits, this will increase overall demand in the economy and that will, in turn, imply higher interest rates to make sure that inflation returns to 2%. That is why we have made it clear that in the immediate response to the energy crisis, governments do still need to do a lot to protect the most vulnerable and to offer support to firms that face particular challenges. But it helps if this is temporary and targeted rather than excessively boosting aggregate demand on a persistent basis.  What should governments do?  If the interventions are temporary, then there shouldn’t be a big impact on the deficits next year or the year after, which is what matters over the medium term. It is also important to be targeted: you can help the most vulnerable, but in a way that is less costly than programmes with a wider reach. So, it is possible to support households and firms needing support with temporary and targeted measures. But, if deficits were to remain too high indefinitely, this would add to demand pressures.   What are the main changes linked to the energy crisis and what are the lasting effects in the medium to long term for the European economy?  A number of points can be made, assuming that there is only a limited reduction in energy prices so that these do not go back to pre-pandemic levels. Number one is that Europe will be collectively poorer because we are a big energy importer. Lower incomes due to these extra energy payments will reduce demand in the economy. Number two is that some firms that use a lot of energy will lose competitiveness on a global scale. So you would expect to see some industries relocate to regions where energy is cheaper. But then, there is also the third and more optimistic point.  What is that?  The response to the energy crisis is accelerating and will stimulate the green transition and investment in renewable energy. This will take some time, but then the energy supply will be more secure, because we will no longer be reliant on imports of fossil fuels. And it will be cheaper because renewable energy will have lower marginal costs. So, I do think there’s a very difficult period to come, but also a faster transition to a more sustainable economy.  What is your view on the European Commission’s proposals for the new Stability and Growth Pact?  There will be a debate on this topic, and let’s see the details of the decisions. But let me be very clear about this point: what is most important is that Europe agrees a fiscal framework as early as possible in 2023, because we really need it to help European governments make decisions for 2024 and later years. We need a fiscal anchor to make sure that governments are able to reconcile their response to the energy crisis with the commitment to sustainable debt in the medium term.  But for monetary policy, which is the bigger risk? Doing too much or too little?  It is important to recognise that the worst-case scenario is one where inflation remains too high for too long. History teaches us that it is very costly to get rid of entrenched inflation. We need to avoid that by making sure that inflation goes back to 2% in a timely manner. But, subject to that imperative, we also want to make sure that we’re efficient and that it is done in a way that does not lead to overshooting and to an excessive reduction in economic activity. So I don’t think it is a good idea to make a binary decision between too much or too little. There is a hierarchy: we need to get inflation back under control and towards the target. But we also need to recognise that once we are closer to target, the risk of overshooting may emerge.  Can you specify what you mean when you say that you want to get inflation back to 2% “in a timely manner”? In what way does the meaning of this expression differ from “in the medium term”?  This is a very important point. The ECB has always said that we have a medium-term approach, but without providing a precise definition. The medium term can be longer if the deviation of inflation is not too great, but should be shorter if we have a big inflation gap to fix. This is the case at the moment. So, we use the expression “in a timely manner” not to tie us to any particular year or period of time, but to essentially signal that we want to get inflation back to 2% at an appropriate speed and not to take too long. So, it’s not satisfactory to say that inflation will be at 2% many years from now. We have to make sure that inflation is back to 2% within a reasonable time horizon, and the Governing Council will decide exactly what that will be.  Some have criticised the ECB’s approach of focusing solely on inflation, sometimes even in the short term, thereby ignoring the effects on the economy and on financial stability. The mandate is for inflation, but could defending your credibility on prices lead the ECB to make decisions without a more comprehensive assessment of the economy?  We always consider all dimensions of the impact of our policies. We always make sure that we’re proportionate in our decisions. The primary focus is on inflation. What matters is the inflation outlook in the medium term, which also depends on the economy and is not only linked to current inflation. You can be confident that we will make sure we meet our price stability target, but without causing excessive side effects for the economy and financial stability.   "
2022-11-21,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Market News ,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 16 November 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Market News    Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 16 November 2022 21 November 2022  What do you expect December’s Eurosystem growth and inflation projections to show?   The staff projections are going to cover 2023, 2024 and 2025. I think for 2023 the teams involved would have to take into account a number of factors. Number one, inflation is higher now than was expected in the last round. So the starting point for inflation is different compared to the last round. Over the course of the autumn it has become clear that next year energy prices are likely to remain higher than previously expected. Even though a lot of gas has been stored and we've had mild weather so far this winter, it's accepted that, based on the current outlook, the risks about gas supply are also going to be here next year. I think it's also clear that, at least in some countries, the pass-through of high energy wholesale prices to retail prices is not over. So we will see more of that. And in terms of fiscal policy, it looks like fiscal deficits are wider than foreseen in the September projection. So there is more fiscal support for the economy next year and that has inflation implications. For the medium term, looking into 2024, 2025, I think there are really two big issues. One is that it's clear that wages are set to increase more strongly than normal. We already saw in the September projection that there will be several years of nominal wages growing more quickly, because workers have experienced a significant loss in their real wages. We do expect this kind of catch-up process to drive nominal wages higher over several years. And, as we already had in September, there will have to be a kind of reassessment of the wage outlook in the context of the higher inflation rates, the status of the labour market and the fiscal support that is still there. The other factor that's going to be relevant for 2024-25 is the feedback loop. There's been a big jump in the yield curve and it's starting to pass through to bank lending conditions. Even if this does not have an immediate effect on the economy and on inflation, we would expect to see it kicking in more strongly in 2024 and 2025.  So for those years the forecast will have to balance the fact that inflation has a knock-on effect, for example, on the wage mechanism. But on the other hand, we do have the fact that the financial conditions are far different than what we had going into the September forecast.  A number of Governing Council members have recently expressed worries about second-round effects. How much of a concern, in terms of the inflation outlook, is pay growth?  This year we’ve had a very large increase in the price level, so there's been a very big drop in living standards. At the same time unemployment in historical terms is quite low. So even if the European economy experiences stagnation or a mild recession later this year and at the start of next year, it still has quite a lot of support for ongoing growth. Even if the energy shock levels out next year – so it's no longer a source of inflation, and even if globally bottlenecks are easing – so the pressure from global commodity prices and global goods prices also levels off: there's still going to be an inflation dynamic in 2024-25.  Labour costs are a big fraction of the domestic component of inflation. But then the question is: how long is that going to be for? And as I said earlier on: it's going to be stronger than the historical average, because workers will be trying to rebuild living standards. But how much and for how long labour costs will contribute to domestic inflation remains open and is a source of high uncertainty. There will be some calculation in the December projections, but month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter, over the next year, this is going to be one of the key issues we're going to watch. I don't think we're going to have a conclusive answer next year.  But there is a very important feedback loop here, which is also relevant for the decisions by firms. We've done a good amount of monetary policy normalisation, and we gave a clear signal that we will continue to raise rates until we have reached a level that will make sure inflation comes back to 2 per cent in a timely manner. Firms and workers should understand that price and wage-setting should take place in the context that the more expensive financial conditions will dampen demand next year and in the years after that. Firms should be careful about excessively raising mark-ups, and workers should be careful about what a sustainable wage increase is. There is an important interaction between what we do and how these price and wage decisions are set. Another way of saying this is that firms and workers should fully understand that inflation is going to come down over these years towards our 2 per cent target.  What would you need to see to recommend raising rates by 75 basis points in December? Conversely, what would justify a smaller rate hike?  We said in our recent meetings – and we did so again in October – that we expect to raise rates further. It's usually neither necessary nor wise to try and jump immediately to your target rate. In December we will make another hike and the scale of it should continue to make progress towards the levels needed. But it’s not necessary to conceive completing that transition in December. Each meeting is different. But one platform for considering a very large hike, such as 75 basis points, is no longer there. When we were at zero, that did not correspond to anyone's idea of the interest rate level necessary. Going to 1.5 per cent is still below where we need to go. But the more you've already done on a cumulative basis, that changes the pros and cons of any given increment. We will have to look at it in terms of the inflation outlook that we have in December and take into account that we are at a different point now, and also to recognise that there are lags in the transmission process.  Would increasing rates above 2 per cent in December offer greater scope to slow the pace of interest rate hikes in the first quarter of 2023?  I am not going to comment on the exact level at any one meeting. Clearly, there’s a connection: the higher the level of the interest rate, the smaller the remaining gap to the target rate. What matters is the level we're going to arrive at. The exact allocation across different meetings is a secondary issue. But the more we've already done, the less we need to do.  How likely is it that the ECB will stop – or pause – the hiking cycle either before or at the point when it begins quantitative tightening (QT)?  I don't think December is going to be the last rate hike. Trying to jump forward to February, to March, to May or June next year, I think it’s too early to have very strong views at this point. The logic of a pause for the ECB: we’re not at that point. The more relevant argument than whether to pause is to move at the appropriate time to smaller increments. And then, eventually, you get to a point, where, essentially you say: okay, we're at the level where it's probably going to be wise to hold at this level for a while but also signal that we will be open to do more if needed, because we are living under high uncertainty. Then let me come to the second part of your question, about QT. We shouldn't interconnect the issue so much. What is clear is that you want to make decent progress on raising the policy rate before you start mapping out QT. And by December, we will have made decent progress on that. We said that we will lay out a roadmap, general principles in December. The roadmap will subsequently convert into a more precise plan that will allow for the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio to decline at a certain pace in the coming months. But I don't think we're going to be on a meeting-by-meeting basis interconnecting the interest rate decision with the pace for the next month or two. It should be probably more mechanical than that. I think that's a pretty basic principle.  By how much would you expect QT to lower the terminal rate of interest?  I wouldn't approach the question like that, because there's no scenario in which we keep the APP at its current level. Of course, if you don’t scale down the APP portfolio, the policy rate would have to be higher – there is a substitution effect there. But the market does expect some degree of runoff of the APP, and that is already reflected in the yield curve. So the calibration of the APP schedule has to perform two objectives. One is to contribute to the overall stance by essentially reversing the kind of compression of term premia that quantitative easing (QE) did; and the other is to make sure that this is done in an orderly way, because we have to allow for the market to adjust.  The ECB has said that the expected shallow eurozone recession will not in itself be sufficient to bring inflation back to target. What is the sacrifice ratio that would?  We have to remember where we are. There's going to be a fairly large reduction in the inflation rates simply through base effects. But even if that reduces the inflation rate, it still leaves the cost of living permanently higher. So the price level is very important for wage dynamics. Going back to the monetary policy issue, we have to think about where inflation is headed in 2024-25 and what the distance is to our 2 per cent target. We also have to take into account what's already happened. The yield curve is higher, we see adjustments in bond markets and we see bank lending rates going up. More expensive financing conditions will mean a lower level of demand. That will mean a lower level of GDP and a lower level of employment. But the labour market has two margins at the moment: one is unemployment, the other is vacancies. You could have a slowdown in the economy, where one part of adjustment will be fewer vacancies. And with fewer vacancies, wage pressure will go down. And if you don't have the option to move to a new job, then wage bargaining changes. It could also be the case that firms opt to hold on to workers and there is a degree of labour hoarding. Under those circumstances unemployment may not rise as much as in previous cycles. I would say we would expect unemployment to go up as well, that is true, but in the context of levels that right now are historically quite low.  Your colleague Mr Panetta warned earlier this week that the ECB must be alive to the dangers of excessive tightening, which he said could result in a permanent loss of output in response to persistently lower demand. Do you agree?  We are absolutely clear and we have a primary mandate that we will get to our target in a timely manner. But it has always been the case and always will be the case that we want to do it in a way that minimises the side effects in terms of lower output and higher unemployment. The history of recessions does indicate that they tend to leave a long-term footprint. But what's also true is that there's an appreciation that the balancing act requires us to avoid under-tightening. Because if you under-tighten, inflation remains too high for too long, and then in turn you may end up having a bigger recession later on, with a bigger permanent drop in output. We currently do think that any recession will be mild and short-lived. But you can definitely construct scenarios where that recession gets bigger and longer. And if you have rising credit risk, then you will have financial tightening coming from the decline in the economy, and that will be important. Financial conditions in the euro area also interconnect with financial conditions globally. And with other central banks also tightening, you'd have to think about that spillover. If tightening in the rest of the world leads to lower global inflation pressures, lower commodity prices, lower pressure on tradeable goods prices, then the inflation forecast could improve for international reasons in addition to domestic reasons. This all goes back to why we are taking a meeting-by-meeting approach. We are giving a kind of directional orientation that we have more to do. But in terms of the exact scale of what we need to do, it would be a mistake to be overly fixated in either direction.  How happy are you currently with financial conditions across the eurozone?   What we see this year is a sharp change in the inflation outlook, which in turn led to a sizeable revision in monetary policies around the world. And, of course, the whole financial system is going to take time to absorb that. We would call on everyone to recognise that we're in a new environment and to manage those risks. I was involved myself in previous reports about what happens if you move away from the low-for-longer environment, so I think that the risk factors are clear. But in terms of where we actually are, I think the adjustment so far has been very much within the lines of reverting to normal rather than creating historically tight conditions.   Has the LDI fiasco in Britain affected your thinking in any way?  Maybe it sends out two signals: I think there’s a clear message for governments everywhere that it's very important to have fiscal strategies that are clearly anchored in debt sustainability and in making sure debt ratios are on a downward path. Second, we have to be vigilant for pockets of the markets that may have been taken by surprise. But let me again emphasise here that what we have is a kind of smooth adjustment so far to a very different environment.  The European Commission is currently in the process of renegotiating EU fiscal rules. What bearing, if any, does that have for the outlook for monetary policy?  Before the energy shock, this year the Commission would have forecast a pretty big drop in debt and deficit ratios in the coming years. There has been an improvement this year because a lot of the pandemic programmes have been stopped and we've seen the recovery in the economy, which has boosted tax revenues. This has allowed a lot of energy programmes to be launched, a lot of which are temporary in nature. One of the big issues, I think, for the coming year, is to make sure that these interventions are temporary and targeted, and are basically embedded in a larger strategy of making sure debt ratios, especially for the high-debt countries, are firmly on a downward path. I think everyone shares this analysis. But what is true is that having fiscal deficits that remain relatively high will support demand in the economy and add to medium-term inflation pressures. Everyone has to really look at this quite carefully, because a lot of the fiscal programmes right now are basically transfers to households or to firms. And the multiplier on transfers is lower than on government consumption or government investment. A lot of people who receive these transfers may just save them, so it’s not clear whether it will result in the same boost to aggregate demand.  Last week the ECB changed its collateral rules, which saw asset swap spreads tighten. How much does this solve the problem?   I think there are three factors here. One is the increase in our securities lending facility. The second is: the German debt management office has also announced measures. And the third is the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) decision we took in October, which will also release collateral back into the system. Of course, we'll always be attentive to market functioning and collateral scarcity issues. I would mention, also, that governments will still be issuing quite a lot of debt, and we're not going to be net purchasers, so the amount of collateral coming into the market from that source will also ease pressures.  So there shouldn't be any need, for example, to issue short-dated paper to relieve a year-end collateral squeeze?  We will always be vigilant, but I think the measures we've put in place will be sufficient.  Banks are pushing for the ECB to set up reverse repo operations, yet so far the bank has been hesitant to do so. Why? Is it under consideration?  First, the ECB always thinks about everything all the time, so there's no informational value in saying something is “under consideration”. The ECB always has a range of options for how it can manage its liquidity but I think the decisions we made last week will suffice. Also, we always have to think about the differences between the euro area, which remains very decentralised, and the American financial system. The Fed has a particular approach, but it’s not necessarily the best approach for us.  Does the lower-than-expected US October inflation print have any bearing on expectations for the eurozone HICP outlook?  One month of data does not constitute a trend, so let’s be cautious about this, we need a longer horizon. But if it turns out to be the case that there is a trend, there are basically two forces behind it. One is a decline in global inflation pressure, which will also benefit the euro area by lowering pressure on import prices. The other element could be a decline in domestic inflation. And we saw that, in fact, services inflation came down as well. That could suggest that the United States is now making progress in its adjustment, and of course that would be good news for the world economy and for us.  The German ZEW survey has just recorded a substantial rebound in expectations, although the outlook is still in negative territory, largely on the back of hopes that inflation will fall in the near future and monetary tightening will not be as severe as initially anticipated. Is this optimism justified?  A lot has been done to preserve energy supplies this winter, whether that's the filling up of gas storage or many firms – and indeed many households – reducing energy consumption. Clearly, compared to worst-case scenarios, this has led to a degree of confidence building for the near term. On our side, I do think that what we've done has helped – in the sense of ending the QE programmes and the by-now sizeable and repeated increases in policy rates – the actions we take demonstrate that there will be downward pressure on inflation. Then you come to the near term and that's where we should take into account that there is a lot of inflation pressure remaining in the pipeline, but this differs across countries. In some countries, Spain for example, energy inflation may have come down primarily because a lot of the adjustment happened a year ago. For other countries with longer-term contracts for energy, the pass-through to retail prices is ongoing. Sooner rather than later, the accumulated pass-through will convert into downward pressure on inflation, but let’s see whether the peak turns out to be this side of Christmas or the other.  So we might see, for want of a better word, some choppiness in near-term inflation expectations?  Around March, after the war started, there was a pick-up in consumer expectations. But they have been relatively stable in recent months. They haven't improved, but they haven't deteriorated either. I would say that these days my focus is on three levels. Historically, there would have been a kind of differentiation between short term and long term. But actually, I think the medium term is quite important. I do think, by and large, across all types of surveys and market indicators, people believe that over a longer horizon, inflation will get back to 2 per cent. People also understand that in the near term, over the next number of months, inflation is going to be elevated compared to our targets. But the important issue for us is the two-way feedback loop between medium-term expectations. Where do people think inflation will be in 2023, 2024, 2025? That will influence pricing decisions and wage decisions, while also recognising that these medium-term inflation expectations clearly will also be influenced by our decisions.  Across the euro area, corporate profits are soaring at the same time as an increasing number of households and businesses are struggling.   There isn't a universal message here. In some sectors, where demand was surprisingly strong this year, it is clear that one major source of inflation was not cost increases: it was firms responding to high demand compared to supply by raising mark-ups. A second category is clearly some types of energy firms which are generating windfall profits. There's a third category of firms which are suffering because they have very high energy bills, demand may not be particularly strong, and for those firms the profit margins are being squeezed. The message here is not so much for those firms but for the firms where mark-ups are currently high. These firms should be paying attention to the macroeconomic situation, to our policy, to the fact that demand conditions will be tighter next year. I am thinking about the tourism industry, for example, or the restaurant industry, all sorts of industries, which benefited from reopening this year. It will be very important to recognise demand conditions will be tighter and it would be a mistake to seek to preserve very high mark-ups in that scenario.   "
2022-11-08,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Politico,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck on 3 November 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Politico   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck on 3 November 2022 8 November 2022  Now that interest rates are approaching the neutral rate, can we expect smaller hikes going forward?   The neutral rate is a very interesting theoretical concept. But I don’t think it’s very helpful for policy prescription because it's unobservable and moves over time.  We will continue raising rates to a level that ensures inflation will come back into line with our definition of price stability. That level will depend on the data that we receive, the evolution of inflation, economic conditions, demand, and energy prices. Being data-dependent is the best approach in times of very high uncertainty such as we are living through now. At our next meeting, we will base our decision on the new projections that will be released in December and Eurostat’s flash inflation estimate for November, among other indicators.  Especially in light of this uncertainty would more incremental rate increases not be more prudent?   We are mainly guided by inflation and if you look at its evolution in October, you can see it is accelerating. Core inflation rose to 5%.  In December we will have new projections about the future evolution of inflation. I think we have been underestimating inflation for a long time, which is why it's important to have a much better understanding of inflation dynamics.  Do you expect to see a sizeable revision to the inflation outlook in December?  As I have said before, our projections will be published in December. My opinion is that inflation will hover around its present level of 10.7% over the next few months. It will start to decline in the first half of next year, but, on average, headline and core inflation will remain very high.   If you say very high, does that mean higher than the 5.5% the ECB currently projects for next year?   It is more about the trend, rather than a decimal point. I think the trend will be downwards in the first half of next year, even if still high on average.  We have all been underestimating inflation dynamics. Energy prices have had a lot to do with the evolution of inflation. By looking at the trajectory of energy prices, we can explain an important part of the evolution of headline inflation. But beyond that, energy also indirectly influences other items in the basket of goods and services, which are the main components of the current core inflation. We might have underestimated this as well, and we need to understand it better.   We understand that some of your colleagues think markets may have interpreted President Christine Lagarde’s press conference as more dovish than was intended. Do you share this assessment?   The President’s press conference reflected the discussions and the debate that we had in the Governing Council. I think our communication was clear. Afterwards, you have interpretations and market reactions and, in the short term, markets sometimes overreact. However, I think a sort of correction followed the initial immediate reaction.   Can you give me a sense of how deep a recession you expect to see next year in the eurozone?  In our September projections it was only the downside scenario which included a recession, not the baseline. Since then, the data that we have received have not been good in terms of growth.  In my view, there is a high probability that quarterly growth in the fourth quarter of this year will be negative. Negative quarter-on-quarter growth is likely to continue in the first quarter of 2023, which means we would face a technical recession. However, I don’t think it is going to be very profound.   So you would expect a technical recession and then a rebound, starting from the second quarter?  This is something we will have to continue analysing. Leading indicators such as PMIs are pointing to negative growth in the fourth quarter, and again in the first quarter. After that, we would expect a recovery but, given the high level of uncertainty, predicting beyond six months becomes extremely difficult.   Where do you expect growth impulses to come from other than an end to the war in Ukraine?  The war is an exogenous factor for us. I hope that this unjustified invasion ends as soon as possible because of the human cost. In my view, the factors that will drive the recession are the energy shock and the deterioration of the terms of trade due to rising energy and commodity prices. According to our calculations, this deterioration could represent close to 3% of euro area GDP, which implies an impoverishment for everybody. On top of this, current inflation is significantly reducing households’ real disposable income and negatively affecting capital expenditure. When you have inflation at the level that we have now, all the signals from the markets start to blur and capital allocation becomes much more difficult.  In this context, I think that the best contribution that a central bank can make towards restoring future growth is to reduce inflation.  Is the reason for a return to growth in the latter part of 2023 that there is lower inflation and so this uncertainty dissipates?  It’s not the only reason, but it is a very important one. The economic slowdown, including a possible technical recession, is driven by several factors: energy prices, uncertainty because of the war, and the dampening effect of inflation on investment and on household consumption through cuts in real disposable incomes. In conclusion, if we want to improve the growth outlook, it is very important to tackle inflation.   So, it's not a trade-off between growth and inflation?   No, this time it is not a trade-off. The factors behind high inflation are the same as those behind the slowing down of the economy. In my view, this is why errors have been made and many models have failed. Because they are unable to capture the nature of the shock that we are suffering now.  Do you have a message for national leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Georgia Meloni, who encouraged you to slow down tightening moves given the risks they pose to growth?   I respect the opinions of politicians and they are fully entitled to speak their minds. But our approach is quite clear: we have to abide by our mandate, which is price stability. We have to do our job and we have to explain what we are doing and why we need to tackle inflation, which is not an easy fight. For this, we are going to increase interest rates, which is going to have an impact on financing conditions. It will reduce aggregate demand, both consumption and investment, but it’s the only possible way forward that we have because doing nothing would be much worse.  The Finnish Prime Minister, Sanna Marin said in a tweet “there is something seriously wrong with the prevailing ideas of monetary policy when central banks protect their credibility by driving economies into recession.” Do you think that we need to have a debate about monetary policy ideas and if so, how can we do that without undermining your credibility in the process?  I will not enter into any political debate. One of the main reasons for the slowdown, including the technical recession we might face over the next quarters, is inflation. So reducing inflation is one of the main contributions that we can make in order to improve the growth outlook in the short to medium term. If we do not reduce inflation, the situation will be much worse. This is why the majority of central banks are raising rates. In the euro area, we are starting from a very accommodative monetary policy that we are now in the process of normalising in line with our mandate to keep prices stable.   You said you underestimated the impact that imported inflation had on other prices. What about wage developments and inflation expectations? What do you make of the latest wage rounds and do you have a message for unions across the region?   I will not try to convey a message to unions. In the current context of an energy shock and a deterioration of the terms of trade, we are suffering an impoverishment of our society. But it’s important that conflicting claims from workers and companies don’t lead to a sequencing of increases in wages and margins that are not compatible with this new situation. Otherwise this could give rise to a spiral of wages and prices, which would harden the monetary policy reaction, leading to a much worse situation than the one we have now. This is something we should avoid. In this context, fiscal policy can alleviate this impoverishment using very tailor-made policies for those parts of society that are much more vulnerable to the kind of shock that we are suffering.  Do you think that the current fiscal policies are targeted enough?  Last week we had the report of the European Fiscal Board, which states that most of the fiscal measures taken by governments are not targeted enough.   So you would like them to be more targeted than they currently are?  They have to be tailor-made to alleviate the hardships of the current shock. Fiscal policy has to react, supporting the incomes of the vulnerable groups of society. We should not fully eliminate the price signal, which could affect the compatibility between fiscal and monetary policy and delay the green transition. When we talk about targeted, selective measures, we are referring to support for the most vulnerable people.   How much of a problem is fiscal largess for the ECB right now?  I would wait for the European Commission to make an assessment on that. But my general recommendation is that fiscal policy cannot follow the stance that it did during the pandemic. This is because the nature of that shock was different. It required an extremely accommodative monetary policy that we are now normalising. Therefore, the general stance of fiscal policy has to be different too.   When do you think you will start quantitative tightening? Could it be quite soon?   We will start with it sooner or later, for sure in 2023. This process will have two positive effects: it will reduce excess liquidity and alleviate collateral scarcity. But quantitative tightening (QT) must be implemented with a lot of prudence. In my view, we should start with a passive QT by not fully reinvesting the maturing securities in our portfolio.  The characteristics and the timing of our QT, which may overlap or not with the process of normalising the interest rates, will be discussed in December. Personally, I don’t see any sort of sequencing here. The first instrument that we have used, because we believe it to be the most efficient one, is interest rates. QT is also part of the normalisation process of monetary policy and we will proceed with a lot of prudence and caution.   Still there are concerns that once you start reducing your balance sheet this could have a major impact on financial markets. And is the ECB currently facing a trade-off between price stability and financial stability?  Financial stability has deteriorated quite a lot over the last six months because of the economic outlook of lower growth and high inflation and the tightening of financial conditions.  However, the situation of the banks is much more positive now than it was ten years ago. They are more resilient today to that worsening of the outlook and the tightening of financial conditions. But we should pay special attention to non-bank financial institutions that are less strictly supervised and for which the macroprudential toolkit is more limited.  These institutions have taken a lot of risk in terms of leverage and illiquid assets in their portfolios. Although we don’t have any sort of supervisory power over them, we are very attentive to these institutions as they play a very important role in the financial landscape of the euro area and could potentially create a market accident. It would be very important to improve and enhance the macroprudential toolkit for non-banks to minimise potential risks.    "
2022-11-01,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Delfi,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Žanete Hāka","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Delfi   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Žanete Hāka 1 November 2022    How would you describe the situation of the euro area economy at the moment?    Inflation is still far too high in the euro area as a whole, and especially in Latvia. As you know, inflation in Latvia stood at 21.8% in October, which is well above the euro area average of 10.7%. Higher energy and food prices are still the main drivers of price increases. We are increasingly seeing that these higher energy costs are feeding through to more and more sectors in the economy. With this in mind, last week we decided to raise our interest rates for the third time in a row. And we expect to raise interest rates further to make sure that inflation returns to our medium-term target of 2% in a timely manner.   Currently, the dominant view is that inflation will return closer to the 2% target in 2024 (ECB's forecast of 2.3% in 2024). Is this outlook realistic, or could it take longer to tame high prices? Some economists say that the ECB has been sluggish in responding to inflation since it started its steady upward journey in the summer of 2021.   We started normalising our monetary policy almost a year ago, in December 2021, when we announced that we would phase out net bond-buying under our pandemic emergency purchase programme. We followed up by ending net buying under our asset purchase programme and ending our forward guidance on interest rates. Since July we have raised interest rates by 200 basis points – the fastest increase in the history of the euro. But we are not done yet. We will decide on future policy steps meeting by meeting, each time assessing how the outlook for the economy and inflation has evolved, also considering how the measures we have taken so far are working. The longer inflation stays at such high levels, the greater the risk that it spreads throughout the economy. Consumers and companies would then also start to expect higher inflation rates in future, and that is dangerous. That is something we must avoid.  And this is why we are determined to do what is necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target.   How would you respond to critics who say that the ECB might be too aggressive with its current rate increases? The ECB’s main goal is to steady inflation, but are you not afraid that raising interest rates too high, too quickly could really hurt businesses and halt future growth?    It is true that the likelihood of a recession has increased and uncertainty remains high. In these circumstances, we all have to do our job. A central bank has to focus on its mandate. Our mandate is price stability, and we have to deliver on that using all the tools we have available, choosing those that will be most appropriate and efficient. Ultimately, persistently high inflation rates are more damaging to society because they make everybody poorer. Stable prices provide the foundation for a well-functioning economy in which everybody benefits.   What can we expect in future – is there a specific interest rate level that you think you will need to achieve to control the situation in the euro area economy? Or are there levels that you will not try to reach? Or will it depend on the economic situation? Will you look only at inflation, or at other factors as well?  We are aiming for the interest rate that will deliver the 2% medium-term inflation target. The destination is clear, and we are not there yet. We will have further rate increases in the future. I’m not going to give you a number because we have turned our back on forward guidance in the current highly uncertain environment. We will decide on the future path and the pace of our rate increases on a meeting-by-meeting basis.   Do you think that risks to financial stability or the housing market are also increasing at the moment? What should be done to reduce them, and what actions is the ECB taking in this regard?    The high rates of inflation that we are currently seeing are weighing on households’ disposable income, especially for those households whose income was low in the first place. At the same time, we see that the labour market is remarkably robust. This has helped to shore up household finances so far, together with savings built up during the pandemic, government support and loan repayment holidays. However, households might be vulnerable to increasing debt servicing costs, especially in countries where residential properties are overvalued, debt levels are elevated, and a larger share of household debt is subject to variable interest rates. These risks are best addressed by country-specific policies. We will provide a more detailed picture later this month when we publish our biannual Financial Stability Review.  Do you have any guidelines for banks in the event that the number of overdue loans increases rapidly to ensure financial stability?    Higher interest rates and the normalisation of monetary policy in general will affect banks differently depending on their business model. Our banking supervisors will make sure that banks are prepared to withstand potential adverse effects. But we all need to pay close attention to newly emerging risks, including those resulting from Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. The direct impact of the war on euro area banks has been limited so far, but the environment for businesses and the economy as a whole has changed. ECB banking supervisors have launched a review of the provisioning practices of the euro area’s most significant banks to ensure that they are prepared. We all need to be extremely vigilant right now.   Some people compare this crisis with the 2008 crisis; some say that they have nothing in common, but others find similarities. Do you think that the situation could become as bad as in 2008-09 or are central banks, countries and other institutions better prepared now?  We learned a great deal from the global financial crisis and banks are in a better position now than they were before that crisis. This is also because we now have joint banking supervision across the euro area. But there is no room for complacency. We all need to be vigilant and ready to respond to whatever may happen.   How do you evaluate the euro area countries’ financial discipline? In the pandemic, there was a need to increase countries’ debts and to support companies and households, but we are now facing an energy crisis and countries can’t reduce their debts, and payments for debts are increasing – is there a risk that countries could face a more severe crisis as a result?  Since Russia’s unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine, governments have acted quickly to help those most exposed to rising prices in the unfolding energy crisis. This is very encouraging as it strengthens our societies. But it is important that these measures are temporary, targeted and tailored, and they must also incentivise energy saving. Because only then will they help prevent the effects of high inflation from spreading throughout the economy and limit the impact on public finances. And beyond these emergency measures, it is essential that we accelerate the transition to clean energy. The EU can play a strong role here through public investments. This will then also lower inflationary pressures.     How do you evaluate Latvia’s financial discipline and financial sector? Do you see some risks for our country’s economy?  Latvia’s government debt stood at 41.6% of its overall economic output, or gross domestic product, at the end of the second quarter of this year. This is far below the euro area average of 94.2%. One of the biggest risks I see, not only for Latvia but for the entire euro area, is the high level of uncertainty that we are facing as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Large parts of inflation are being driven by higher energy costs. The limited visibility on how these will develop makes it hard for households and companies to plan ahead. A coordinated EU response to provide energy supply security could change this, for example though common EU purchases. It would avoid EU countries outbidding each other on the international energy market.     Can you give some forecasts for the euro area for next year? What will the economic situation in the region be like?  We published our latest round of projections in September. The baseline projections showed inflation at 8.1% this year, 5.5% next year and 2.3% in 2024. Growth is expected to slow to 0.9% next year and to reach 1.9% in 2024. Given the high level of uncertainty about the economic outlook for the euro area owing to Russia’s war in Ukraine, we also published a downside scenario that assumes that the war is very protracted, implying persistent geopolitical tensions. The downside scenario foresees slightly higher inflation rates for this year and next, reaching 2.7% in 2024. While this scenario still expects the euro area economy to grow this year, it foresees a contraction next year, and a return to growth in 2024. Since September, the growth outlook compared with the baseline has weakened. We will have a more complete picture in December when we have our next round of projections.          "
2022-10-14,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Verslo žinios,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Dalius Simenas on 10 October 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Verslo žinios   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Dalius Simenas on 10 October 2022 14 October 2022  Some experts are sceptical whether monetary tightening and rapid raising of interest rates are an effective tool to tame inflation, which in the euro area is driven mainly by extremely high energy prices, by Russia's energy blackmail towards those European countries supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression. Are you confident that the European Central Bank (ECB) will manage to curb the record high inflation that reached 10% in September and to get it back to the ECB’s target of 2% over the medium term?   An important part of the inflationary process that we are now facing has been driven by external factors, such as increased energy prices, more expensive raw materials, food, etc. According to our calculations, energy and food prices currently account for two-thirds of inflation in the euro area. However, inflation is also being pushed up by demand for goods and services, as is particularly the case in the Baltic countries. Increased demand can be contained through decisions to normalise monetary policy, while I agree that monetary policy has no influence on energy prices. Nevertheless, it is very important to avoid second-round effects and prevent inflation being passed on to wages, which would push inflation higher. In order to avoid this, inflation expectations need to remain anchored. Market participants must have confidence in the credibility of the central bank. We will do whatever is necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target over the medium term.  The OPEC+ alliance, which also includes Russia, recently decided to substantially cut oil production as of November. This has already driven oil prices higher. It is likely that this decision has not made it any easier for the ECB to achieve its goal of bringing inflation down to the target level.  Oil prices are global prices as they depend on producers and the world economic outlook. From an economic perspective, lower oil prices could help reduce inflation and, at the same time, support the economic recovery, thereby facilitating the decisions of policymakers.  What is the state of the euro area economy at the moment?  I think we are going to face a very difficult combination of low economic growth, including the possibility of a technical recession, and high inflation. According to our September projections, inflation will be hovering around 10% until the end of this year and will start to gradually decline in 2023. In this context, monetary policy has to focus on the evolution of inflation, which is what the Governing Council will be looking at when taking decisions. However, the environment will be very challenging and uncertain.  What is your forecast for the euro area’s economic development?  What we considered as our downside scenario in September, is coming closer to the baseline scenario. The current global context, including the monetary policy action, the energy shock and deterioration of the terms of trade, among others, point towards a slowdown of the global economy and, eventually, of the inflation rate as well.  Under the downside scenario from our September projections, the euro area economy would shrink by almost 1% in 2023, while the baseline scenario envisages GDP growth of 0.9%. The difference between the baseline and downside scenarios lies in the evolution of energy supplies from Russia. The assumption under the baseline scenario is that 20% of energy deliveries would continue to be supplied, whereas the downside scenario assumes a total cut-off. Currently, as I have said before, we are getting closer to the downside.  Is it correct that forecast inflation is also higher under the downside scenario?  That’s right. Under the downside scenario, annual inflation is expected to decline from an average rate of 8.4% this year to 6.9% in 2023. Under the baseline scenario, inflation is expected to go down from an average of 8.1% this year to 5.5% in 2023.  Currently the interest rate on the ECB deposit facility is 0.75% in the euro area. What should be the terminal rate to anchor inflation expectations?  That is very difficult to say. We are dependent on the data we receive. There is a very high level of uncertainty. We do not know how the war will develop and what impact it will have on energy prices. All these factors make it very difficult to determine the level of the terminal rate.  We have adopted a prudent stance: our response will depend on how the data evolves in the coming months. In December we will have new projections for inflation and GDP growth that will guide our decisions, despite the high uncertainty.  Historically, average interest rates in advanced economies hovered around 4%. Is this a reality that euro area businesses and mortgage borrowers will face again?  This will depend on various circumstances. Over the last 15 years interest rates have been much lower than that figure and we have had negative interest rates for a long period of time. In my view, structural factors that pushed inflation down in recent times have started to shift. Globalisation is not going to be as intense as it was, and the energy shock can drive inflation higher. So, I think that monetary policy has to adjust to these new structural features that may push inflation upwards when compared to the past decade.   The cost of borrowing for governments has risen dramatically in recent weeks and months. For instance, the Estonian government recently issued ten-year bonds at 4%, despite having among the lowest levels of debt in the euro area. Yields of ten-year government bonds of southern euro area countries fluctuated on average around 3-5%. What is your advice to governments – how should they keep the rising borrowing costs under control?  Fiscal policy has to be supportive of the process of monetary policy normalisation conducted by the ECB. We cannot ignore the fact that inflation is the main problem in the euro area, which is quite obvious in the Baltic countries. Inflation is reducing the purchasing power of households, especially of those that are more vulnerable, and is dampening investment. Thus, we have to pursue a normalisation of monetary policy. Higher interest rates are needed to try to subdue the rising level of inflation that is clearly above our 2% target over the medium term.  Could you please specify what kind of fiscal policy would be compatible with the anchoring of inflation expectations?  As we are in the process of normalisation of our monetary policy, fiscal policy needs to play a different role than the one played during the pandemic. In the current context, fiscal policy has to be more selective and targeted to support the most vulnerable groups of society. If countries start putting in place indiscriminate measures across the board, the mission of monetary policy will become more challenging and we may be unable to achieve the ultimate goals of reducing dependence on Russian energy and supporting the green transition.  Fiscal policy and monetary policy do not seem to be going hand in hand. The governments of Germany, Lithuania and other euro area countries have chosen the path of subsidising energy prices, which increases their borrowing and budget deficits.  I don’t comment on the policy decisions of any government. But, as a general recommendation, fiscal policy has to be compatible with the process of normalisation of our monetary policy stance. State support has to be temporary and targeted to the most vulnerable groups while facilitating the green transition.   What is your assessment of the policy implemented by the Lithuanian government?  I think that Lithuania is implementing a very prudent fiscal policy. With a public debt ratio of 40% of GDP, Lithuania’s public debt and budget deficit are clearly below the euro area average. The main problem is inflation, which currently is above 20% – at levels also observed in the other Baltic countries. Disparities in inflation rates among euro area countries will have to be monitored and analysed in detail.      "
2022-09-27,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Der Standard,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by András Szigetvari on 20 September 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Der Standard   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by András Szigetvari on 20 September 2022 27 September 2022  In Austria the autumn round of wage negotiations has just started, with the metalworkers’ union demanding a pay rise of 10.6 per cent. Are you worried about this sort of figure?  Unions and employers should not ignore what has happened. High inflation will have to be reflected in higher wages. But this needs to be balanced. Wages will grow more than they have in recent years. But trying to fully shield workers from inflation through higher pay would lead to a big increase in costs for firms and second-round effects.  Such as?  Firms would have to pass pay rises on to consumers through higher prices. Then, next year trade unions would again have to say: inflation is still high, we need another large pay increase. Many of the wage rises we are currently seeing in the euro area are balanced and in the middle ground, where there is some attempt to make sure that the living standards of workers do not suffer too much but also a recognition that fully protecting workers by matching inflation one for one in wage agreements would be self-defeating. This would just prolong very high inflation rates, which would require a much bigger and tougher monetary policy response.  This would be a wage-price spiral. But trade unions are saying that businesses are also hiking their prices because in an environment of high inflation, they can. Firms are making additional profits, which for the unions is problematic.  Let me fully agree with this criticism. I would strongly warn firms not to expect the same level of profitability in times of high inflation. To me, the collective message of balance is important. In order to get back to lower inflation, we need to realise that corporate profitability will decrease for a while and that wages will not fully keep up with inflation for a while either.   Are there signs that this realisation is taking hold? This may well be your hope, but what can the ECB do?  There are two specific factors here. First, because of the war and the high energy prices, there are many indicators that the economy is going to slow down. Many people are talking about recession. Firms know that in a difficult environment they may lose their market share if they hike their prices too much. On the other hand, if pay settlements are too high, the likelihood of layoffs in the event of an economic downturn increases. Second – and this brings us back to the job of the ECB – is that we are now making sizeable interest rates increases. This should make it clear to businesses and workers that demand conditions will become less favourable. So if you keep raising your prices, you risk losing demand and revenues.  So this means that employees have to accept a loss in their real income. We’re becoming poorer.  This year we will spend around five per cent of euro area income on net energy imports. Previously, this figure was around one per cent. We will need to bear that burden collectively. Living standards will fall as a result of energy bills. This does make people poorer and will feel like a recession to many. The reason is that in Europe we import so much of our energy. It’s different in the United States, which produces a lot of energy, so there are winners and losers from high energy prices. But we expect inflation to decrease significantly in 2023, with further decreases in 2024. And there will be some wage catch up over time, so that living standards start to improve again.  What makes you think that inflation will fall? That’s a bold prediction.   First of all, we think that, by the middle of next year, energy prices will have largely stabilised, even if we do not necessarily expect to see a larger decline. Second, these developments were caused in part by pandemic-induced bottlenecks, which led to production delays and delivery problems. We saw this in the automotive industry, for instance. This situation there has now eased somewhat. Similarly, fast-rising transport costs in shipping are now also falling. A third factor is that energy accounts for a large share of the production costs for food. This explains why food has become so much more expensive as energy prices have risen. If energy prices now stabilise, this will also dampen price increases for food. On top of this, our interest rate hikes will slow demand in the economy.   For 30 years now, prices have only risen very slowly. Now there are a number of economists who believe that the period of low inflation is past. Energy is becoming more expensive. The fight against the climate crisis is pushing up transport costs. On top of this, the impact of globalisation is waning. Pay pressure is rising in China as well, and the country now wants to be far more than just the “world’s factory”.    What we’ve seen over the last year is largely an energy shock, leading to the sudden rise in electricity and gas prices. This is a near-term issue to which we have to respond. At the same time, in the background we are seeing a change in the dynamics of some forces that operate, as you say, over a much longer period. Prior to the pandemic, the low price of oil and the contribution of supply from China and other emerging market economies to reducing prices, especially of manufactured goods, ensured that inflation remained low. These forces are unlikely to return, which will probably raise inflationary pressure compared to the pre-pandemic period of extremely low inflation. We can, however, respond to this environment by adjusting our monetary policy. Greater inflationary pressure does not necessarily mean that we will experience high inflation, because we can take action against that.   And yet there are many critics who accuse the ECB of reacting too late.  If someone says the ECB has been passive or inactive, I don’t agree with that. Since last December we have moved monetary policy quite a bit. Maybe one of the big messages here is, since 2015 monetary policy has essentially had two components. One is the size of the ECB balance sheet. We have bought a lot of government bonds. We have supported the banks through our programme of targeted long-term loans to encourage lending. The first job this year has been to take steps to move away from an expanding balance sheet. We had a sequence where until June, that was the first job. The second job is now raising interest rates.   The economist Maurice Obstfeld warns that central banks could do too much with their interest rate hikes. His argument runs like this: we’re no longer living in the 1970s, the major economies import more goods and services than before. This means that what the central banks in the United States, Britain and other countries do is also relevant for us. If pretty much every central bank raises interest rates, the impact will be too strong, choking off the global economy.   This is an important point. The reality is that inflation has both a global and a domestic component, but the domestic component is pretty large. But this is not an either/or situation. Absolutely, we do have to take into account the fact that central banks around the world are now tightening policy, which will lower global inflation. So when we say inflation will come down in Europe, it's partly because global inflation will come down. But we also need to do our part of the job and make sure that the domestic component of inflation, which is responsive to our monetary policy, comes down. If inflation is running at nine per cent, as it is right now, this is a major challenge for everyone.  How are governments’ spending policies impacting the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy? Many euro area countries are spending a tremendous amount of money as a response to the inflation crisis.  The energy shock we are experiencing is huge. It is the poorest people in our society that are most affected. From the point of view of fairness, but also from a macroeconomic perspective, governments should support the income and consumption of those households and firms that are suffering the most. The big question is whether part of this support ought to be financed by tax increases for those that are better off. This could take the form of higher taxes on higher earners or on industries and firms that are highly profitable in spite of the energy shock. If you support those in need through higher taxes, it has less of an effect on inflation than if you increase deficits.   Does that mean that higher deficits present a risk? The original strict rules for government budgets have been suspended in the EU until the end of 2023.   In the short run, it won’t be possible to avoid somewhat higher deficits, but there has to be a clear time limit. This is important for monetary policy. This year is a special case because pandemic spending is normalising. The economy has reopened and many pandemic-related subsidies have expired. We are therefore not seeing major new deficits this year. It’s more an issue for next year, to make sure that the deficit continues to improve rather than getting stuck at the current level. This does not mean moving towards austerity, just moving away from expansionary policy.  You are predicting a decline in inflation and signalling further rate hikes. Yet, the ECB forecasts only a slight increase in unemployment. Is Europe to expect developments like those in the United States? The United States is in recession, but the labour market is thriving.   Most of the improvement in inflation will come from energy prices stabilising and bottlenecks easing, because that is basically an improvement on the supply side of the economy. That can happen without an increase in unemployment. Demand will also moderate, including because of our monetary policy, and this will weaken the labour market. At the same time, it is probably not only the unemployment rate that we should be looking at. In Europe, and even more so in the United States, the number of vacancies is very high, many firms are looking for workers. One way for the labour market to be able to cool off is not to have more unemployed, but instead to have fewer vacancies.   Is there still this correlation between higher interest rates and weaknesses in the labour market?    That relation is still there. And we do expect unemployment to go up. But the dominant issue for now is the supply dimension, not the demand dimension, which is where this relation would matter more.    "
2022-09-22,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with t-online,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Florian Schmidt on 15 September 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with t-online   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Florian Schmidt on 15 September 2022 22 September 2022  Ms Schnabel, you come from Dortmund, a city of hard workers, or “Malocher” as they are referred to locally. How often do you think about these people in the context of high inflation?  Many people are worried that they won’t be able to pay their energy bills. Some even struggle to pay for food at the end of the month because prices are rising so much. This is of great concern to me because we at the ECB are responsible for price stability in the euro area. It is our task to ensure that annual inflation is at 2% over the medium term. Right now we are far away from our target – inflation is much too high.  Inflation in Germany was 7.9% in August. Are we ever going to see it go down?  Yes, but not immediately, unfortunately. Current inflation is mostly driven by a strong increase in energy prices. Another factor is the pandemic-related disruption to supply chains, which is making many products more expensive. We are also seeing food prices growing significantly around the world. Our monetary policy has little impact on what is happening on global commodity markets.  Why?  The ECB’s monetary policy affects inflation mainly through demand. When interest rates increase, loans become more expensive and saving becomes more attractive. This lowers the demand for products – both from consumers, who spend less, and firms, which invest less. Companies can then no longer hike their prices so quickly because there are fewer people who want their products. As a result, inflation falls. But this takes time.  How much time?  Probably a while still. Inflation may continue growing in the short term, despite the recent interest rate hikes.  So when is it going to fall again?  According to our projections, it will take until 2024 for inflation to stabilise around our 2% target.  In other words, you will continue to miss your inflation target for more than a year still. Have you failed?  As I said, current inflation is in large part due to factors we cannot influence directly. The war in Ukraine exacerbates the situation. It weighs on economic growth and drives inflation further up. But we have normalised our monetary policy step-by-step already since December of last year. First, we stopped additional purchases of government bonds. Then, since July, we have increased the policy rates twice significantly, leaving negative and zero interest rates behind. In early September we even hiked rates by 0.75 percentage points. This sent out an important signal: We are doing whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our 2% target.  Much too late, according to critics.  In anticipation of our measures, the interest rates in financial markets have started to rise much earlier, and they rose very fast. It is also worth remembering that ever since the pandemic started, we have been facing enormous uncertainty. When the Omicron wave hit last winter, we didn’t know whether we could be looking at widespread lockdowns once again. In the spring, it was impossible to say what impact the war would have on economic developments and inflation. In the view of the ECB’s Governing Council, the steps taken to reach our medium-term inflation target were appropriate at the time.   Some economists warned about higher inflation as early as spring. Why were ECB experts so wrong?  With the benefit of hindsight we can have a discussion about whether we should have acted a little sooner. But now the interest rate turnaround has started. We are on the right track.  The most recent interest rate hike was the largest in the ECB’s history. Some people are now worried this could choke off the economy. Which is worse: inflation or recession?  The ECB has a clear mandate – price stability. The signal we sent with our latest interest rate hike is clear: we are taking decisive steps to curb inflation and are making sure that it stabilises again at 2% in the medium term.  So economic development doesn’t matter for you?  A looming downturn would have a dampening effect on inflation. Of course, we take this into account when calibrating our monetary policy. However, the starting point of interest rates is very low, so it is clear that we need to continue raising rates.   Will that happen at the next meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council at the end of October already?  I’m expecting that the ECB’s Governing Council will continue to increase interest rates at its next meeting. What I cannot say is how big this hike will be or at what level we will stop increasing rates. We are deciding meeting by meeting, based on an assessment of all the economic and inflation data.  The ifo Institute expects Germany to face a “winter recession”? Do you expect that too?   For the euro area as a whole we are currently expecting an economic stagnation rather than a recession. Unfortunately, the situation in Germany is worse. Owing to its strong dependency on Russian gas, Germany has been especially hard hit. A recession may potentially be unavoidable here.   Will that also cause mass layoffs?   The labour market has proven to be very robust so far. The unemployment rate in the euro area is at a historical low; many countries, Germany included, are even experiencing a shortage of labour. Many firms may deem it in their interest to retain their staff despite challenging business conditions.   Does that mean things might not be so bad after all?   Hopefully, most workers will keep their jobs. But people will nonetheless feel the effects of the high prices, especially those on low incomes, because wages are not keeping pace with the rise in prices.   That may in turn result in high inflation becoming ingrained in the minds of many people. How much does that concern you?  Inflation expectations play a crucial role in our decisions. We see with some concern that more people expect inflation to exceed our 2% target also in the medium term. This makes it all the more important to send clear signals that people can rely on the ECB and that inflation will go down again.   And why should people believe you, now of all times?   Because the ECB has shown repeatedly in the past that it responds appropriately to economic developments. We acted decisively at times when inflation was too low, and during the coronavirus pandemic we contributed significantly to Europe emerging from this severe crisis in good shape economically. In this way we showed that citizens can rely on the central bank. People can trust us; we will fulfil our mandate and ensure price stability.   But what happens if that doesn’t work – and if people nonetheless expect persistently high rates of inflation?   One danger is the emergence of a wage-price spiral. If employees, against the backdrop of rising inflation expectations, demand very high wage increases and businesses then pass these on through even higher prices, wages and prices can drive each other up. But we see no signs of that happening at present. Wage growth has increased, but it is still moderate.   Really? In the current round of wage negotiations, the German metalworkers’ trade union IG Metall alone is demanding a huge wage hike of 8.2%.   So far, wage agreements are nowhere near keeping pace with inflation. Price-adjusted wages are falling, meaning that purchasing power is declining.   So a one-off agreement between employers and employees on a substantial increase would not automatically push up inflation?   We need to avoid that people expect permanently high inflation. That is why we are closely monitoring wage growth dynamics.   The governments of Europe are now deploying an array of instruments in an attempt to relieve the pressure on their citizens. Can the use of such instruments make up for the loss of wealth?   Higher energy prices are making Europe poorer. We have to transfer a larger share of our income abroad to pay for energy imports. Governments can’t do anything to change that in the short term. However, they can take targeted measures to ease particular hardships and prepare for the future. To this end, politicians should not disregard the effects of prices on behaviour. At the end of the day, higher energy prices will help us become less dependent on fossil fuels and thus achieve our climate targets. Moreover, investments are required in order to speed up the transition to renewable energies. When designing fiscal support programmes, care should be taken that they do not further fuel inflation.   How so?  Government relief measures for the broad mass of the population could stimulate demand and push up inflation. We might then have to raise interest rates even more. From a political perspective it may be favourable to appeal to a large share of the electorate with a package of relief measures. But it should always be at the back of our minds that, in the long term, we will have to collectively bear these costs.   Where do you yourself notice this at the moment?  I am able to cope with the current situation. People with higher incomes and wealth will of course be less well off too, but they can more easily draw on their savings to cushion the effects.   And what do you cut back on in your daily life?   First and foremost I try to lower my energy consumption. Not only to save money, but also for environmental reasons.   In conclusion let’s turn to Italy, where the anti-EU candidate Giorgia Meloni of the far-right party Fratelli d’Italia (Brothers of Italy) could become prime minister next Sunday. How concerned are you about that?   We never comment on political developments in individual countries. The ECB is independent and conducts monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. That is why we are guided by inflation in the euro area, even if the situation naturally differs from one country to another.   The level of government debt also differs. Italy has a very high level and will suffer correspondingly in the future from a rise in interest rates.   A country’s ability to service its debt hinges fundamentally on its economic growth. That means that countries must get on a sustainable growth path. The European support package Next Generation EU, which was introduced during the pandemic, plays a significant role in this respect. It’s very important that the growth projects, which are financed through this programme, are pursued consistently and fully implemented. That is a task for national governments. But we are all in the same boat. That’s why it’s important to also develop common solutions at European level in order to overcome the current crisis.   Ms Schnabel, many thanks for this interview.     "
2022-09-16,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Expresso,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 9 September","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Expresso   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 9 September 16 September 2022  After the policy rate was increased by 0.75 percentage points last week, Christine Lagarde said that “we are so far away from the rate that will help us return inflation to 2%”. Does that mean that we could have another 75 basis point rise at the meeting in October, as markets already seem to anticipate?  It is very hard to understand our decisions without looking at the projections, which have just been updated and contain different scenarios – the baseline and the downside scenarios. Inflation is very high – the latest figure is 9.1% for the euro area – and our projections indicate that it will continue to be high for the rest of the year. It is going to decline eventually but still remain above our 2% target over the medium term. In 2024, inflation is projected to be 2.3% on average in the euro area.  Inflation is the main factor that we have to focus on, as we did when we decided to increase rates by 75 basis points. Uncertainty is very high. We will be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach to set interest rates. We will not make any precommitments. We want to be flexible and have leeway in our decision-making.  When Christine Lagarde said that we are still so far away from the interest rate level that is necessary to bring inflation down, does that mean that we should reach that rate faster, or that the interest rate level should be higher?  The reality is that inflation is currently 9.1% and our target is 2% over the medium term. There is a big difference. That is why we started normalising our monetary policy. Within the Governing Council we do not have any estimates of the terminal rate – the maximum level to which rates could rise – or the neutral rate – the rate that balances the economy at full employment with stable inflation. We have not decided anything. But, as the President indicated, more hikes might come in the next few months – how many times and by how much will depend fundamentally on the data – and we underscore our full determination to make inflation converge towards our definition of price stability.  When do you think we could have inflation back at 2% again?  According to our projections, in 2024 we will be a little above our target with average inflation of 2.3% in the euro area. In the downside scenario, which incorporates a total cut-off of gas deliveries by Russia, the rate would be 2.7%. That is rather high. We expect that inflation will start to decline to an average of 5.5% in 2023, which is still a lot. There is a high level of uncertainty and how the Russian invasion of Ukraine evolves will also play a key role. This is why we want to keep flexibility as ample as possible in order to be able to react to this kind of situation.  Some critics say the ECB was slow to react to rising inflation. What is your answer to those critics, given that, as you said, inflation is well above the target of 2%?  We started the process of monetary policy normalisation in December when we decided to set an end date for our asset purchase programmes: the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the asset purchase programme (APP). The projections over the last 12 months have underestimated the evolution of inflation. This happened not only at the ECB, but also in other international institutions. The pandemic was a big disruption to the normal functioning of the economy, as were other events that were difficult to anticipate, like the war in Ukraine. Once we corrected the gap between forecasts and reality, we reacted. Now it is important to look forward. We have a much better understanding of the drivers of inflation, the interplay between supply and demand factors, and the need to avoid second-round effects. It is key for us to keep inflation expectations anchored and under control.  Is the ECB now on the correct path to control inflation?  Monetary policy is an instrument that produces its effects with a certain lag. Depending on the country and the monetary policy transmission mechanism, it could take between 12 and 24 months. But inflation expectations are something that we can influence very rapidly. Therefore, what is important is the signals that we are sending. First, that the ECB is fully committed to reducing inflation in line with our 2% target over the medium term and, second, that we should avoid second-round effects on inflation.  Is the unanimity in the decision last week a signal that at the ECB you are now all pulling in the same direction and share the concern about the current level of inflation?  There are 25 of us in the Governing Council of the ECB. There are always differing views. But at the end of the day, we all approved the 75 basis point increase. There is a unanimous position with respect to the need to maintain our credibility and commitment to reduce inflation in line with our target.  The downside scenario of the ECB’s projections points to a recession in the euro area in 2023. How likely is this scenario?  The downside scenario assumes a total cut-off of the supply of oil and gas to the euro area, a protracted war in Ukraine and additional uncertainty. This is the main difference compared with the baseline scenario, which signals the currently high level of uncertainty. The downside scenario results in a recession of -0.9% with inflation close to 7% in 2023. It is a very tough scenario for the euro area. While the situation we have now is difficult, should the downside scenario materialise, it would be considerably worse for families and firms.   Does the possibility of a recession constrain monetary policy or, given the current high level of inflation, does the ECB have no other option but to raise interest rates quickly?   The slowdown of the economy is not going to “take care” of inflation on its own. We need to continue the normalisation of monetary policy. This is something everyone has to understand. The forces that are behind the economic slowdown are very similar to those pushing inflation higher. We have a supply shock that is lowering growth and simultaneously raising inflation. What we want to avoid is the sort of situation that we had in the 1970s, which also started with an energy shock followed by second-round effects that made things much worse. The world economy is in a different situation now, but this is something we have to take into consideration. Let me be very clear: the slowdown of the economy will reduce demand pressures, which will lower inflation. But, simultaneously, we have to act from the monetary policy standpoint to keep inflation expectations anchored and avoid second-round effects.   The Chair of the Federal Reserve System of the United States, Jerome Powell, recently said that monetary tightening may bring some pain to households and businesses. Is this also inevitable in the euro area? Is it the price we must pay to tackle inflation?   The level of inflation that we have now in Europe is undeniably already causing pain. In my view, Jerome Powell’s message is that we will have to take decisions to reduce inflation that might be painful in the short and medium term, but that will be positive for our citizens in the long run.   President Lagarde has called on governments not to adopt measures that will fuel inflation. But many countries are taking measures to help households and businesses deal with energy prices and inflation. Is there a risk that fiscal policy may end up having the opposite effect to the intended monetary policy effect?   Fiscal policy is in the hands of governments and the European Commission, not of the ECB. Our assessment of fiscal policy is quite clear: it should be selective, targeted and temporary. We know that inflation is causing a lot of pain, particularly for low-income households. This is why it is really important that fiscal policy plays a role in alleviating the pain inflicted by inflation on these vulnerable groups. The ECB welcomes such measures. But expansionary fiscal policy should not happen.  There is another issue that has to do with the energy shock, which has generated some debate among economists. That is whether or not these measures to reduce energy prices actually end up increasing demand, which is the opposite of what they are trying to achieve. I think that reducing demand for energy in Europe is the best tool to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russia.   Is fragmentation still a risk or is it no longer a problem following the announcement of the transmission protection instrument and the reinvestment of redemptions from maturing securities?  So far, we have not seen major signs of fragmentation in Europe. Spreads are under control as we go through the process of monetary policy normalisation and yield curves are moving upwards. Fragmentation is something that we are going to fight because it impairs the transmission of our monetary policy decisions. This is a unanimous position taken by the entire Governing Council of the ECB. For this, we have two instruments. The first one is the flexibility introduced in the reinvestment of redemptions under the PEPP that is being used now. Second, we have the transmission protection instrument (TPI) that will enable purchases of bonds in jurisdictions with deteriorating financing conditions not justified by country-specific fundamentals. With these two instruments we are sending a very clear signal that we will not allow unjustified, unwarranted disorderly movements in sovereign bond markets should this pose a threat to the transmission of monetary policy.   Is the transmission protection instrument ready to be used if necessary?   Sure. We are ready to use it.   How does the ECB decide when a yield has deviated from the norm?  We have a whole range of indicators and different elements relating to financing conditions in countries, not just government bonds, that can help us understand when yields are justified or not. But there will be no automatic response, the Governing Council’s judgement will always be required.   The Portuguese Government has taken a very cautious approach in responding to inflation this year owing to the very high debt-to-GDP ratio. Some believe it should spend more. Do you agree with the Portuguese Government’s approach?  The Portuguese economy has recovered well, surpassing pre-pandemic levels earlier this year. The growth rate was expected at 6.3% this year and 2.6% in 2023 in our June projections. I would expect these figures to have come down a little given the overall deterioration of the economy. But the Portuguese economy shows overall robustness, with an unemployment rate below the euro area average. In that respect, I think that the outlook for the Portuguese economy is better than for other countries. When we look at fiscal policy indicators, government debt levels are high, but from a deficit standpoint (nominal and structural), the indicators are quite positive. The figures are very good, although this is partly due to inflation helping to increase revenues this year. I can’t comment on the political decisions of any country. However, in my view, Portugal’s fiscal policy is prudent and sensible. It creates leeway to support the groups hit hardest by inflation and the slowdown of the economy.   Do you think that monetary policy tightening will put pressure on the banking sector?   I think that we should not take the tightening of monetary policy as a single factor. The increase in interest rates is positive for the margins of European banks, including Portuguese banks. But, at the same time, we have to remember that the increase in interest rates will also affect banks’ funding costs. Also, we cannot overlook the fact that there is a slowdown of the economy, which will give rise to asset impairment and more defaults. The starting position of European and Portuguese banks is good in terms of capital and liquidity, but we should not fall into the delusion of believing that the increase in interest rates will solve the profitability problem of European and Portuguese banks.   How concerned is the ECB about the euro’s current exchange rate?   We do not target the exchange rate, but it is something we look at very carefully. The depreciation of the euro has had a negative impact on the cost of energy in euro. Further depreciation of the euro could be detrimental to inflationary pressures. On the contrary, if the euro stopped depreciating, this could be positive and support the fight against inflation. I hope that the recent depreciation trend is reversed in the near future.   "
2022-08-25,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Madame Figaro ,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Morgane Miel on 13 July 2022 and published on 25 August 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Madame Figaro    Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Morgane Miel on 13 July 2022 and published on 25 August 2022 25 August 2022  The past two years, which have also been the start of your term of office, have been challenging: on top of the public health crisis came the war in Ukraine and, in turn, the runaway inflation of recent months. What have they been like for you?  My feeling when I look back on these past few months is particularly one of always being on the lookout, always on alert. Yet when I took office in the autumn of 2019, my predecessor Mario Draghi had told me: “it will be relatively calm; we have restarted the asset purchase programme at a monthly pace of €20 billion and that should allow us to continue to fulfil our price stability objective”. Then in February 2020 at the G20 in Riyadh news began to reach us that towns and regions in northern Italy were being shut down in response to COVID-19. From then on, we were constantly in crisis response mode. The pandemic wasn’t strictly speaking in the ECB’s field but, out of necessity, we had to implement extremely swift and forceful monetary policy measures to enable economic activity to continue, even if in a half-slumber, and prevent the decimation of a whole swathe of the economy. Two years later, as the recovery was getting under way and we were seeing a stable outlook with a little breathing space, the war in Ukraine plunged us into crisis again.  Has it felt like you were losing control?  No, as there’s clearly some adrenaline flowing when you are in a crisis. In stormy conditions, all of your crew members are working to the best of their abilities and skills. The situation requires you to ignore petty rivalries and fears of stepping on each other’s toes. The crisis channels your energy and requires you to be able to motivate all your teams to work in the right direction. It encourages you to keep calm; this isn’t the time to raise abstract questions but rather to analyse the facts, try to tease out accurate information from the data available – which isn’t the easiest – and find the solutions.  Is there a particular moment that you remember?  Perhaps back in March 2020 when we devised the pandemic emergency purchase programme. Everything happened in the space of 48 hours. We were in a full lockdown and were working in conference calls, with the speakerphone but no screen. We had 25 decision-makers (the members of the Governing Council) on the line. One of my fellow Executive Board members lives in the same building as me and knocked at the door – he thought it was most likely going to be a late night so he had kindly stopped at the local bakery and brought some cakes with him. That evening we were both working at my kitchen table until the next morning. That’s how the programme started.  At what point did you think “it’s the right decision”?  I don’t necessarily think in those terms. There are 25 of us around the table – I’m not alone in making the decisions. What mattered most at the end of the night was the hope that we had done everything we could, that we had done our best.  You were Minister of the Economy and Finance in the midst of the sub-prime crisis when you were first interviewed for Madame Figaro. Then at short notice you replaced Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the International Monetary Fund, in circumstances we are all aware of. And with the pandemic, you have had to deal with a major recession. Have you ultimately found that you like the role of chief firefighter?  (Laughs) Moving from one crisis to the next makes you more resilient and better at reacting – at least I hope so. Something I’ve particularly noticed is that, by chance or out of necessity, women are often called on when there’s a crisis. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “a woman is like a teabag; you can’t tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water”. There’s some truth in that.  Your decisions have a direct impact on the lives of Europeans, making their loans more expensive and potentially reducing growth. Yet we also need to prevent another recession. Do you feel the weight of that responsibility?  Yes, absolutely. I still buy my groceries at the supermarket, pay my own bills, including my gas bills, and meet people at the market, as life here at the ECB can be a little removed, disconnected and punctuated with econometric models and projections. I move forwards with a sense of duty and humility. I’m not concerned about the outcome – I know we will return to an inflation rate close to 2%, but when? Over what time period? And what will the impact be? We can no longer rely exclusively on the projections provided by our models – they have repeatedly had to be revised upwards over these past two years. There are things that the models don’t capture. Sometimes the unexpected happens. So we have to pay attention to traditional indicators while also monitoring empirical data and what we expect to happen in terms of geopolitics, energy price developments and demographics.  That requires you to develop your own view…  Yes, that’s where the “element of judgement” comes in. I think I said that monetary policy was both a science and an art. We’re not machines or robots. Of course, we use the tools available to us, the aggregate data and the indicators that our models produce – but that isn’t enough.  How do you inform your analysis?  I’ve always tried to listen more than hear. So I listen and read a great deal, including in fields that I’m less familiar with as, unfortunately, the complexity of the world also lies in the fact that everyone is increasingly focused on their own field of expertise. I’m a firm believer in the virtue of diversity – not only gender diversity but also diversity of thought and skills – to understand that complexity.  Where do you find that diversity?  In art and culture – they are one of the strengths that unify us in Europe. I’m also supported by my children and grandchildren, who open up their world to me. One of my sons has a keen interest in space architecture – he’s now sending me lots of messages about telescopes so I read and look at things about that. And when my other son, who has two restaurants in Paris, tells me about his problems relating to operating statements or HR management, I’m also listening and learning. Other than that, I’m rereading both James Joyce’s Ulysses, which was given to me by the Irish Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe, and Homer’s Odyssey, as well as a few books on economics but, if truth be told, they aren’t quite as good a read.   How can we rebuild the world of tomorrow and create a sense of hope?  I think we are at a watershed moment triggered by the war in Ukraine. The horrific violence inflicted on the families on the ground has considerably raised awareness and has led us to review a number of priorities − especially as regards the fight against climate change, the need to speed up the transition to non-fossil and renewable energy sources. The war has also made us reflect on our relationship with others: the days of believing that we will forever be in a privileged and protected zone of peace are over. In economic terms, this means we must ask ourselves who we do business with and on what terms. Should we focus on exclusive sources of supply or diversify? I’m not in favour of deglobalisation, but rather of a neo-globalisation based on principles other than being ever cheaper and ever faster. I am convinced that the rationale of being ever more secure and ever nearer will prevail. And in this setting, Europe has a very strong position indeed.   Because the COVID-19 crisis simultaneously revealed and highlighted the malfunctioning of globalisation…  Absolutely. If I now ran a small, medium-sized or large business which received components from all over the world, and if I saw that transport costs were soaring, or that the security of the sources of supply depended on the lockdown rules applied by one government or another, I think that I would look very closely at my supply chain. Independence is achieved by diversifying sources of supply, and by seeking security through proximity.   How can we encourage the economy to become greener? How much room for manoeuvre do you have?   The general view here used to be that this topic falls outside the domain of central banks. When I was appointed to my position close on three years ago, I came with the conviction that I would of course do all my work on monetary policy, but that you could also count on me to address the topics of climate change and women’s issues. In fact, I made this clear during my confirmatory hearing at the European Parliament – and my appointment was approved, so doesn’t that give me the right to do what I said? Thanks to the intelligence and goodwill of the members of the ECB’s Executive Board and the governors, and after a good deal of persuasion, we have integrated the necessary struggle against climate change into the foundations of our strategy.   What do you mean by that?  We have an action plan with objectives, timelines and teams responsible for its implementation and we are making progress. In early July we presented some modifications to the way in which climate considerations are integrated into the econometric models that we use for monetary policy, as climate change is having a clear impact, especially on inflation. If more and more climate disasters, droughts and famines occur throughout the world, there will be repercussions on prices, on insurance premiums and on the financial sector. We need to take that into account.   You have also committed to greening our asset portfolio. What does that mean in practice?   It means that, in future, when we lend money to future debtors, we will require them to pledge more collateral for brown assets than for green assets if the former constitute a greater risk.   That implies that there are proven and comprehensive assessment criteria…  That’s true. We have assessment and rating systems which are developed internally and which we compare with existing ones. This should also encourage rating agencies to further incorporate these criteria. The problem is that there are scores of them and they vary across countries. Some are organised by line of business, others by geography. I can imagine that these environmental, social and governance standards will be harmonised and tightened rather quickly.   Will that be enough to avoid greenwashing?  The ECB’s supervisory arm will intervene there: we are already carrying out stress tests but we will subsequently need to get down to serious business. The good will and determination of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and of Emmanuel Faber at the head of the International Sustainability Standards Board for harmonising the “green standards” will allow us to clean things up a bit in respect of greenwashing. We will move towards stamping it out.   In many countries of the world, we see society splitting in two. You have repeatedly said that you find this concerning, especially from a political perspective. What can you do about that in your position?   What I can do best in my position is to lower inflation to restore price stability, and set a horizon. After that, it’s up to governments to do plenty of other necessary things. In an increasingly digitalised world, it’s essential that men and women can acquire sufficient knowledge, skills, and proficiency in using IT tools. This is obviously far more difficult for people who grow up in low-income single-parent families with limited access to technology. We need to bridge this gap through schooling; this is a massive task that, in my view, needs to be tackled.   It’s in all the headlines: people will be paying close attention to what you do in the coming next few months. What helps you cope with the pressure?   My family is a great support and always has been. And there’s a motto that I took from my time on the French national team for synchronised swimming: “Grit your teeth and smile”. That always works. And I believe my faith in people is unshakeable, as is simply my Faith. I’ve said before that love, and the confidence we draw from it, is what saves us. This may sound sentimental, yet it’s actually anything but: showering as much love and affection as we can on those who are having a hard time is what counts most.   By all accounts, at the helm of an organisation as complex as the ECB, your style of leadership is your main asset. How would you define it?    I try to be inclusive, to bring all potential contributors around the table. That’s how I do things. I come from an environment in which, as the head of a large international law firm (Baker McKenzie, ed.), you have to take this approach, because in a world of associates you don’t have any hierarchical authority. Everyone has to take ownership of their projects. And I think that is the best way to manage groups and get things done. I also think I’m someone who tells the truth, even to leaders. When I attended a G20 meeting as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, I was generally asked to speak at the beginning as I didn’t mince my words: I tell it like it is and I don’t try to embellish it.  On your bookshelf you have displayed the Ruth Bader Ginsburg Medal of Honor that was awarded to you. How did you react to the ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States to end the federal right to abortion?   I see it as a catastrophic legally argued decision for society in general and women in particular. Defending women’s rights is a daily struggle and you need to always stay on the alert and be on your guard. I will never forget Simone Veil who, when defending her bill in 1974, apologised, in a manner of speaking, for being a woman in an assembly of men. We can’t allow fundamental decisions to be taken by a large male majority; that is simply not on.   What would you like to say to our readers?   Help each other.    "
2022-08-18,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt on 16 August 2022","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt on 16 August 2022 18 August 2022  Please give us your assessment of growth and inflation developments since your last policy meeting.  The euro area economy is clearly slowing. Some of the downside risks that we identified in June are now materialising. Indicators like consumer or business confidence have declined further. The Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) have dropped notably, not only in manufacturing but also in services.  On the other hand, we had a relatively good second quarter, which shows that some pockets of resilience are supporting economic growth. Where is this resilience? One source is pent-up demand, which shows up particularly in services; tourism has probably been especially strong. This is likely going to carry over into the third quarter but it may fade towards the end of the year. We also have a very strong labour market. We see continued acute shortages of labour, historically low unemployment and a high number of vacancies. This probably implies that even if we enter a downturn, firms may be quite reluctant to shed workers on a broad scale. This will support household incomes. And finally, we have fiscal policy, which tries to compensate, at least in part, for the decline in real household income.  Nevertheless, there is a strong indication that growth is going to slow and I would not rule out that we enter a technical recession, especially if energy supplies from Russia are disrupted further. Downside risks to economic growth have also increased due to additional supply-side shocks, caused by droughts or the low water levels in major rivers. But there is country heterogeneity. It seems that, out of the larger euro area countries, Germany is hit the hardest.  During the pandemic, the economy adapted quite well to the new realities. Do you see scope for a similarly quick adjustment?   We have learned that the economy is able to adapt. But the energy price shock is too big to be fully offset.  If there is a recession, how persistent is it going to be?  I do not see any indication of a prolonged, deep recession at the moment. It’s not even clear that there's going to be a technical recession in the euro area at all. I would just not rule it out.   Where do you see inflation going and what are the implications of the persistent overshooting of inflation above expectations?  Headline inflation in the euro area increased again in July and now stands at 8.9%. Energy prices, particularly gas, and food prices are playing an important role. But it's much broader than that. We see high and increasing inflation rates in services and for non-energy industrial goods. It's a broad-based development. If you look at any of our measures of underlying inflation, they are moving up further and stand at historical highs.  These inflationary pressures are likely to be with us for some time; they won’t vanish quickly. Even with the ongoing monetary policy normalisation, it will take some time until inflation gets back to 2%.  But forecasting has proven quite hard in recent years and our staff are continuously working on improving the economic projections. There are some specific post-pandemic factors which we now try to take into account. For example, we have seen a relatively quick pass-through from energy prices and producer prices to consumer prices. We are also seeing an elevated level of refining margins.  Still, we have to be aware that any projection model will have a hard time dealing with fundamental structural shifts related to the pandemic, the war or the green transition. This speaks in favour of giving more weight to actual inflation outcomes in monetary policy decisions.  Where and when could inflation peak?  I would not exclude that, in the short run, inflation is going to increase further. But any projection is currently subject to high uncertainty. So it's very difficult to predict when inflation is going to peak.  What does it mean in practice that you should place greater emphasis on actual inflation in policy decisions?   Inflation projections play a key role in our monetary policy decisions. But we should not ignore what is happening at the moment. We have seen that our models have not been particularly good in projecting the future path of inflation. Therefore, current inflation outcomes provide additional, useful information.   Would higher inflation readings mean you need to raise your projections?   There are different factors at work. Economic growth, of course, has an impact on the inflation projection. Still, even if we entered a recession, it’s quite unlikely that inflationary pressures will abate by themselves. What we're seeing is a supply-side shock that is slowing growth and at the same time raising price pressures. The growth slowdown is then probably not sufficient to dampen inflation even if it reduces the price pressures due to slowing demand.  How will German government measures impact inflation?  In Germany it's relatively likely that inflation is going to move up further because some government measures that were used to fight inflation are going to be reversed or new measures introduced. These include the end of the nine-euro public transport ticket and of the fuel rebates, as well as the introduction of the natural gas levy.   Do you see a risk of inflation expectations getting de-anchored?  Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain around 2%. However, a number of indicators are pointing towards an elevated risk of de-anchoring. If you look at our household survey, the Consumer Expectations Survey, we can see that the median expectation of inflation three years ahead has edged up after having been anchored at 2% throughout the pandemic. We also see an upward movement in the Survey of Professional Forecasters. This increase has been very gradual, but sustained.  And maybe most importantly, we see that the right tail of these distributions has shifted upwards, meaning that an increasing share of survey respondents expect inflation to be well above our target. This is sometimes seen as an early warning indicator of de-anchoring. I think it's very important that we take such signs seriously.  What are the implications of this assessment for the September policy meeting?   Our monetary policy decisions are guided by the inflation outlook. We are currently seeing very high inflation rates. Our latest projected inflation numbers were also quite high and the factors driving inflation are not disappearing anytime soon.  This is why in July we embarked on monetary policy normalisation, which has just started and which is going to continue. In July we decided to raise rates by 50 basis points because we were concerned about the inflation outlook. At the same time, we shifted to a meeting-by-meeting approach, which means that any decision is going to be taken on the basis of incoming data.  If I look at the most recent data, I would say that the concerns we had in July have not been alleviated. In September, we're going to have an assessment of all the available data and we're going to have new staff projections.   What would be your preference for September?  It's not about preference, it's about what is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2% over the medium term. In July we decided on a 50 basis point hike in light of the inflation outlook. At the moment I do not think this outlook has changed fundamentally.  Could the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) allow for larger rate hikes?   I would not put it that way. TPI is not an instrument for adjusting our monetary policy stance; it's an instrument that deals with risks to monetary policy transmission. So, I would like to separate the two things. We need to decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance in order to bring inflation down to 2% over the medium term. And then TPI ensures that this desired monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across the euro area.   Markets price about 110 basis points of rate hikes this year and a total of 145 basis points until the peak of the cycle. Are you comfortable with those expectations?  We have moved to a meeting-by-meeting approach, so we’ve moved away from giving any precise forward guidance on the future path of interest rates. The broad direction of policy is pretty clear, but we don’t want to give particular guidance due to the high level of uncertainty. Forward guidance still remains part of our toolkit. It is particularly beneficial when the economy is close to the effective lower bound. Then forward guidance allows for additional easing, even when one cannot lower interest rates further.  Where is the neutral rate and would that be enough to get inflation down or do you need to go into restrictive territory?  At this point in time, the level of the neutral rate is not the relevant question. Real short-term rates remain in deep negative territory, meaning we are quite far away from the point where our policy becomes restrictive. It is also not easy to operationalise the neutral rate in monetary policy decisions because estimates are surrounded by large uncertainty. I think it's a useful theoretical concept but in practical terms, it doesn't help us much.    Is it time to discuss ending asset purchase programme reinvestments?   This is something we haven’t discussed yet. We have followed our pre-announced sequencing, which stipulated that we were going to hike interest rates before ending reinvestments under the asset purchase programme (APP). But, of course, the size of our balance sheet is an integral part of our regular monetary policy stance discussions.  Could this be on the agenda for September?   I cannot tell you what my colleagues are going to say in the September meeting, but I wouldn't rule out someone bringing this up.   How does the weak euro figure into your calculus?   We do not comment on the level of the exchange rate. But persistent exchange rate movements matter for monetary policy because they have an impact on the inflation outlook. The euro has depreciated notably, particularly vis-à-vis the US dollar. This matters even more when facing an energy price shock, because a large share of euro area energy imports is invoiced in US dollars.  In the past ECB studies argued that the exchange rate pass-through to inflation has diminished over time. Could that be changing now?   I would argue that, in this particular situation of an energy supply shock, the exchange rate matters more.  PEPP reinvestments were skewed towards several southern European countries in June and July. Should we expect this trend to continue in August.  The reinvestment flexibility under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) helps us counter fragmentation risks and risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. The use of this instrument, like that of any of our instruments, has to be proportionate. This implies that the activation of the tool is going to happen only to the extent necessary. At the beginning of the pandemic we saw that short intervention periods can be sufficient in order to stabilise markets.  Can you spell out the difference between the trigger for using PEPP reinvestment flexibly and the trigger for activating TPI?   I would frame it somewhat differently because these are different tools. The PEPP deals with risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. It is a temporary tool, which is important.  The other tool, TPI, is different in several respects. It is a permanent tool and the purchase volumes are not restricted ex ante. At the same time, it requires a broader assessment. In particular, it requires an assessment of various eligibility criteria related to compliance with the EU fiscal framework, macroeconomic imbalances, fiscal sustainability and sound macroeconomic policies.  The Governing Council has to decide which tool to use under which circumstances. It also has to check the relevant criteria for these tools. And importantly, it has to make sure that the use of the tools is proportionate.  Proportionality implies three things. We have to show that the tool is effective, i.e. that it serves its purpose. We have to demonstrate that the tool is efficient, so there is no other tool that can achieve the same objective at lower costs. And, finally, the potential benefits have to  outweigh the potential costs or side effects.   Are any of these criteria must haves?   All of them are very important. In the end, the decision always rests with the Governing Council. But at the same time, we have to take these eligibility criteria very seriously to ensure that we remain firmly within our mandate and legal framework.  But failing one criterion does not automatically exclude the country and it's still ultimately the Governing Council's discretion?  It's the Governing Council's decision but all the criteria should be met.  Is there any country currently in the euro area that does not meet all the criteria?  Such an assessment would only take place at a time when the Governing Council considers it appropriate to activate the tool.  Do you see undue fragmentation in the market right now?   Markets are more stable today, but August is always an unusual period as many traders are on vacation. Volatility remains elevated and liquidity is low. We monitor markets carefully.  PEPP reinvestments are now deviating from the capital key. Is this a permanent deviation?   Capital key deviations are relatively small. Adjustments to our asset holdings would need to avoid any interference with the monetary policy stance and with the smooth transmission of monetary policy.  Do you plan to sterilise TPI purchases?  We announced that TPI purchases must not interfere with the monetary policy stance. That implies that we need to avoid any persistent effect on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet and on excess liquidity. There are different ways to do that. But so far we haven't been explicit about what we will do because this will be decided if and when the TPI is activated.   "
2022-07-29,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Postimees,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Tõnis Oja on 25 July","  INTERVIEW  Interview with Postimees   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Tõnis Oja on 25 July 29 July 2022  Last Thursday, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to increase the key interest rates by 0.5 percent, which differed from the initial plan to increase rates by 0.25 percent. But has it not come too late? Other major central banks reacted to inflation much earlier.  We started the normalisation of our monetary policy in December, when we decided to halt our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and the asset purchase programme (APP), later in June. These decisions were taken in line with the data received and the uncertainty about the outlook. The Russian invasion of Ukraine further added to that uncertainty. Moreover, according to our forward guidance, ending bond purchases was a necessary first step before we could raise interest rates. Our decision last week to increase rates by 50 basis points instead of 25 is a result of a combination of factors. The main one was the continued acceleration of inflation in June. From now on, we will analyse the situation within the Governing Council on a meeting-by-meeting basis depending on the data we receive.  In Estonia, there is a general belief that the main cause of high inflation in the euro area is the ECB’s asset purchase programme (QE), or in other words money printing.  I think there are a variety of elements behind the evolution of inflation. First, the increase in energy and commodity prices, which is affecting inflation worldwide; second, systemic supply-side shocks; and third, the sharp increase in demand as the European economy reopened after the pandemic. Therefore, inflation is not due to a single factor, but to a combination of factors.  As the effects of the pandemic fade away, the exceptional fiscal and monetary policies that were needed should be gradually normalised.   I think the ECB is in a very complicated situation. On the one hand, steep inflation requires higher interest rates; on the other hand, we are going to face a difficult winter and possibly an energy crisis. However, the increase in interest rates puts an additional burden on indebted businesses and households.  Indeed, the outlook is complicated right now. The recent projections of the European Commission clearly show a slowdown in growth, while inflation is expected to remain high in the coming months. Therefore, we are going to face a combination of slow growth and high inflation. It is important to bear in mind that the ECB’s mandate is to maintain price stability at two per cent over the medium term, to which we are fully committed. Therefore, the main factor that will guide our decisions will be the evolution of inflation.  Several euro area governments, for example Spain, Portugal and especially Italy, have a very high debt level. I understand that the task of the ECB’s new tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), is to deal with the differences between bond interest rates (spreads) in different countries becoming too wide.  The TPI was designed to ensure that the monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. It should address unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that could threaten the transmission. We hope that we won’t have to use it, but if we do, we will not hesitate.  Clearly, fiscal positions are heterogeneous among the different EU Member States. But the situation is not comparable to the one 10 to 12 years ago, at the time of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. For example, if we look at the competitiveness of the southern European economies, we see it has strengthened significantly. The divergences are not as big as they were back then. Fiscal reforms have been introduced, macroeconomic imbalances significantly reduced. The institutional framework is also stronger with the banking union, even if it is still incomplete. Currently, we have a much clearer framework for dealing with any potential crisis, as we witnessed, for example, during the pandemic. But fiscal policy has an important role to play at present along with monetary policy, in avoiding the emergence of unwarranted fragmentation.   Is it possible to have a successful unified monetary policy in such different countries – for example, on the one hand, Germany and Estonia, which have a low level of debt, and Italy on the other hand, with a very high level of debt?  The euro is not only an economic or a financial project, it is also the most important political project in the European Union, which keeps us united. We should not underestimate the political will behind the European project that will be able to overcome the difficulties that we are currently facing. Divergences amongst countries can also be a source of diversity and enrich the monetary union. But, in any case, the gaps are not the same as they were a decade ago. Fiscal policy has a very important role to play. Highly indebted countries must reduce their fiscal debt gradually according to their specific situation. On the monetary policy side, we have to monitor inflation very carefully, because, while in some countries, like Estonia, inflation is very high, there are other countries where inflation is considerably lower – around 6%. It is our duty to act for the euro area as a whole.  Markets are very worried about the situation in Italy. Will we see another economic crisis in the near future?  The institutional framework is very different from what it was a decade ago. Beyond the banking union, we have launched Next Generation EU to support EU Member States’ recovery from the pandemic, which is yet another sign of European unity in the face of crises. A new instrument, the TPI, to deal with unwarranted fragmentation in the euro area, has also been added to the rich central banking toolbox. I cannot comment on the political situation of specific countries. But in terms of monetary policy and financial stability, we are united and committed to fulfilling our mandate. We hope countries and governments will apply the correct fiscal and structural policies in line with the EU’s recovery plan.  The euro exchange rate has fallen almost to parity with the US dollar. Is it a problem?  We at the ECB don’t target the exchange rate. But it is a very important macroeconomic indicator that we take into account when making our projections. Undoubtedly, the depreciation of the euro has been one of the factors behind the high inflation and the rise in energy prices denominated in euro. The exchange rate was of course considered in our discussion last week, as we are aware of its impact on the evolution of inflation.    "
2022-06-16,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Dein SPIEGEL,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Dein Spiegel on 19 May 2022 ","  Interview  Interview with Dein SPIEGEL   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Dein Spiegel on 19 May 2022  16 June 2022    Lots of people are talking about inflation these days. But what exactly is it?   Inflation is an increase in prices across the board, so not just for individual items, but for many different ones. You may have noticed that some things have become more expensive recently.   Yes, petrol, sunflower oil, a scoop of ice cream…  Exactly. All of us see that in many parts of everyday life. One of the reasons for it is the coronavirus (COVID-19). The economy came to a halt at the start of the pandemic. People stopped going to the hairdresser’s, to the cinema or on vacations. Many wanted to spend their money on other things instead: tablets and computers were in particularly high demand, for example, not least for home schooling. But manufacturers were either unable to produce their goods quickly enough or could not deliver them owing to the pandemic. Demand was higher than the available supply, explaining why many businesses raised their prices.   Does it also have to do with the war in Ukraine?   Yes, it does. The European Union has said that it wants to become less dependent on Russian energy. Up to now we have bought a lot of comparably cheap oil and gas from there. We now want to switch to other sources of energy, many of which are more expensive. On top of that, large amounts of wheat were cultivated in Ukraine. As farmers can now neither sow their crops nor ship out their harvest, prices are soaring. That not only is a problem for us in Europe, but also for many poorer countries.   Why is it dangerous for inflation to be too high?   Many people, particularly those on lower incomes, need to carefully plan how to get by on their salaries. If their heating or petrol bills increase sharply, but their salaries remain more or less the same, they don’t know how to pay those bills. They will then be able to afford less overall. It’s especially difficult if prices rise faster and faster, as happened in Germany around 100 years ago. Prices raced up virtually by the second, becoming so high that you needed a laundry basket full of banknotes to pay for one loaf of bread. That shall not happen again: that’s why it’s so important to have the European Central Bank.   So what is the ECB’s main task?   Our objective is to keep prices stable in the euro area, in other words, wherever the euro is the official currency. We cannot prevent every price increase, but prices should not climb up too high for too long. That is how we retain trust in the value of money. In former times people used to pay in gold coins. Gold is valuable, whereas the paper used for euro banknotes has practically no value. But banknotes are valuable nevertheless. When we buy goods, the sellers accept euro banknotes because they know that others will also recognise their value – this trust forms the basis of our monetary system.   What can the ECB do about inflation?  We can adjust interest rates. The interest rate is the price that you pay when borrowing money from a bank. Many people take out a loan when they buy a house and firms borrow money in order to buy new machines. If interest rates increase, borrowing money becomes more expensive. Houses and machines are then less in demand – and the prices for them consequently fall. That’s how we can steer inflation. We meet every six weeks to discuss whether we should change interest rates.  Why haven’t they been raised up to now?  We assumed that manufacturers would soon produce more goods and would be able to deliver them more rapidly. Inflation would then have largely eased off automatically. But in fact the unusually high level of inflation has now been persisting for much longer than expected. That is why we will soon raise interest rates.   What have interest rates got to do with our savings?     Interest is not only what you pay to the bank for borrowing money. It also works the other way around: the bank pays interest to you when you lend money by depositing it in a bank account. But over the past few years, savers have often received no interest at all on their deposits. That was not only because of the ECB, but also because people all over the world wanted to save so much, for their retirement, for example – even at very low interest rates. That’s why interest rates everywhere were rather low.   How much money does the ECB actually have?  We always have as much money as we need, because a central bank can create money itself. People’s trust in our money depends on how we deal with that responsibility.   Do you have a machine for printing money in the basement, or how do you go about it?   Most of the money that we bring into circulation is created electronically – for example, when we lend money to a bank and transfer that amount to the bank’s account.   Could the ECB produce enough money to solve all of Europe’s problems?   That is not possible. First, it’s up to the national governments to solve the problems in their own countries. We are not allowed to do so and are independent of politics. Second, if we bring more and more money into circulation, prices will go up. That would go against our mandate of keeping prices stable.   Should children be asking for more pocket money because of the rise in prices?   This could be a good time to negotiate with your parents. You could calculate how many cinema tickets or ice cream scoops you can buy with your pocket money now and demonstrate that you can’t afford as many as you could before. Keep in mind though that the high inflation rate also means that your parents themselves have less to spend.   Have your children already asked for more money?   We haven’t spoken about that yet, but this interview might give them the idea!    "
2022-06-16,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Ta Nea,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Maria Vasileiou","  Interview  Interview with Ta Nea   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Maria Vasileiou 16 June 2022  What prompted the decisions taken last week and what sort of interest rate hikes should we expect following the first one in July?  Inflation is very high. Our projections indicate that it will only gradually start coming down later this year, remaining above our target throughout the projection horizon. Inflation is more persistent and broad-based than we thought some months ago, but it will continue declining in 2023 and 2024. The Governing Council has indicated that it is fully committed to taking inflation back to our definition of price stability – 2% over the medium term – and has started the normalisation process. That includes ending net purchases under the asset purchase programme as of 1 July. And we have also provided forward guidance on interest rates by signalling two increases for July and September. We intend to raise rates by 0.25% at our meeting on 21 July. For September, we can consider a bigger increase, if the inflation outlook persists or deteriorates. Our future decisions will be data-driven.  There has been criticism, partly because the Fed and the Bank of England started adjusting their policies earlier, that the ECB’s rate hike is coming rather late in the day…  First, let me stress that we started responding to inflation several months ago. In December we decided to discontinue net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March. And the economic situation in the euro area is not the same as in other parts of the world. The current bout of inflation is a global phenomenon, although it started to affect Europe a little later than elsewhere, which explains why our response has been a little later than in other jurisdictions. As soon as we saw that inflation was becoming more entrenched, we acted swiftly and decisively. Unlike in the euro area, domestic demand appears to have been a stronger driver of inflation in the United States.  Are you concerned about secondary pressures?  This is a risk that we have to take into consideration. Inflation is going to be higher than expected for a longer period. The longer it remains high, the greater the likelihood of second-round effects. So far we haven’t seen large increases in wage claims and settlements, but we need to monitor that situation very closely.  The ECB’s macroeconomic projections have been revised significantly downwards. Is there a risk of a recession?  We revised the growth outlook downwards for 2022 and 2023 because of the impact of the war in Ukraine and because of the deterioration in the terms of trade resulting from the increase in commodity and energy prices. We now have to earmark a larger part of euro area income for spending on these more expensive factors of production as a result. In terms of net income, households and businesses will be poorer than before the war. This factor is reflected in our growth projections. Our baseline scenario indicates, though, that we will not have a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth). But we will have low growth. In more extreme situations – such as severely disrupted energy supplies, as assumed in our downside scenario – growth would turn negative in 2023.  Sovereign bond yields are rising. Is there a risk of financial fragmentation, and what tools might be used if reinvesting PEPP proceeds is not enough to prevent it? Do you think that markets will test you?  Fragmentation – or the impaired transmission of monetary policy – has always been a concern for the Governing Council. The PEPP was launched with flexibility in mind, and this applies to the PEPP reinvestment phase as well. We also decided yesterday to mandate the relevant Eurosystem Committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council. Markets should have no doubts about how determined we are to address fragmentation.  Greece is about to exit enhanced surveillance. You dealt with the Greek crisis as a member of the Eurogroup. How do you see Greece’s economic situation now?  The turnaround in the Greek economy has been impressive. The difference between the situation we had six or seven years ago and the one we have now is like night and day. Today, there is confidence in the Greek economy. This is a clear sign of Greece’s improvement, most notably in three areas. First, its economy is now more competitive thanks to the structural reforms implemented. Second, it enjoys a better fiscal position. And third, the Greek banking system is more resilient in terms of its capital and liquidity position.  But there are vulnerabilities. The Government should continue strengthening the country’s fiscal position in the medium term by achieving successive primary surpluses, while the banking system should continue trying to reduce the level of non-performing loans. The times ahead won’t be easy – we will have higher inflation, lower growth, higher interest rates and higher yields. But I am confident that Greece will deal with these challenges successfully.  How are euro area banks faring in the current situation?  European banks have been able to navigate the pandemic, and they should also be able to navigate the challenges that the war is posing. They are better capitalised and more resilient than they were. While higher interest rates might in the short term help banks’ profitability by increasing their margins, the shift from floating to fixed-rate lending by some banks in recent years may offset some of these benefits. Not all banks are the same. Some are more sensitive to rising interest rates. The profitability and solvency of businesses might also be affected by the combination of lower growth, higher interest rates and increased input prices, raising asset quality concerns. Looking further ahead, the situation of households and businesses is going to be key as credit risk concerns resurface.   "
2022-05-30,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Cinco Días,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Nuño Rodrigo and Laura Salces on 25 May 2022","  Interview  Interview with Cinco Días   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Nuño Rodrigo and Laura Salces on 25 May 2022 30 May 2022  What has happened in the ECB’s Governing Council during the past few weeks? This week President Lagarde has signalled a shift from indicating a rate increase some time after the end of asset purchases to two rate hikes by the end of September.  As we have always said, there is a clear sequence. The fulfilment of the conditions to end asset purchases in the third quarter, which starts in July, has become increasingly clear. And the next step sets up the expectation of when to raise rates and what the increases will look like.  I think it was important for President Lagarde to lay out a roadmap signalling the end of net asset purchases in July and the end of negative interest rates in September. It is a robust and appropriate decision, although it is too early to know what will happen after that, as it will depend on how the economy evolves.   It is unusual for the President of the ECB to provide such a clear roadmap. Does the ECB feel under pressure to act?  It is important for people to understand our thinking. The two months between the April and June meetings were probably too long not to give any guidance. I think it was very good timing for President Lagarde to lay out a roadmap. The roadmap includes ending quantitative easing at the start of the third quarter and then two rate increases in July and September, so that by the end of the third quarter we have moved out of negative rates. Of course, we have meetings coming up in June, July and September, but given the high uncertainty we’re facing, it is important to set good expectations.  Could there be a 50-basis point hike in the July meeting?  What we see today is that it is appropriate to move out of negative rates by the end of the third quarter, and that the process should be gradual. Normalisation has a natural focus on moving in units of 25 basis points, so increases of 25 basis points in the July and September meetings are a benchmark pace. Any discussion about other moves would have to make the case for moving more strongly than this sequence of hikes in July and September. The discussion will be had, but our current assessment of the situation, where we think the medium-term inflation outlook is in line with our two per cent target, calls for a gradual approach to normalisation.  The current nature of inflation creates a dilemma: some people think the rate hike will come too late, whereas others think it’s not so urgent, as the inflation is driven by the supply side rather than the demand side. What do you think?   Our roadmap is robust and covers a range of different interpretations of what’s going on – on one side, the view that inflation is exclusively due to a supply shock and, on the other, the view of those who believe that there is a big domestic demand component.  Moving out of negative rates in September makes sense under either interpretation. This debate will continue in the autumn, and at that point we’ll have more information and will know more about the dynamic of inflation and second-round effects on wages. With more time, we will find out more about the balance between supply and demand, between temporary and longer-term factors. Taking the first steps is appropriate under a range of hypotheses, and we will know more over the coming months about the next steps after that.  Is the depreciation of the euro a factor in the recent update to the roadmap?    There has been a movement against the US dollar but there have also been opposing movements against other currencies, so on a trade-weighted basis the euro has moved much less. But regardless, the exchange rate is very important for the euro area economy and for its exporting firms, including those in Spain. But it would be a mistake to only focus on one of the factors affecting import prices. The exchange rate matters in many ways, so we consider it in our projections, together with all the other factors that are shaping the economy.  Will there be an upward revision to inflation projections and a downward revision to growth expectations in June? The most recent projections were published just two weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine.  The impact of the war is becoming increasingly visible in the European Commission’s recent projections and those of other economic institutions. In the near term, directionally, there is an upward pressure on inflation and a negative impact on growth. But for monetary policy, how we assess the medium term is very important, so not only 2022 but also 2023 and 2024. We need to go beyond the immediate impact and analyse the medium-term effects of factors like high prices today leading to lower incomes and lower demand.   Are we now closer to the adverse inflation scenario that you talked about in March – of 7.1 per cent this year?  I don’t think that’s the way to look at it. The baseline scenario changes with each set of quarterly projections. In June we will have an updated baseline, which will reflect all the factors that affect the economy. We take into account the uncertainty created by the war, which is weighing on GDP, as well as the recovery from the pandemic. It’s important to remember that all the factors are at work, rather than just focusing on one element.  Is there a risk of recession in 2023 or later? The ECB is going to raise rates, and this risks damaging growth.  The European Commission has already significantly downgraded growth for this year. But because of the recovery from the pandemic, there is a natural momentum in the economy. The euro area economy is still projected to grow, although at a slower rate than was expected. Even without a recession the war is having a sizeable impact on the euro area. In any case, we are moving towards a normalisation of monetary policies that were introduced to fight excessively-low inflation. It is more a withdrawal of stimulus than a monetary tightening. Monetary policy is still going to be supportive. Moving out of negative rates in September does not mean that interest rates are going to be high – these are still going to be relatively supportive. It’s a pathway to normalisation.  What would be the neutral interest rate for the eurozone?    The ECB would look at this, of course, like many others. There are calculations of the equilibrium real interest rates. As you can see in previous speeches I have given, but also others, these are projected to be very low, negative in many calculations and around zero in others. I appreciate that investors want to predict where the neutral interest rate will be, but for us as a central bank the important focus is on a pathway where essentially we will be moving rates and then we’ll be simultaneously assessing the inflation dynamic. Rates will settle down when inflation settles around two per cent, and we should be open-minded where that will be. We’re going meeting by meeting, quarter by quarter. As President Lagarde has said, we can move more quickly if inflation pressures are high and more slowly if there are downside risks to inflation. So that’s our focus, not the academic debate on where the so-called neutral interest rate is. And if you look at the history of monetary policy, this approach reflects a more normal monetary policy situation.  Sovereign bond yields are rising rapidly, and risk premia too. Is there reason to be worried about the risk of financial fragmentation?  In December we essentially started normalisation by confirming that net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) would end in March. And we were already explicit at the time that we would be flexible in our monetary policy in the future. We are not going to ignore fragmentation risk – clearly, we know it is something that was very damaging in the past. We are monitoring fragmentation risk continuously and, within our mandate, we are committed to preventing it.  In 2012 Mario Draghi wasn’t talking about fragmentation but about redenomination risk. The yields of Spanish and Italian bonds were very different to what they are now but, in terms of market fragmentation, where is the pain threshold?    I think the pain threshold in terms of risk premia has to be evaluated in the particular circumstances we find ourselves in. It’s not as simple as giving a fixed number at which point we would intervene. We have to always be monitoring what is going on, assessing the sources of movements in yields and the basis for intervention.   Does the ECB need a contingency tool to address this risk of financial fragmentation? Or can you address it just by adjusting the PEPP reinvestments?  In the last Governing Council meeting we said that we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term. Flexibility is a general concept. One application is through the PEPP reinvestments, but there are also other instruments that could be used. The debate about what type of instrument could be used is a secondary one – the bottom line is the commitment that we will not let unwarranted impairment of the transmission mechanism interfere with monetary policy and our ability to deliver our target.  Spain and Italy are among the most vulnerable countries in the euro area. Are we prepared to weather higher financing costs?    The Spanish and Italian economies are stronger than they were ten years ago. There has been a very significant recovery. Over the medium term it’s difficult to overstate the impact of the Next Generation EU funds, which will be a very important anchor for economic activity. Another recovery path is through the normalisation of tourism, and here Spain and Italy will be among the countries that benefit the most. Also, across Europe, we are not witnessing the very severe imbalances seen during the financial crisis. We also talked about the equilibrium interest rate. The market is not expecting interest rates to return anywhere near those levels that were problematic in that period.  What do you think of the suspension of the fiscal rules for this year and 2023?  The European Commission’s baseline scenario is that the euro area economy will be growing this year and next. But there are risks that the situation might deteriorate owing to the war, and so it makes sense for the escape clause to be extended for another year. This does not mean that fiscal policy should be loosened – it’s more a question of risk management. And remember that many programmes that were launched during the pandemic are now finishing and tax revenue is expected to recover, which should lead to an improvement in fiscal positions. When the war is over and the uncertainty fades, we will have to make sure that there is a clear framework to reduce debt ratios gradually. By and large, fiscal policy should be moving towards a neutral setting under the baseline.  Just like monetary policy?  Yes, essentially. Many private sector activities were restricted during the pandemic, and these should be recovering now. We are in a world where fiscal policy can step back a little bit.  You mentioned some tailwinds, especially for the Spanish economy, like tourism and the Next Generation EU funds. What are the headwinds that the ECB is working against?  Internally, the energy shock is a big challenge for Europe, which imports a lot of energy. Collectively, Europe has less disposable income, and that means lower demand for many sectors. And externally, the uncertainty about the evolution of the world economy and the war in Ukraine is a risk factor.  Crypto-assets have undergone a severe correction, a drop which comes at the same time as the ECB’s warnings about their correlation with the financial sector. How big is the threat to financial stability?  The assessment is that the European financial system is not overexposed to cryptocurrencies. But we should prepare, and that’s why having regulation and providing more information to consumers is important. The sharp fall in crypto-assets is a wake-up call for many investors who had speculated in some of these products and experienced significant losses.  What are your greatest concerns about crypto-assets?  Our diagnosis is essentially that everything that has happened recently is due to pure speculation. What we have now are new technologies, which may be promising but highly volatile in a world with no regulation. We need to develop good regulation for digital finance. A digital euro, issued by a central bank, would allow many of these technologies to play a very beneficial and regulated role.  Could what has happened with digital assets harm the development of the digital euro?  No, I don’t think so. These are different concepts. The narrative that a private sector invention can replace the official currency of a state just doesn’t hold up. The digital euro would be one-to-one with cash and with money in the commercial banking system, which is entirely different to some kind of engineered product that relies on some algorithm or imperfect mechanism.   What’s the time frame for the digital euro?  We’re in an investigation phase now, but it’s a process that could take around five years.  A clearer roadmap, which we should have sooner rather than later, will be helpful for everyone involved in the project. We have to make the right decisions, and this also involves the European Commission and the Member States.  The pandemic and now the war in Ukraine are causing huge changes in the economic and geopolitical landscape. How do you think the euro area is prepared for this new world?  Having a single currency is extremely beneficial. It’s a very effective way of dealing with these global shocks, and very different to each country having to cope with the pandemic or the war in Ukraine by itself. Europeans appreciate that it’s important to have a common currency and to take collective decisions. Europe should be able to make its own decisions. And the ECB can deliver this. Thanks to the euro, we have a great deal of control to deliver price stability and to contribute to the objectives of the European Union.   "
2022-05-07,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Delo,"<a id=""_Hlk102419315""></a>Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Miha Jenko and published on 7 May 2022 ","  Interview  Interview with Delo     Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Miha Jenko and published on 7 May 2022  7 May 2022  Ms Lagarde, the world has changed considerably over the past two and a half months. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated again that our world is in constant flux, as you said in one of your public appearances. As a European, how do you see the nature of the current challenges from a purely human perspective?   Russia’s unacceptable and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine has both confirmed the importance of the peace project that is the construction of Europe and underlined the fact that it is not yet complete, including in areas such as defence and fiscal coordination. But I am proud as a European to see the surge in solidarity across our continent.  You indicated in discussions at the recent IMF meeting in Washington, D.C. that there is an increased risk of slower economic growth and higher inflation this year. To what extent is this due to the wider economic consequences of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and what other risks are influencing your assessment?   The war in Ukraine is first and foremost a human tragedy. And it has economic consequences beyond Ukraine. It is weighing on growth and boosting inflation. However, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic also continues to weigh on growth with the recent resurgence of infections in China and the effects of new lockdowns on economic activity. At the same time, economic activity is still being supported by the reopening of the economy following the crisis phase of the pandemic, notably in the services sector.   Does your institution already have any concrete quantitative or “hard” data on the impact of this war so far on the euro area economy, GDP, inflation, exports, etc.?  We have the preliminary figures for economic growth in the first quarter of 2022, which are slightly lower than those for the fourth quarter of 2021. And the latest inflation reading showed that energy costs, which have risen following the invasion of Ukraine but also following the recovery from the pandemic, were 38% higher in April than a year ago. But it is important to take a comprehensive view of these data and to look ahead at our projection horizon.   The ECB is drawing up new macroeconomic projections for its June monetary policy meeting. With inflation on the rise, do you perhaps expect the more severe scenario that your analysts prepared back in March to materialise?   It is still too early to tell. As always, our staff projections are produced at the Eurosystem level in June and December. Our teams are working intensively on these projections. We will have this information at our Governing Council meeting on 9 June, when we take a decision on the path of monetary policy.   How realistic is stagflation in Europe currently, and what are the risks?  Stagflation is not currently our baseline. Although the unusual degree of uncertainty could mean a combined slowdown in growth amid high inflation, the current situation cannot be compared to that of the 1970s. At that time the decline in economic growth following the first oil shock was considerable – 8 percentage points – and inflation was higher than today. Moreover, back then wage increases in response to inflation fuelled the price growth. We are not seeing that today.   Would you agree that the impact of the war in Ukraine poses a particular challenge for Europe, as it is more vulnerable in terms of energy than the United States or China?  The fallout from the war between Russia and Ukraine has highlighted the deep security and trade vulnerabilities in Europe, some of which were already apparent during the pandemic. Our vulnerabilities have been most evident in the area of energy security. EU countries have a relatively high degree of dependence on Russia for their energy supplies. In 2020 the EU imported over 40% of its total gas supply from Russia. This has improved recently.   Eurostat’s latest data for April indicate growing differences in annual inflation rates across euro area countries. The euro area average is currently 7.5% – which is also roughly the rate in Slovenia – but in some member countries (for instance the Baltic nations and the Netherlands), inflation is already well above 10%. Will the ECB respond to potential asymmetric shocks, for instance through a common stabilisation function to mitigate the uneven economic impact of the war in Ukraine on individual Member States?   The task of the European Central Bank is to maintain price stability in the euro area. There are proposals at the EU level for common initiatives to prevent energy prices from increasing disproportionately. But these are initiatives that need to be considered at the level of governments: a central bank has little to say or contribute on this matter.     The ECB hasn’t raised its key interest rate for nearly 11 years. A hike is now only a matter of time, and financial observers are trying to guess whether you will raise rates in July, September or December. To be precise, I’m not asking which month, but about the circumstances that would convince you and your colleagues at the ECB that this move is necessary. What conditions would need to be met for the ECB’s Governing Council to say, well, now is really the time to raise interest rates?   We have a clearly defined sequence of events. First, we will have to end net purchases under the asset purchase programme. Judging by the incoming data, my expectation is that net asset purchases should be concluded early in the third quarter. Adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of net purchases and will be gradual. The first rate increase will be determined by the ECB Governing Council, informed by the forward guidance it has decided, and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.    What kind of interest rate policy will the ECB conduct after the first rate rise? Increasing the price of money alone probably won’t be enough to bring inflation down to the ECB’s symmetrical target of around 2%. Some previous estimates indicate this goal could be reached towards the end of next year, while others suggest not before 2024. How do you envisage the timeline for meeting this goal? Which factors and risks will be decisive in this regard?  Rather than giving you a series of dates and figures, I will focus here on three general principles that will guide us to price stability over the medium term: optionality to allow us to respond to different scenarios in an uncertain context, gradualism to allow us to act prudently, and flexibility to ensure that our monetary policy decisions are transmitted evenly to all parts of the euro area.   An interest rate rise will, combined with other factors, increase member countries’ borrowing costs, and this is already happening. Could this be a problem going forward? Is the euro area more robust now that it has more mechanisms to potentially support countries in debt distress?   The euro area is certainly more robust today than it was ten years ago. Its construction has been strengthened in many areas, such as banking supervision and the progress towards banking union. The pandemic also led to a common fiscal response by European countries, which showed solidarity during the pandemic as well as when Russia invaded Ukraine.   During the financial crisis considerable efforts and public money were required to bail out banks in both the euro area and Slovenia. How are euro area banks faring in the current situation of heightened risks?   Even though the credit risk outlook for banks is likely to deteriorate owing to the indirect effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine, and because the full financial impact of COVID-19 hasn’t yet fully materialised, the banking sector is well prepared, thanks to its strong capital and liquidity position.  Core capital ratios are at almost the highest level since the establishment of banking union, and banks also have ample liquidity buffers reaching levels far above regulatory minimums. Banks’ asset quality and profitability also improved during 2021, with return on equity reaching the highest level in five years. The non-performing loan ratio continued to decline to a level slightly above 2% at the end of 2021.     Some believe that your predecessor, Mr Draghi, with his historic statement that the ECB would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, may have prevented the very break-up of the euro area during the financial crisis. What are you prepared to do to protect the euro?  As the guardian of the euro, there are no limits to our commitment to our mandate and to the single currency. We have proven this time and again when we have faced crises that have threatened the integrity of our monetary union and, therefore, price stability. Our unprecedented response to the pandemic is only the latest example.  Do you, as President, enjoy support in the Governing Council? Are decisions unanimous?   Consensus is formed by respecting each other, listening to everyone’s points of view and reaching compromises. I am careful to ensure that different opinions are expressed. It is by fostering the expression of different views that progress can be made to achieve the best outcome. In spring 2020 the situation was quite unprecedented, as less than six months into my presidency, pandemic-related health measures prevented Governing Council members from physically meeting in the same meeting room. But this did not prevent us from reviewing our monetary policy strategy, adopting a new strategy unanimously and taking important decisions – sometimes in rather unexpected venues, such as in March 2020, when we decided on the emergency pandemic measures around my kitchen table. I think everybody recognises that without these interventions the economic effects of the pandemic would have been much more severe.   It seems that, by force of circumstance, you are also a crisis manager. You took office a few months before the onset of the pandemic and you took immediate action with a comprehensive assistance package (the pandemic emergency purchase programme), which is now coming to an end. And just as the pandemic seemed to be losing momentum, the war in Ukraine came along, with consequences that once again mean that your work is not “business as usual”. Have you ever found it difficult in your role?   Crises have often been part of my daily life: in my role as Finance Minister in France, at the time of the financial crisis in 2007-08, and then at the International Monetary Fund, where I worked a lot with European authorities on sovereign debt issues. One of the characteristics of the European project is that Europe is very often strengthened in times of crisis, and the pandemic has again confirmed this. In response to COVID-19, fiscal solidarity on a large scale was demonstrated for the first time in the European Union. As far as the war is concerned, it basically reaffirms the validity of the European project and the relevance of the initial articles of the Treaty on European Union: “The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities (…) The Union’s aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples”.   You will be visiting Slovenia in a few days. It is 15 years since Slovenia adopted the euro: how do you see our country’s economic development and its economic situation?   I am very much looking forward to visiting Slovenia next week and celebrating the 30th anniversary of Banka Slovenije. Half of these 30 years have been as a member of the Eurosystem family, given that Slovenia adopted the euro 15 years ago. Nearly nine out of ten Slovenes are in favour of “a European economic and monetary union with one single currency, the euro”. Of course, rising global uncertainties as a result of the war in Ukraine might weigh on economic activity in the future, including in Slovenia. But I know that in a few days I will encounter a dynamic country with a growth rate that has remained well above the euro area average and exceeded expectations in 2021, a much lower unemployment rate than the euro area average, and a fiscal position which improved markedly in 2021.   Like your home country, France, Slovenia also held elections on 24 April, although these were parliamentary elections. A new government is expected to be formed soon. What would you recommend it and other governments in the euro area do to address inflation and protect the people?  The parliamentary elections have just taken place and the government has not yet been formed. I will therefore refrain from giving any advice in this context. As a general principle, though, targeted fiscal measures focusing on the most vulnerable people have to be preferred at this point in time.   Lastly, Slovenians, like other Europeans and many people around the world, are concerned, on the one hand, that loans will become more expensive and, on the other hand, about what will happen to their savings and standard of living in conditions of increased inflation. What would you say to them as the guardian of the euro?   I would tell them that they can count on the European Central Bank and my very strong commitment to price stability.   "
2022-05-06,Frank Elderson,Q&A on Twitter,"Interview on Twitter with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 6 May 2022","  Interview  Q&A on Twitter   Interview on Twitter with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 6 May 2022 6 May 2022 Hello, this is @FrankElderson, Executive Board member at the ECB. I’m looking forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Join the conversation! #AskECB   #AskECB  Mr Elderson with what is taking place in Eastern Europe and high inflation what is the outlook for the Paris agreement and sustainability in the euro zone will you be able to reach stated goals and targets?    @FrankElderson: Russia’s horrific war in Ukraine has shown how vulnerable Europe is as a result of our dependency on fossil fuels. We all need to do our part to speed up the green transition to reduce these dependencies and protect people from energy price spikes #AskECB   Why is the board's opinion on rates and price stability so far disconnected from the popular opinion? Poll after poll show people disapprove of ECB's actions and think inflation is unacceptable, but not a single board member is sharing those views to represent the people?  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: We hear people’s concerns and take them seriously. Inflation is very high at the moment, which is particularly hard on people with low incomes. We will decide on the next step for the normalisation of our policies in June #AskECB   #AskECB what does the ECB’s executive board think about the causes behind the spike in inflation? Is it possible that inflation is driven by supply bottlenecks in several sectors (commodities, logistics etc) in which the ECB has not control even by tightening monetary conditions?   @FrankElderson: Surging energy prices are the main reason for current high inflation, but supply bottlenecks are also playing a role. While higher interest rates would not solve this, we have to ensure that high inflation does not get entrenched in people’s expectations #AskECB  My colleague Philip R. Lane talked about these aspects and the euro area outlook in more detail yesterday. You can find his speech here https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220505~dcbd30ecb6.en.html   I’d like to  #AskECB  whether they have any clue about the actual change of prices of residential properties (land, houses, apartments) in core European countries over the past several years? What’s the data you’re looking at in that respect?   @FrankElderson: Housing price statistics for the euro area are prepared by Eurostat, and that’s the data we look at. There is quite a bit of variation in house price growth between countries. For a recent release, see here https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220408-1 #AskECB   #AskECB Some of your colleagues have indicated a possible rate hike in July, and one other said June, which month do you expect the ECB to first hike its deposit rate?   @FrankElderson: The exact timing of rate hikes will depend on incoming data. We will discuss this in detail at our next Governing Council meeting on 9 June in Amsterdam #AskECB   Would you consider window guidance towards renewable and nuclear energy? Will you consider increasing rates for housing credits?   @FrankElderson: As a central bank, we set the key interest rates for the euro area. These influence the cost of borrowing and with that, rates for housing loans. The timing for rate hikes depends on incoming data, and we will discuss this in detail in our June meeting #AskECB   Did life get more expensive since the introduction of €?   @FrankElderson: Since the euro was introduced, average inflation has been around 1.7% – much lower than in the decades before the introduction of our single currency #AskECB   Now there is a recession simultaneously to still rising inflation and a monetary policy still far behind the curve. Which reforms of the ECB are necessary in order to act too late and to avoid monetary policy walking into the inflation trap?  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: Weaker incoming data don’t suggest so far that we’re entering a recession and we expect inflation to decline – all depending on how the war evolves and the impact of sanctions. We will decide on the next step for the normalisation of our policies in June #AskECB   Why do we still believe in year 2022 that a central entity can manage such a complex task like price stability, which comprises billions of vectors & variables, with more or less 3 levers? Isn't that like trying to keep the weather stable? And why are central banks so bad at it?   @FrankElderson: Over the last few years, we were faced with severe shocks like the pandemic and now the war. By adjusting borrowing costs we can steer the economy in a way that supports a return to our 2% target over time. This is our unwavering commitment #AskECB   Hello, with such weak activity numbers coming out every day confirming rising odds of a recession in Europe, why would is the   @ECB   discussing interest rate hikes?  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: It is true that the war is weighing significantly on activity, but it also pushes up inflation, mainly through higher energy prices. Our mandate is price stability, so we will make sure that we bring inflation to our target of 2% over the medium term #AskECB   #AskECB Did you follow the Eintracht game last night?   @FrankElderson: All I will say is that today I am neither a hawk, nor a dove. I am an eagle. Congratulations to @Eintracht! #AskECB   #AskECB The ECB is considering hiking rates in the near future. Given how far it is behind the curve would 50 bp increment be more appropriate?   @FrankElderson: Our approach to policy normalisation is completely data-dependent. We will discuss this in detail at our June meeting #AskECB   #AskECB @FrankElderson what's the ECBs position on blockchain and will there be an EU regulatory when it comes to crypto currencies?   @FrankElderson: We need a globally coordinated approach to regulating crypto-assets as they are a global phenomenon. Regulation needs to balance risks and benefits, and address issues like cross-border illicit activities and the environmental footprint of crypto-assets #AskECB  My colleague Fabio Panetta recently spoke about this in detail. Read the full speech here https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220425~6436006db0.en.html?utm_source=ecb_Twitter&utm_campaign=220425_speech_FP #AskECB   My serious questions: Do you think the ECB needs a more transparent mechanism and communication for inflation projections. While many economists warned of accelerating inflation the ECB underestimated it by far for no rational reason.  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: The ECB’s projections have underestimated inflation. This reflected factors that many other expert forecasters did not foresee either, like the unexpected surge in energy prices and more persistent supply bottlenecks that have been aggravated by the war #AskECB  You can read more about this topic in our recent #EconomicBulletin https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2022/html/ecb.ebbox202203_05~6d1fb8f5b0.en.html #AskECB   #AskECB  What is the reason to inflate by 100% your balance sheet since March 2020? Where did the money went?   @FrankElderson: Our balance sheet grew in response to the pandemic emergency. Our policies have kept borrowing costs in check. Together with massive fiscal support, we have helped to protect people, firms and banks from the economic effects of the unprecedented shock #AskECB   #AskECB  why is your rhetoric different for when inflation was below the 2% and when it is above. Is there a bias within the ECB for inflation over 2% than under 2%   @FrankElderson: I beg to differ. We are fully symmetric in our commitment to achieving our price stability mandate. We react just as decisively whether inflation is too low or too high #AskECB   Is Europe and USA, in your opinion, in a similar position as Japan was 30 years ago?   @FrankElderson: No, we don’t see Japanification in the euro area, meaning structurally low growth and low inflation. Our population structure is different, our banks are in better shape, and there is no comparable real estate bubble #AskECB   What is the advantage of CBDS's for the society? It's like the biggest monetary change since banks exist and the media and government media is not even talking about it. Does the EU want to be the new China? No one is talking about the influence of the WEF in the world either...   @FrankElderson: A digital euro would ensure that people continue to have access to the safest form of money: central bank money. At the moment, we are finding out more about people’s needs and would finetune the design features of a digital euro accordingly #AskECB   Will you even consider investments in the CPI? Investments (house prices for example) are in the end just people and raw materials. It might have a delay until it reaches consumer products but eventually it will! Is the division in society today a problem considered by ECB?   @FrankElderson: Owner-occupied housing is both a consumption good and a form of wealth. The costs of housing, whether owned or rented, make up a large part of people’s expenses. This is why we recommend including it in inflation measurement https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2022/html/ecb.ebart202201_01~f643aad55c.en.html #AskECB   #AskECB  Please, an straightforward answer as possible: The m3/GDP ratio has gone up from mid 70% at the beginning of this century to currently way over 100% What would be an about right ratio or range? What has that range historically been?   @FrankElderson: The money/GDP ratio has grown in all major advanced economies, ranging from about 90% in the US to above 200% in Japan. There is no right/wrong ratio; it is a reflection of how much of their wealth people and firms wish to hold in bank deposits #AskECB   #AskECB  why you still keep buying bonds when inflation is above your target? Why are you still printing and making our money lose value?   @FrankElderson: We are planning to end our net asset purchases soon, in the third quarter of this year. They have worked well and helped our inflation outlook to stabilise around 2% in the medium term #AskECB   If Mr. Michael Spence is right saying that most probably globally we are at Lewis Turning Point(growth model has changed, higher inflation will be common phenomenon, world has become multipolar),how will ECB adjust its modelling, mandated goals, role, definition of ""price stability""?   @FrankElderson: Our commitment to price stability is unwavering amid constant changes in the economy due to globalisation, digitalisation and climate change. We covered these changes in our strategy review and are constantly updating and improving our models #AskECB   There´s a increasing of members asking to put at end to the QE this summer and starting lifting rates in the 3Q of 2022, when you think it is appropriate to begin normalizing monetary policy? #AskECB   @FrankElderson: We have already started normalisation. We ended the pandemic purchase programme in March and have started reducing our net asset purchases. Ending net purchases soon will enable us to consider rate hikes this summer #AskECB   Does the   @ECB   assesses that banks can easily absorb the decrease in the negative interest gain they earn on their previously awarded TLTRO III loans, after the additional special interest rate period, thus after June 23?  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: The special interest rate for banks was introduced to support their lending to the economy during the pandemic. We’re confident that this policy support will no longer be needed. We assess that banks can generate profits without taking too many risks #AskECB   #AskECB if  @ECB  introduces an digital Euro, how will you ensure that it doesn't destabilise the heavy reliance on deposit funding by many euro area banks? Thanks   @FrankElderson: No final decisions on this have been made yet. But we will of course make sure that any form of a digital euro would not hamper bank intermediation, because banks play a crucial role in our economy. See more here https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @FrankElderson does he ECB view the current pickup in sovereign bond spreads as a signal to risks to monetary policy transmission are on the rise in the current market environment?  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: We must ensure that monetary policy is transmitted evenly to all parts of the euro area. We are ready to use a wide range of instruments to address fragmentation, including the possible flexibility under the PEPP’s reinvestments #AskECB   So the War in Ukraine is running ECB policy now?   @FrankElderson: No, but it has substantial impact on the euro area economy and on inflation. We have to take this into account when setting policy #AskECB   What, if anything, needs to be done to tackle the environmental impact of bitcoin?  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: Crypto-assets such as #bitcoin have an enormous ecological footprint. Their estimated energy consumption is comparable to that of some countries. Authorities across the world need to see how this affects their sustainable finance roadmaps and take action #AskECB   Good afternoon, what's the role of the ECB when addressing economic challenges that are only in part within it's perimeter of action? Such as supply-driven inflation driven by energy prices.  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: While we cannot lower oil prices, we will make sure that high inflation does not become entrenched in expectations and leads to second-round effects #AskECB  Time to wrap up. Thanks a lot for your questions – I really enjoyed the chat and look forward to doing this again soon. Take care! #AskECB    "
2022-05-05,Fabio Panetta,Interview with La Stampa,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marco Zatterin","  Interview  Interview with La Stampa   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marco Zatterin 5 May 2022    How do you view the economic earthquake from Frankfurt?    The war is dominating economic developments. Global shocks that have emerged on the way out of the pandemic – surging energy prices and supply bottlenecks – have been exacerbated by the invasion of Ukraine. Tensions have become persistent and more acute: inflation is rising while economic activity is showing signs of slowing. This makes the choices facing the European Central Bank more complicated, as a monetary tightening aimed at containing inflation would end up hampering growth that is already weakening.    What is the extent of the crisis?  The European economy is de facto stagnating.  Growth in the first quarter was 0.2%, and would have essentially been zero without what may have partly been one-off spikes in growth in certain countries. The major economies are suffering – GDP growth has slowed in Spain, halted in France and contracted in Italy. In Germany growth momentum is low and has been weakening since the end of February, which is the point when everything changed.    Inflation is rising and GDP is at a standstill. A nasty situation, with divergent threats.  Yes. And we should not lose sight of the fact that inflation is being fuelled by international factors that are reducing purchasing power and weakening consumer demand and investment. Monetary policy has only limited room to affect this imported inflation. The drivers of inflation are global, not European.  Some are suggesting that you should act in order to appreciate the exchange rate.  The exchange rate is determined by the market. Moreover, the shocks we are facing are so large that a few percentage points of appreciation in the exchange rate would have limited impact. Not to mention that a strong euro would weigh on foreign demand, squeezing growth further.  What might be a strategy for action?  First of all, we need to gain a comprehensive understanding. At present, we do not have the hard data necessary to accurately assess the war’s impact on demand and growth. We are talking about potentially large effects: the reduction in euro area income due to increased import prices amounts to 3.5% of GDP, or about €450 billion. The evolution of GDP in the first quarter reflects only partially the impact of the war. We have to wait for the second quarter figures to get a clear picture. Our monetary policy is data driven, and we cannot make decisions before we have seen the figures.  And then?  We must be prudent, recognising what we can do, but also what we cannot do. We can and must prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy, which would lead to price increases that we saw as temporary becoming a structural and permanent phenomenon. We would react decisively, for example, if we observed a deterioration in inflation expectations or wage increases that were inconsistent with our 2% inflation target over the medium term. There is no clear evidence that this is happening, but we cannot ignore the risk that it might.  But what can't you do?  We cannot tame inflation on our own without causing high costs for the economy. We need to act on multiple fronts, not just through monetary policy.  What do you mean?  The international community has a duty to work to stop the war and to end the atrocities taking place in Ukraine. But supporting Ukraine and doing all we can so that the war ends quickly is also the best way to quickly reduce inflation. Peace would ease tensions in international markets (oil, gas and food) that are driving up inflation.  Can you elaborate on what you mean by “supporting Ukraine”?  We all hope that the war will be brought to a swift end through diplomatic means, to stop any more lives from being lost. But if that does not happen, I think we should help the Ukrainians in the way they best see fit, including helping them to defend themselves. And we should support their economy.  In what way?  It’s not just about weapons. There is diplomacy and there is economic support. For instance, there is the issue of food exports: the destruction of infrastructure and freight capacity in Ukraine will have an impact on the world’s supply of wheat and grain. We need to assist Ukrainians with logistics, and help preserve their capacity to export in spite of the Russian maritime blockade and increasing damage to key transport infrastructure. We are already doing this: the EU has suspended all duties on imports from Ukraine and is facilitating the use of EU infrastructure to deliver Ukrainian exports to third countries. But we can do more and achieve important results, for them and for ourselves.  What other action is possible on the inflation front?   We need to strengthen European cooperation. If we want to respond to global tensions, we need a “European shield”. This means coordinating our policies on energy – for example to reduce dependency on Russia – and on food imports. This also means coordinating our fiscal measures to contain the costs of imported inflation. We must implement the agreements made at the Versailles summit in March: in pursuing “open strategic autonomy” we can make value chains safer, diversifying them within the Union. Take for example the opportunities that could be opened by transferring certain production activities to less developed regions of Europe, such as the South of Italy, attracting the capital that is moving away from those countries that are now considered riskier by global investors.  There we go. Back again to southern Italy.  I've been saying this for some time. The pandemic and the war have opened our eyes to the risks, and not just the benefits, of relocating production sites in areas far away from where we are. The South of Italy is safer and more competitive than other parts of the world. Particularly if this relocation can be realised in the context of a European project aimed at stimulating the creation of regional value chains.  So far, so good. But what about the ECB?  With medium-term actual and expected inflation around 2% we can gradually reduce the level of monetary accommodation, providing less stimulus to the economy than in the past. Under current circumstances, negative rates and net asset purchases may no longer be necessary.   The markets are talking about a decision in July.  It does not make much of a difference whether it is two or three months earlier or later. What matters is the signal, the direction of travel. And that is what we have indicated: in the next few weeks we will decide when in the third quarter net bond purchases will end. We will then decide about rates and could decide to bring negative rates to an end. But it would be imprudent to act without having first seen the hard numbers on GDP for the second quarter and to discuss further measures without a full understanding of how the economy could develop over the following months. Discussing how many times we will act in the future, and when, is a futile exercise. Our decisions depend on data: on the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the global economy – especially China and the United States – and on how all these factors will impact on inflation, demand and production. The uncertainty and the risks we face are enormous, and no one can reasonably envisage what will happen between now and the end of the year.  Should we be more afraid of stagflation or of a recession?  We are now in a delicate phase, and we should be concerned about any source of economic imbalance. The task of the central bank is to prevent inflation in the medium term from being inconsistent with the 2% target. There could be an economic cost to pay: we must reduce it to a minimum in order to safeguard employment and growth.  Is there a possibility of using the Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) programme, launched in 2012 for the conditional purchase of government debt in the event of a crisis?  The lesson of the sovereign debt crisis is that in a Union with a single monetary policy and a fragmented fiscal policy at national level, monetary tightening can cause highly undesirable effects if growth is unsatisfactory.  We must prevent monetary adjustment from being accompanied by financial fragmentation. Even more so if fragmentation results from factors like the pandemic or the war that are independent of policies adopted by individual Member States. Faced with financial fragmentation that would impede the transmission of monetary policy, we should intervene decisively. The OMT reflects a different phase with different European policies. The success of our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the Next Generation EU programme clearly show that there are other possibilities that involve flexibility and cooperation, rather than confrontation, between Europe and its Member States.  What should European capitals do?  The events of the last two years call for closer coordination at European level. The energy transition, implementing the Digital Agenda, upgrading our health systems, strengthening our defence capabilities, and the other objectives set by European leaders at the Versailles summit in March imply investment needs for the production of common public goods that exceed the capacity of Member States were they to act alone. In a recent speech, I have shown that the EU as a whole will require a financial commitment of hundreds of billions of euro each year over the next decade. We can only meet these needs by strengthening fiscal capacity at European level.   Meanwhile, Italy is debating a further budgetary correction.   In view of the global challenges we face, Italy must continue to play an active role in Europe and act as a force for greater European cohesion, including at the fiscal level. The speech by Prime Minister Mario Draghi at the European Parliament was an important step in this regard.  As with spending under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza – PNRR), do you think a common fiscal action on energy, the green transition and budgets is necessary?  This is already foreseen – implicitly or explicitly – by the Versailles declaration, including the strengthening of the fiscal capacity at European level. We now need to make progress in that direction.  It’s a nightmare scenario, with a war that drags on, recession, inflation, social unrest. Does it keep you up at night, too?  The doomsday scenarios don't consider the response of economic policies. How things play out in the future is also up to us.  The fact that our experience of the pandemic crisis differed from that of the global financial crisis is emblematic in this regard.  The fiscal policies adopted after the financial crisis  – based on austerity, on the compression of domestic demand – actually contributed to prolonging the economic crisis, after a shock that was initially less severe than the pandemic one. Even monetary policy adopted the necessary expansive stance only with the arrival of Draghi at the ECB.  The reaction to COVID-19 was different. We stimulated domestic demand with wide-ranging European fiscal measures. Monetary policy intervened decisively, guaranteeing favourable financing conditions in all euro area countries and nullifying the deflationary pressures caused by the shock. And it worked: the fall in GDP was deep but short-lived and was followed by a sharp rebound.  This is why it is not useful to discuss end-of-the-world scenarios without taking into account our ability to intervene.   Speaking of unstable things. At a recent conference at  Columbia University  you argued in favour of regulating crypto assets. What are your thoughts?   I made a simple proposal: make crypto assets subject to rules similar to those in other sectors. Why is it that if you win the new year’s lottery you pay taxes and if you sell a crypto asset you don't? And why does a listed company, that produces value and creates jobs, have to follow precise rules for public offerings, while if you sell crypto assets you don't have to explain anything to anyone? The world of crypto assets cannot remain a kind of Wild West without rules: instead, it must be regulated like other sectors in terms of taxation, transparency, public disclosure and so on.  In some cases, more restrictive regulation or taxation would be appropriate. Think of those crypto assets that generate as much pollution as that produced by a country of ten million inhabitants in a year.   Should it be done quickly?  Yes. The value of the crypto asset market exceeds that of the subprime mortgage market that triggered the financial crisis. And it is a world about which we know little. Living with that kind of unknown is not prudent.  The response to this would be the digital euro...  The growth in crypto assets reveals an unmet demand for digital assets and payment immediacy. That demand needs to be met, and if central banks and regulated intermediaries don't do it, others will. That's why the ECB is working on a central bank digital currency. This has nothing to do with crypto assets: The digital euro, as opposed to crypto assets, would be a sound, reliable means of payment in the public interest. Like cash, but in digital form.  By when?  By 2023 we should devise a prototype. After that we will have three years to realise it. The digital euro could be issued in four or five years, if the ECB’s Governing Council and European authorities decide to do so.   "
2022-05-03,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 29 April 2022","  Interview  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 29 April 2022 3 May 2022  Ms Schnabel, the ECB is coming in for a lot of criticism these days and some media outlets are even attacking you personally. How do you handle that?   Above all, that shows that we still need to do better at communicating. People are understandably concerned. Inflation is extremely high, and that hits people on low incomes especially hard. That is why I try to explain our monetary policy also through new channels like Twitter and YouTube. We have an obligation in that respect.   Were you surprised that the topic has unleashed such emotions?   No, I wasn’t surprised. Before the pandemic, inflation had been low for a long time and was thus not an issue for most people. But once a certain threshold is passed, inflation suddenly becomes the subject of intense public debate. And that increases the expectations on us to react.   But what, if anything, can the ECB do? The main price driver is the high cost of energy, which you can’t influence at all.   It’s true that the current high inflation is mainly driven by energy prices. But energy is not the only factor. Initial estimates show that inflation in the euro area stood at 7.5 per cent in April, slightly higher than in the previous month, despite a moderation in energy price inflation. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, climbed strongly to 3.5 per cent. So, we are seeing that inflationary pressures are becoming more broad-based.   The government is trying to partly cushion the effects through subsidies or tax relief. But isn’t that counterproductive? Surely that will ultimately strengthen demand and so push up inflation.   What matters most is to help people on low incomes in a targeted manner so that they can make ends meet. And it’s vital not to create wrong incentives. It makes little sense, for example, to promote energy consumption through price subsidies.   The relatively weak exchange rate of the euro is a factor that could strengthen inflation. How significant is it?   The euro has mainly lost value against the US dollar. Through the higher cost of imports, this has effects on inflation, which we are closely monitoring. But we do not target the exchange rate.   How concerned are you about the emergence of a wage-price spiral? The German metalworkers’ trade union IG Metall is demanding a wage increase of 8.2 per cent for the steel sector. The minimum wage in France is increasing quite significantly.   At present I don’t see such a spiral whereby rising wages create rising prices and vice versa. However, the data are backward-looking and we need to pursue a forward-looking monetary policy. So we can’t afford to wait until a wage-price spiral has already set in before responding.   What wage developments do you expect to see in the future?   There can be no doubt that we will see higher wage demands if inflation remains so high over a prolonged period. We need to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in expectations. Talking is no longer enough, we need to act.   What does that mean exactly?  In March we already discontinued net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). Judging by current data – and it all depends on the data – I believe that we will be able to end net purchases under our regular asset purchase programme, or APP, at the end of June.   That means the ECB would only replace maturing securities after that time. And when will we see the first interest rate hike?   From today’s perspective, a rate increase in July is possible in my view. We of course have to wait and see how the data evolve up to the time of the decision. The first interest rate hike will in any case not take place until after the end of net asset purchases; we have committed to that.   And how many interest rate steps will there be? Many economists expect three this year and four next year, each by a quarter of a percentage point.   We will decide on that from meeting to meeting, on the basis of the incoming data. We are starting from an extremely low level. Real interest rates are still deeply negative and close to their historical lows. That means that even after the first increases, interest rates will remain at levels that continue supporting the economy. We are still quite far off from a neutral interest rate, that is the point as of which the economy is slowed.   The ECB’s key deposit rate now stands at minus 0.5 per cent. What is the level of the neutral interest rate?   This interest rate is not directly observable and can only be estimated. We haven’t yet had a detailed discussion on it in the ECB’s Governing Council. Nonetheless, some estimates show that it is well on the positive side.   In the past, the ECB proceeded very slowly in the case of interest rate steps below zero. Will that also apply to increases, or are steps of 0.25 percentage point more likely?   The lowering of interest rates below zero was uncharted territory, making it essential to move cautiously. This reasoning does not apply when moving in the opposite direction.   Why was the ECB so late in responding to rising inflation?  Inflation proved to be more persistent than was previously expected. But let’s recall that, since September, the macroeconomic environment has repeatedly shifted. Initially, many thought that, with vaccinations, we had largely overcome the pandemic. Then the Omicron variant gave cause for concern. As people realised that this variant was milder, the situation eased again. And then came the terrible war in Ukraine.  What is the mood in the Governing Council now?  The Governing Council is showing great unity overall. Naturally there are differing opinions and you can assume that the full range of meaningful monetary policy arguments are raised and discussed in our meetings. It is to our President Christine Lagarde’s great credit that we again and again find a consensual approach.  Many fear that stagflation is on the way, i.e. that inflation will keep increasing but the eurozone will fall into a recession – caused, for instance, by the war escalating.  The war clearly weighs on economic growth. As things stand today, I’m not expecting a stagflationary outcome; rather, I continue to see positive growth.  But if economic development becomes more difficult, the ECB will face a dilemma. It would then have to decide to either tackle inflation and deepen a possible recession, or to let prices take their course.  Our mandate is clear. We must maintain price stability – that is, keep prices stable over the medium term.  There is another dilemma that is frequently discussed. If the ECB increases interest rates too sharply, it could cause difficulties for countries with high levels of sovereign debt, such as Italy. This is stirring fears that the ECB simply can’t increase rates in the way that would be warranted on monetary policy grounds.  My previous answer also applies here. Our mandate is price stability and this alone determines our policy. Besides, many countries have taken on debts at very low interest rates and at the same time increased average maturities. So a rate hike would only have a gradual effect on countries’ average borrowing costs.  But in the long run a rate hike reaches the national budget.  What matters most of all is economic growth. That is why it is so important that euro area countries use the financial resources provided by the European recovery plan wisely to achieve a sustainable growth path.  But what if a country is subjected to a speculative attack that drives government bond yields unsustainably high?  We will decisively counter any sudden jumps in yields that have no fundamental justification. We will prevent euro area fragmentation driven by speculation. We already have a programme available for this as we can flexibly reinvest maturing securities under the PEPP.  There was also talk about the possibility of a new instrument that would enable targeted assistance for individual euro area countries. What might this look like?  We have shown in the past, for example during the European sovereign debt crisis and the pandemic, that we can create tailor-made instruments very quickly. We will do what is necessary and will design the programmes – and possible conditions for their use – so that they match the respective situation.  In the United States, the Fed has already announced that it is no longer fully replacing maturing securities, so as to shrink its balance sheet. What is the ECB planning to do?  It is premature to discuss this. We will continue reinvesting maturing bonds for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key interest rates. But, in principle, it makes sense to gradually reduce bond portfolios at some point in the future. We know that asset purchases have a strong influence on house prices, which are already elevated. And they influence the term structure of interest rates. A financial system that relies on bank-based financing is better off in an environment in which the spread between short and long-term rates is not too narrow.  Before the pandemic, inflation had been very low for a long time in the euro area and at the global level. Let’s look ahead to a time when hopefully the pandemic and the war are behind us and no new crises have emerged. What will the financial world look like then?  Probably different compared with before the pandemic. Some factors, like digitalisation, could continue to weigh on inflation. But there are other developments, such as the green transition and a possible decline in globalisation, that are likely to increase inflation over the medium term. Moreover, the future high demand for investment in the private and public sectors can be expected to push up interest rates. But if the transition to renewable energy sources succeeds, we will benefit from lower energy prices over the longer term.   "
2022-05-01,Luis de Guindos,Interview with El Correo (Grupo Vocento),"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Adolfo Lorente and Manu Álvarez on 26 April","  Interview  Interview with El Correo (Grupo Vocento)   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Adolfo Lorente and Manu Álvarez on 26 April 1 May 2022  Will interest rates already rise in July?  It will depend on the data and the new macroeconomic projections in June. In April the ECB’s Governing Council decided that asset purchases will end in the third quarter. In my opinion, there’s no reason why this shouldn’t happen in July. Rates will rise after that. Exactly how long after has not been decided. It could be months, weeks or days. July is possible, but that’s not to say it’s likely.  We haven’t even had the first rate hike yet, but the market is already pricing in two rate hikes this year, and there’s even talk of a third. Are you under even more pressure to act?  We are driven by data, not by markets. Markets can sometimes be wrong. Within the Governing Council we haven’t discussed any predetermined path for rate rises.  Some economists are criticising you for acting excessively slowly.  These comments stem from the comparison with the United States, but the situation in Europe is different. There are two main factors that will determine interest rates. On the one hand, you have the evolution of second-round effects – in other words, wage increases that are incompatible with price stability. And on the other hand, you have inflation expectations, which we should monitor to make sure they don’t rise above our target of 2% over the medium term. So far, we haven’t seen wage increases that would put this target at risk, but we have to be very attentive because this is a delayed indicator.  Do you see any risk of a recession, even if just out of the corner of your eye?  The invasion of Ukraine will increase inflationary pressures and reduce economic growth. The fact that the prices of raw materials and energy have increased in the way they have implies, in practice, a tax on workers and companies, because these imported production factors are becoming more expensive. And, ultimately, this implies a decline in living standards. On the risk of recession – in June we will have new projections. What we are already seeing is a significant weakening of growth. Even so, in 2022 growth will be positive. And if we stick to the technical definition of a recession – two consecutive quarters of negative growth – we currently don’t see it.  And one quarter?  Certainly not two.   But in the scenario in which Germany, under pressure from its partners, decides to cut off its supply of Russian gas, the impact on its economy could act as a very significant drag on the entire euro area.  One can always imagine worse scenarios. In the March projections with three scenarios: one baseline, one adverse and one that we call severe, we did not see a recession, not even in the severe scenario. Let´s wait for the June projections.   With the withdrawal of stimulus, are there countries that may experience problems related to funding or their budget deficit?  Nominal rates for public debt have increased all over the world, but risk premia are still relatively stable. The risk of fragmentation has not materialised, but it’s something we are monitoring. We currently don’t see any tensions in this respect, and the situation is in no way comparable to 2011 and 2012.  Is Spain – the fourth largest economy in the euro area – ready to cope with a rate increase?  The Spanish economy has two strengths. First, the financial system is healthy, following the restructuring of the banking sector. This allowed banks to continue lending to firms and households under favourable conditions, even during the pandemic. And second, the Spanish economy is competitive, as the balance of payments of its current account remains in surplus. This has been the case since 2013, even though it was previously inconceivable.    And what are its weaknesses?  Again, there are two. The first is the fiscal situation. The debt-to-GDP ratio is close to 120% and the structural deficit is nearing 5%. In addition, both headline and underlying inflation in Spain are back above the European average. And as Banco de España has warned, corporate margins are starting to be significantly affected, as the profitability of Spanish firms is falling because of the rising costs of energy and commodities. This factor has to be carefully considered.  Would you advise the Spanish Government to start taking seriously the need for increased budgetary stability?  My recommendation – and this is not only for Spain, but for all countries with a weaker fiscal profile – would be to present credible budget plans to Brussels. Plans that set out a prudent and sensible process of fiscal consolidation. With these levels of inflation, interest rates are not going to be as low as they have been in recent years, and governments need to prepare for this. The key, also from the markets’ perspective, is to have credible proposals.  There has been a lot of talk about the Spanish economy’s extreme dependence on the ECB. Beyond the literature, what is the true impact, in figures, of all the measures adopted?  There is one figure that is particularly indicative. During the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, the ECB bought €120 billion of Spanish debt in the secondary market each year. This is equivalent to Spain’s total net issuance. European support, including via the Next Generation EU fund adopted by the European Council, has been crucial, especially for an economy like Spain’s. It was the Spanish economy that suffered the largest decline in 2020 and, despite strong growth of 5.1% in 2021, it was below the European average. And unlike the rest of Europe, income levels have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  Is it sustainable for a government to link pension increases to inflation by law?  Pension indexation is a social policy decision and it is not my place to question it. It’s a respectable decision, but it is also clear that it will have consequences for the sustainability of the system. So, such a decision needs to be accompanied by measures that ensure the system remains sustainable over the medium term.  And what about public sector wages?  I must stress that as Vice-President of the ECB, I cannot enter into the discussion of what a government or party says or does. In general, it’s necessary to be prudent when taking decisions. Sometimes the credibility conveyed by the measures is as important as the measures themselves.  As Banco de España defends, is this the time for wage restraint and for employers and unions to reach wage agreements?  The European and Spanish economies will face a complex situation, with high inflation, a downward trend in growth and smaller company margins. This will have an impact on investment and employment. In such a situation, where difficult decisions will have to be taken, it will be important to have the greatest possible social and political support for economic policy.  And do you think Spain is prepared politically to reach such agreements?  I have made a general remark. I can’t assess the situation of any specific country.  Another issue on the table – not only in Spain – is taxes. Is there any scope for reducing taxes in this crisis environment?  Not all countries are in the same situation. The public sector can play a role in cushioning the impact of the war on businesses and households. But this can also increase the budget deficit.  Some sectors criticise this theory because reducing taxes would further fuel inflationary pressures.  We are talking about temporary and selective measures that should be targeted at the most vulnerable sectors. If the measures are well designed, fiscal policy can help to lessen the impact of an external supply shock like the current one preventing those negative effects for inflation over the medium term. The pandemic affected lots of companies that are now being hit by a second shock. As I said, Spanish companies are seeing significant cuts to their margins.  At a time of uncertainty, the health of the financial sector is key. Do you think there are countries that still need to make an effort to recapitalise their banks?  Broadly speaking and judging by the capital and liquidity levels of European banks, we are in a much better situation than in the past. The pandemic crisis caused a great deal of concern about the potential impact on the financial system, but it has proven to be resilient.  So, you are completely calm when it comes to this matter…  There are still risks. Nominal interest rates are rising in the markets, which enables the banking sector to achieve higher profit margins. But it may also have an impact on non-performing loans. If they increase, bank profitability drops. And for the banks, customer creditworthiness is key.  Looking back, has progress in the Spanish banking sector been good enough? Would you have signed off on the current state of play when you were Minister for the Economy?  In 2011 and 2012 bank risk was a heavy burden that was dragging Spain into a very deep recession. There was a need to request the bank bailout, reform the old savings banks and create [the asset management company] Sareb, as there were more than €110 billion of irrecoverable loans to the real estate sector. In 2017 Banco Popular went into a liquidity crisis, which ended in the bank’s resolution. At that time, despite the size of the entity, there was no longer a contagion effect in the financial sector. So, after years of reforms, the situation in the banking sector was already very different. And today it is one of the strengths of the Spanish economy.  In the case of Banco Popular, would it have been possible to resolve it in just a few hours in 2011?  It would have been completely impossible.  Are the calls for mergers between financial institutions still on the table?  Yes. The European banking sector has a structural problem of low profitability, which it needs to address. Profitability has improved in recent months, but mainly due to the reduction of provisions. Now that we’re in an environment of lower economic growth, there will be a need to analyse whether that trend is sustainable over time or whether other measures are needed.  Do the ECB’s recommendations target domestic or cross-border mergers?  With 19 countries sharing a currency, in a single market and with a single banking supervisor, cross-border mergers would be ideal. Cross-border mergers are not straightforward because there are different regulatory systems and each country has its own unique features. But in a single European system, we should strive to have truly European banks. That being said, domestic mergers also serve their purpose as they can help to reduce excess capacity in some countries, keep costs down and increase bank profitability.  Kutxabank is continuing with its independence strategy.  I can’t comment on individual banks. As is widely known, Kutxabank is an entity with high levels of capital and liquidity which can play an important role in the banking sector in Spain and Europe.

2022-04-21,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow and Alessandra Migliaccio on 20 April 2022","  Interview  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow and Alessandra Migliaccio on 20 April 2022 21 April 2022  Inflation rates are climbing, economic risks are increasing. What is a realistic scenario for the euro area economy at the moment?  Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was recovering. Our prediction was for growth of a little more than 4% this year, and an inflation rate that was clearly on the rise. We had underestimated inflation for a period of time. And now there’s the impact of the war. The consequences for inflation are quite clear. Inflation is accelerating because of energy prices, commodity prices and supply bottlenecks. But simultaneously we’re seeing a reduction in growth through a deterioration of trade. The message is crystal clear in this respect – we’ll see higher inflation and lower growth. That should be reflected in our June outlook.   Will we reach a situation of stagflation?  It depends on the definition of stagflation. If we define it as negative growth year-on-year with very high inflation, then even in the severe scenario, we do not see stagflation.  Will we see a recession in the euro area?  A technical recession – two quarters in a row of negative growth –, is not currently part of our projections. We’ll have an update in June. There is a clear deterioration in the economic environment. But that was included in our severe scenario. The growth rate of the European economy will be very low in the first half of the year. But I don’t believe it will go into negative territory in this first half.  Is the severe case in the ECB’s March projections where the economy is heading?  There is a lot of uncertainty now. You can always imagine worse scenarios, but we have to be realistic. We do not see negative growth year-on-year, but inflation is going to be high for the rest of the year. We believe we are getting closer to the peak. Inflation will start to decline in the second half of the year. But even so, it will be above 4% in the final quarter. We also need to acknowledge that the level of uncertainty is huge. There are a lot of variables that we cannot control, that are exogenous factors that could affect the evolution of the economy for better or for worse.  Will inflation approach the ECB’s 2% medium-term target from above or below?  We will have our projections and different scenarios in June. If you look at survey and market-based inflation expectations, they are around 2% in the medium term. Some slightly above that, some very close to it. What’s clear is that in the medium term, inflation will be much closer to our definition of price stability.  At your meeting last week, some Governing Council members were pushing for an earlier end to net bond-buying. When do you think the asset purchase programme (APP) should end?  We were clear that we are going to end the APP in the third quarter of this year. Whether it happens at the start or the end is essentially fine-tuning monetary policy and in my view it’s not such a determinant factor per se. Having said that, at the moment I see no reason why we should not discontinue our APP programme in July.   If the APP ends in July, is a rate increase possible in July as well?  Theoretically everything is possible. But we need to keep in mind that we have now clearly delinked the end of the APP to the first rate hike, so a rate hike doesn’t need to come automatically once the APP ends. We can have some time in between and we are data-dependent. My opinion is that the programme should end in July and for the first rate hike we will have to see our projections, the different scenarios and, only then, decide. And nothing has been decided so far.   Again, can liftoff happen already in July?  It will depend on the data we see in June. From today’s perspective, July is possible and September, or later, is also possible. We will look at the data and only then decide.  Where do you see rates moving after liftoff?  Our rate-hike cycle will depend on the data. We will act depending on the evolution of inflation. We don’t face any restrictions in that respect.  Inflation expectations and second-round effects are the main factors to look at when setting monetary policy. Two-thirds of the inflation we are suffering now is due to energy prices, so it’s imported inflation. Monetary policy can do very little to deal with this kind of inflation. The main risk is that this type of inflation starts to be more and more persistent and gives rise to second-round effects. We need to monitor this very, very closely.  The longer inflation remains high, the higher the possibility of having wage indexation clauses in the collective bargaining process. We have not seen much in terms of wage increases so far in Europe. But if we start to observe a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and second-round effects, then this is going to be a key element for the future of monetary policy. The Governing Council looks at these data at every meeting.  Is there a clear understanding at the ECB about where the neutral policy rate has settled?  It’s very difficult to gauge unobservable variables. That’s true for potential growth, output gaps and also the natural rate of interest. The natural rate has been declining over the last two decades owing to structural factors such as demographics, globalisation and digitalisation. But the world is now changing. I cannot give you a figure, I don’t believe anyone can. But I think that the natural rate now is clearly on the rise. One of the consequences of this terrible war is that the dividend of peace we’ve benefited from over these years is possibly fading away. Governments may want to spend on other things, like the military and defence. That will change fiscal policy and it is not trivial in terms of potential growth in the medium term.   With the APP about to end, are you concerned about fragmentation in financial markets?  Fragmentation risks aren’t a new concern, and we addressed them when we integrated flexibility into the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). Fragmentation undermines the proper transmission of monetary policy. At the same time, any decision taken to limit fragmentation should not interfere with our monetary policy stance. We conduct monetary policy to maintain price stability. Mixing monetary policy with addressing fragmentation would be a mistake, and the Governing Council is aware of that. We’d like to avoid fragmentation that is not idiosyncratic, that is exogenous. We have some instruments to address this kind of problem. So far, in the Governing Council, we have not discussed any new anti-fragmentation programme in detail.  The main source of potential fragmentation has to do with divergences of countries’ fiscal profiles and potential growth. Monetary policy can do something, but to minimise the potential risk of fragmentation fiscal sustainability in the long term and structural reforms that enhance productivity and competitiveness are needed.  Do you see any problems with the ECB’s preference to end bond-buying before raising rates should asset purchases be needed to address fragmentation in the future?  The nature of the APP is different from the PEPP. That was quite clear from the very beginning. The APP is designed to deliver price stability, not to deal with fragmentation. The PEPP, on the other hand, has a certain flexibility embedded in it. So you have one instrument to adjust the monetary policy stance and another one to respond to exogenous fragmentation. The latter should not interfere with the monetary policy stance. Sequencing is not relevant here.  Energy traders have turned to the ECB for help, and some parts of the market have struggled with the implications of the war. Do you see anything that concerns you in terms of financial stability?  The consequences of the war in terms of financial stability have been much more contained than the situation we had at the beginning of the pandemic. In terms of liquidity, in terms of market tension, it’s not comparable. We have seen some signs of stress in commodity derivatives´ markets, but so far all obligations have been honoured. And in terms of liquidity facilities, our counterparties are banks. We have a very clear framework with respect to central bank liquidity facilities.  Let’s talk about fiscal policy and structural reforms. Is what you’re seeing at the moment enough to deal with Europe’s challenges ahead?  Before the invasion of Ukraine there was a deterioration in public debt ratios in the euro area because of the pandemic, which on average rose by almost 20 percentage points of GDP. But in economics, as in life in general, it’s not only the average that matters and not all countries are in an identical situation. Fiscal policy to address the consequences of the invasion must be different from what we saw during the pandemic. It has a role to play for sure, but it needs to be much more targeted and selective.  Should governments consider funding investments in energy independence or military spending jointly and in a similar fashion to what we’ve seen after the pandemic?  This is a political decision. We are in a change of paradigm. The geopolitical situation has changed and governments are taking decisions in that respect. They will increase military expenditure and try to accelerate the energy transition to reduce dependence on Russia. I have always been in favour of a centralised fiscal capacity. It could make sense now, but it is for the European Council to make a decision about that.  How much of a difference would such a decision make in financial markets when it comes to sovereign yields?  We have not seen fragmentation in financial markets so far. We have seen a little widening of spreads for Italy, Spain or Portugal. But this is not fragmentation like we had in 2010-2012. It’s totally different. And that’s despite the fact that we’re normalising monetary policy. We’ve seen some upward moves mostly at the end of the yield curve, but fragmentation has been contained.   "
2022-04-05,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Antenna TV,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Nikos Rogakos","  Interview  Interview with Antenna TV   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Nikos Rogakos 5 April 2022  What are the main challenges that the Russian invasion of Ukraine creates for the euro area economy? How can we deal with them?   Of course the war is a terrible tragedy. It's a watershed for the relations between the European Union and Russia. There's already been many responses in terms of the war: the sanctions, the help for the many millions of refugees. A lot is going on, including at the ECB. There are really three concerns from the point of view of the economy. One, of course, is: we know energy is a big issue – the price of oil, the price of gas and the supply availability. So that's a big concern. A second issue is trade. Europe has traditionally been exporting many goods to Russia, and Russia is also important for tourism in some parts of Europe. But that is now gone with the sanctions. The third element is uncertainty, and this is the issue we are focusing on a lot. We have seen different indicators of investor confidence and of consumer confidence come down because, in a war situation, people are nervous. They don't know what the future will look like. And if you are uncertain, it makes people more reluctant to spend, to consume, to invest. So this is something that we are keeping a close eye on.  Now, please remember that this year, outside of the war, there is the reopening of the European economy after the pandemic. The war is a major negative economic issue, but the reopening of the economy gives some momentum. So this year, for example, we should expect the tourist season to be better than last year.  Incoming inflation readings across the euro area are very high, and the war exacerbates the situation. When do you think that inflation could peak? How soon should we expect it to start de-escalating? What can the ECB do about this? I remind our viewers that the ECB dealt very effectively with the impact of the pandemic on the economy.  As we've just talked about, behind the inflation is this energy shock. The energy shock is of course very large. In March, for Europe, energy prices were 45% - nearly by half -- higher than they were one year ago. That is a major issue for firms, for households, for governments. In the context of a 45% increase in energy costs, right now inflation is more than we would like. We do think that there may be some months to go. Maybe by mid-year we will see the peak. But I think it depends on the war. Most likely, with the nature of the energy shock, prices will either level off at these high prices or will start to decline. But the momentum of inflation will slow down, so we do think that in the second half to the year, as you say, the inflation rate will come down. And we do think it will be a lot lower next year and the year after. It's very dramatic, but it essentially has an element that we do think will slow down and go into negative momentum.  Would you see a risk of stagflation for the euro area?  Let me emphasise: what we see right now is, when you have this energy shock, it's pushing up prices and it does reduce incomes in the economy. So it's a natural question to ask, but please remember: we have momentum in the European economy because of the reopening after the pandemic. We have Next Generation EU providing public investment in many countries. So when you put all of that together, what we think is – yes – a slowdown in the economy, but the economy will still grow this year. So that is very important, and we think that, unlike the 1970s, these are a few months of high inflation rates. It is not a decade of high inflation rates, and we do think the inflation will fall later this year. So please remember: this inflation is coming from outside, it is not coming from the European economy. This is why we do think it has this special characteristic.  Would you argue that we still need a green transition given the high prices of energy?  I think it's clear, maybe more than ever. We know that the dependence of Europe on Russia is because we have not made the transition. We still have too much oil and gas in our energy mix, so we know it cannot happen overnight but we do have to increase the share of renewables: solar panels, wind energy and so on. This is the only answer. Now, of course the plan has to be credible, the plan has to be financed, so it's a big challenge for this decade. It is not overnight, but I think the answer is clear: it is to accelerate the transition.  How do you see the war affecting the Greek economy? How would you describe the general situation of the Greek economy?  Well, I think the war is essentially going to affect all of Europe, including Greece. As we talked about, here firms and families will have to cope with high energy prices. Yes, the Government can and should respond to protect the most vulnerable, but it should be on a targeted basis and temporary. These high prices, the economy will have to adjust. It's correct to offer temporary and targeted help but there is a limit to that. So the energy shock is there. For trade, I think the exposure of Greece is maybe more limited than some other European economies. For uncertainty, there's both the direct effect here and the indirect effect because if investors in other parts of Europe cancel some plans, maybe they will buy fewer imports from Greece. So I think Greece is part of the mainstream in the situation. It's a general European concern; it is not specific to Greece.  I know that this question should be addressed to your colleagues in ECB Banking Supervision, but since we have you here – could you tell us a bit more about the prospects of the Greek banks?  We all recognise that there has been progress, for example in reducing the amount of non-performing loans, but after a major crisis I think there needs to be a lot of persistence. to make sure that these are addressed. Even if they have been sold in many cases and are no longer in the banking system, they do need to be resolved. So the faster all of the mortgages that need to be restructured and other loans find a final resolution, find a final settlement, this will allow the financial system to focus on new lending and supporting the Greek economy. I would say dealing with the legacy remains an issue. Dealing with now what we see now, where firms that have energy exposures, will have to be reviewed by their banks. So I think, as always, if the banking system is going to provide important support for the economy, focusing on good procedures, good financing, remains very important.   "
2022-04-01,Philip R. Lane,Interview with CNBC Europe,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach","  Interview  Interview with CNBC Europe   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach 1 April 2022  Many people, consumers and investors alike, are watching the inflation numbers very closely, 7.5% is much higher than many had expected and is causing some concern, what is your reaction to today’s print?  Of course, this is a very high number. Behind the overall inflation rate is a 45% increase in energy inflation between this year and a year ago, and that's a very large – yet another large – step increase from the 32% we had last month.  So clearly here we are at the 1st of April and the war in Ukraine has added further upward pressure, as you just said to energy prices, to commodity prices. So, this asks the European economy to absorb a 45% increase in energy prices, which in turn is off the scale. And it's pushing up costs across the economy. All of the different sectors behind the overall number are seeing an increase in prices. This has many, many consequences. So as you said in the introduction, households will be suffering in terms of their purchasing power. Firms face very large energy bills, especially in the most intensive energy sectors. Governments are also, of course, responding in many ways to this energy shock. So, what we have to do as the ECB, is to analyse the consequences of these very high inflation numbers, which operate through a number of channels. Of course, through inflation dynamics – with these high numbers, there would be more momentum behind inflation through second-round effects and so on. But we also have to look at the implications for the supply capacity of the European economy – many firms will struggle with these high energy prices – and for demand. And then maybe the data point to note here is: the war has had many consequences for Europe, and we've also seen in recent weeks a big dip in some sentiment indicators. So, in our upcoming meetings we will be putting together the first order impact of these very high energy numbers, but also the implications for confidence for real incomes and supply. So it's of course a very major development for us.  You have been referring already to second round effects, especially the wage developments. Are you seeing signs that this is picking up faster than you previously expected, which could also mean a change in your assessment?  What I think we are seeing is it takes time for the wage response to the price increases. So I think early this year we are seeing some signs, but very mild, of wage responses to what's happened so far. But of course, for those who were negotiating wages in maybe in January and in February, that is before these high inflation rates have picked up yet again. What I would say is that in terms of what's being concluded so far, it remains the case that we see wages are only responding in a very limited way, but of course we have to take into account. And by the way, in our projections we do assume that wages will grow more quickly over the course of this year and into next year. I suppose really what I'm saying in that is that this is of course on its own terms something that will raise the cost of living, that will reduce our purchasing power and will be surely a factor in wage negotiations to come. On the other hand, the ability of firms to pay higher wages will have to take into account the fact that firms face higher costs also. And then we have the wider demand environment, where the loss of real income from paying these high energy prices will reduce demand. And on top of that, we have the war situation, where the uncertainty of the war also creates uncertainty and demand conditions. So, it's a situation where many things are going on. I would summarise it as a situation of uncertainty. And of course this is why in our March decision we emphasised optionality and flexibility in monetary policy. Because we have to realise under these situations that the correct monetary policy response will depend upon how the data arrive in the coming weeks and months.  So, commentators are suggesting that you are facing a policy dilemma right now because clearly growth estimates are getting downgraded really fast, how much of a headache is that for your policy projections?  With this type of supply shock essentially, and the uncertainty shock, you do have that difficult situation. But in the end, this is why, when we – especially in our quarterly meetings – have a comprehensive assessment and new forecasts, essentially this has to be brought together, informing our medium term inflation outlook.  And what we concluded at the March meeting is, essentially if the medium-term inflation outlook remains in a situation where we think inflation will not be falling below our target in the medium term and over the next couple of years – as you know our forecast for 2024 was a little bit below the targetat 1.9 – in terms of our sequence the first decision will be – if the medium term inflation outlook is maintained – that we will be looking to end net purchases in the third quarter. However, if the outlook deteriorates by so much that the inflation outlook weakens, then we will have to think again. And what we have here is opposing forces: on the one hand, we have the energy shock and the prospect of second round effects are pushing up inflation; on the other hand, as you say, the weakening of sentiment and the fact that real incomes will suffer with the high energy prices – and especially so over a one to two year horizon – will have a negative pressure on the inflation outlook.  This will be why it's going to be a lot of work, a lot of analysis, a lot of debate about the net impact of those opposing forces. So today, you know this is again highlighting the impact of the war, highlighting really levels of inflation we have not seen. So we have to properly assess this, to take it side by side with the news about sentiment. But by the way, yet another complication is we also have the reopening of the European economy, there is still momentum compared to last year in terms of the normalisation of economic activity. I think it's important that we take our time, and use the forecasting exercises to bring all of that together and form a net assessment in our upcoming meetings.  Given the pushes and pulls that you just described, could we end up in a situation where, if inflation became so problematic for businesses and households, where the economy needs more monetary support rather than less in the months ahead?  Remember what we have now is: we have policies that that were introduced when we had inflation far below target. And what essentially we've been talking all year long is about the appropriate pace of normalisation. I think it ultimately remains the case that we now have inflation right now well above target, and these considerations you mentioned about possible hits to demand, possible slowdowns of the economy, to me it's really about the appropriate pace of normalisation. It's not a set of situations where I think additional monetary support compared to where we've been is really, I think, going to be part of the answer. But that reflects the fact that we're coming from a situation of having policies that were introduced to fight excessively low inflation, and that normalisation coming back towards neutral is a very different concept from a kind of situation of tightening.  As you know, the yield curve has been moving all year long, so there's already been tightening going on in terms of financing conditions in a nominal sense, and we will have to assess – when we come to the upcoming forecasts – the net impact of the fact that we do have monetary tightening due to the upward movement in the yield curve. We do have this inflation pressure right now and then we have all the uncertainties of the war. So yes, it’s not so easy, no obvious answers here. But this is what we will be working on for the coming weeks.   "
2022-03-29,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Politico,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck and Suzanne Lynch on 28 March","  Interview  Interview with Politico   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck and Suzanne Lynch on 28 March 29 March 2022  What are your views on the inflationary outlook? It is obviously an issue that is affecting citizens, people all over the European, eurozone economy. Where do you read things at the moment?  If you go back to last summer, we would have had the view that inflation was still essentially subdued, and that we were basically in a campaign to bring inflation gradually to the 2 per cent target. And remember, we published our strategy review last July, and so on. Then, what we’ve seen in the last number of months is the energy shock, which is by far the dominant factor and which is now further amplified by the war. This is quite sudden. People were not expecting this, governments were not expecting this, households and firms were not expecting this. For that reason, right now, clearly inflation is a huge issue across Europe, absolutely. And how to respond to this, the implications for fiscal policy, the implications for wage negotiations, the implications for demand and so on – this is a very important issue right now. But this relates to a second issue, which – for us and for everyone – is how long will this episode be? This is where we would still diagnose that this essentially is an imported inflation shock, it’s a supply shock. And for these reasons we would still maintain – by the way, I don’t think it’s unique to the ECB, it’s the general economics profession – that most of this inflation will fade away. Fading away from inflation doesn’t mean that these high prices will reverse. Europe may have to get used to higher prices. But the momentum – where every month you wake up and you read that inflation is higher than the previous month – that element, the momentum element, we do think will decline. We do think that inflation will decline later this year and will be a lot lower next year and the year after compared to this year.  This is the kind of nuanced issue. The current episode is extremely serious, requires a lot of change in behaviour, but at the same time – going back to the very popular analogy of the 1970s – we don’t see this as a kind of locked-in phase where every year inflation will be high. We do think, because it’s imported inflation, that essentially the momentum will level off.  You mentioned it’s not an ECB-specific phenomenon, but there have been other attitudes or actions taken by other central banks. How do you explain the ECB’s strategy on this?  It essentially boils down to the diagnosis that the balance between imported inflation and domestically driven inflation is different here. Remember, compared to the United States, first of all, Europe is a major energy importer. The United States is an energy producer as well as an energy user. So, for the United States, high oil prices will benefit some parts of the US economy, because of the oil producers. Whereas for Europe, because more than 90 per cent of energy is imported, it’s essentially collectively bad news for Europe. So, number one is that the energy shock is more significant for Europe. And number two is that we don’t have the same domestic demand conditions. For example, the scale of the fiscal policy injection last year was much bigger in the United States than in Europe, and so the ingredients for domestic inflation are simply weaker in the euro area than they are in the United States.  To what extent do you share the view that the projections are already obsolete, both on growth and inflation, as some of your colleagues have suggested?  There are mixed signals coming through. The higher energy price is definitely above the baseline, that’s for sure. We also have quite significant and substantial drops in sentiment indices, both for consumers and for firms, which of course is a major concern. But so far we are not seeing the kind of very non-linear disruption in the supply of energy. We’re not seeing a scenario so far where not only is the price of energy fairly high, but the supply also becomes unavailable to Europe, which would be much more of an interruption to economic activity. This permeates our assessment. We also see a reopening of the European economy after the latest coronavirus (COVID-19) wave. So, if I put all that together, it basically says that some indices are showing upside concern for energy prices and other indices are showing downside concern for activity levels through the sentiment channel. Rather than making an assessment on a day-by-day basis, we’ll be closely monitoring the balance of these factors.   How would that balance have to change for you to continue asset purchases beyond the third quarter?  It revolves around the medium-term inflation, since that’s the key orientation for monetary policy. Let me decompose that. We have two forces. One is high current inflation, which runs the risk of creating its own momentum through second-round effects. On the other hand, if we see a significant downward revision in demand, that on its own terms will imply a downward revision for medium-term inflation. So, it’s essentially about quantifying the relative strength of those forces.  Given that current forecasts are already close to your 2 per cent target, would a limited shift in the outlook prompt a quicker exit?  What we said is that it is basically too early to know what the correct calibration of asset purchases is for the third quarter. In March we had an inflation outlook which was getting close to 2 per cent. If that outlook is maintained, we will be looking to end net purchases in the third quarter. If it weakens, or if financing conditions deteriorate, that would be inconsistent with delivering that action. Then we would have to think again. So if we see a significant decline in the medium-term inflation outlook, that will be the trigger for revising the net purchase schedule.  Your guidance also says that you will lift interest rates sometime after the end of purchases. Could that “sometime” be sometime this year?  I don’t know. We are trying to be as clear as we can that monetary policy will be data-driven. So there are scenarios where it would be appropriate to start to normalise interest rates later this year. And then, of course, there are scenarios where it could be appropriate to move at a later point. This is why this phrase “sometime after” was deliberately introduced. It’s supposed to explain and emphasise that the timing of interest rate moves will be in line with the incoming data. The end of the third quarter is six months from now. There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the outlook given the war and the pandemic reopening. By the way, the latest COVID-19 issues in China show that the pandemic continues to add to uncertainty. Under these conditions, trying to give calendar guidance is not helpful. The commitment is that our monetary policy responses will ensure that, in the medium term, inflation will stabilise at 2 per cent.  Your severe scenario, which includes a complete disruption of oil and gas supplies from Russia, still sees 2.3 per cent growth for this year and next. That is very different from what the Government in Berlin is saying. It warns that a complete ban would throw Europe into a recession. How do you explain this huge discrepancy in the assessment?  First of all, let’s be clear that these were two scenarios, but these were explicitly not intended to be tail scenarios. So worse scenarios can be envisaged. Our scenarios assume that the interruption of energy supplies is just temporary. These assume that later this year Europe will essentially have found alternative sources of supply. If you impose a longer period of interruption of energy supplies, then you would have a more significant drop in GDP. So that’s where people can make different calls about how long the interruption in supply might be. It is also important to remember that the European economy is recovering from the pandemic-induced recession. So you need to overlay the effects of the war, which is a substantial adverse hit under all scenarios on the European economy, on the fact that, at the very least, the European economy is normalising from the pandemic. For example, the summer tourist season should be a lot stronger than last year. At the same time, some of the supply chain issues that were there last year are easing. For example, towards the end of last year the car industry recovered to some extent from having been severely hit by the semiconductor shortage. Now there are new supply chain issues, but it is important to recognise that both the easing of some of the bottlenecks and the basics of allowing the services industry, travel, tourism and entertainment to normalise do give momentum to the European economy. Regardless of emergency scenarios, it still means GDP is going to be a lot weaker than without the war. It’s a bad news situation. It’s a downgrade to the recovery under all scenarios, whether it turns out to be such a strong downgrade that our economy shrinks for a while is not the only way to think about it. Even if the economy continues to grow, it’s still a very negative event.    So if Europe failed to replace Russian energy imports by year end in case of a boycott, you see the risk of a recession?   I think the analysis would say that the longer you see a situation where there is a more prolonged set of supply chain issues, that would create risks for next year. So again, that’s something that the ECB will be continuing to look at. But, in the end, all of this falls back to essentially our overall framework, which is saying, look, we’re in a world of extreme uncertainty. We tried to give some references to deal with the uncertainty by publishing several scenarios. But we also tried to be clear that these scenarios don’t cover every possibility. These focus on, essentially, a temporary hit to the economy rather than a long-lasting hit. I think that should be crystal clear. So these are not predictions. These are scenarios. The most important issue from our point of view is that we’ve laid out a monetary policy framework with flexibility and optionality, which is expressly designed to be capable of responding to whatever unfolds in terms of the medium-term outlook.   Picking up on your points about the impact of the war. We’d like to get your views on how that’s going to manifest itself. Is it potentially the impact on energy, or is it supply chain issues, or food exports, etc? Where do you see the danger zones for the European economy from the war that is now happening in Ukraine?  Let me divide the issue. There are mechanical channels, where the important factors are energy, some supply chains, food… that’s for sure. But to recall, energy is a global market. Even if the overall global supply of oil and gas is more limited, there are options for Europe to find alternative suppliers eventually. The world will have to deal with less supply, so collectively the world faces an issue, but also for Europe there will be options there eventually. So then the bigger issue is if this is a trigger for a big decline in sentiment. All economies operate on confidence, and what we see now in terms of these first readings of confidence indicators is a concern. But essentially this goes back to the course of the war, diplomatic possibilities and so on. There are two possibilities: either this initial confidence shock will become embedded and people will settle into a long period of being hesitant, or, if the war finds a diplomatic solution sooner rather than later, those confidence indices could maybe recover. So this is why essentially, right now, uncertainty dominates. I can conceive of each of those paths. One is that we get more clarity about the possible diplomatic solutions to the war and these confidence indicators recover, or we settle into a prolonged period where, essentially, people are reluctant to make significant decisions given the uncertainty. And so if you have a pausing of investment plans, of recruitments plans, pausing of consumption, then clearly that is a pretty general way to slow down the European economy, even if quantitatively the direct exposures to the Russian economy and Ukraine are limited enough.  There doesn’t seem to be any sign of that at the moment – pausing of investment plans, recruitment, consumption.  The timeline is that these sentiment indices are leading indicators. We don’t see the investment decisions on a day-by-day basis. These sentiment indicators have proven in the past to be a leading indicator of what might happen next. But again, let me come back to the basic point: there’s an overlay here of all of that, side by side with the pandemic recovery, which I do think is ongoing. There will be a reopening of travel and tourism once the latest wave of COVID calms down, and people will be more willing to go out to restaurants, cinemas and so on. So it’s difficult not to overstate the basic point here: Europe was not in a normal economic situation when this war began. It was in a situation where – and remember this winter we had a further holding back of the European economy with a new wave of COVID – sooner rather than later this artificial holding back of the services sector in Europe will come to an end, and that should lead to a significant rebound in activity. This is why it’s not a normal war situation  – it’s side by side with a normalisation process in the economy, which we think will continue.   On energy – you commented a couple of times that there are other options for Europe to find alternative sources in the event of a curbing of Russian imports – by the end of the year – that sounds quite optimistic. There are a lot of infrastructural and other issues that have to be overcome. Do you think that it is realistic?  I’m not saying there’s a perfect replacement, but compared with the immediate shock, over time alternative sources of oil and gas can be found. I’m not saying that to make the lack of Russian supply irrelevant, but there is an adjustment mechanism. So I do think, again, this will have spillovers to other parts of the world, as of course Europeans have to pay high prices for energy. But high prices for oil and gas will have spillover effects on other parts of the world which are also energy importers. Just think about Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia and so on, which will probably suffer more from higher prices.  Given that your severe scenario assumes that there will be a replacement by the end of the year, you must think that that is a realistic scenario, right?   To a degree. There is a lot of effort to find alternatives. Part of the adjustment will also be a change of behaviour. Over time, households will find ways to try to reduce their energy usage in particular. So there will be behavioural changes which will also help to reduce the initial impact of the energy shock. But what I’m saying is simply that we’re just at the end of the first quarter here in late March, we’re talking about nine months until the end of the year. To say that there wouldn’t be some success or some effort to find some alternatives in the course of this year would not be plausible… I think there are going to be a lot of efforts to find alternatives. I’m not saying that it totally eliminates the impact, but when you have a possible supply disruption, the biggest impact will be at the start, when you have not had time to find alternatives. And every month as Europe races to find alternatives, that worse impact at the start becomes weaker. And that’s just simply the straightforward adjustment. When you have a surprise interruption to supply, the maximum impact will be at the start and then, over time, the effort will be there to find alternatives.   Just coming back to something at the beginning – this energy shock, that it was quite sudden and governments weren’t expecting this. But last September or October at the Eurogroup you had countries like Spain warning – pre-Ukraine war – of spiralling prices. Were the ECB or policymakers too slow to recognise the threat of rising energy prices?   Essentially there’s a two-phase issue here. Definitely, at the bottom of the pandemic shock – I think the price of oil was USD 25 in May 2020 – prices were extremely low. Then a recovery took place in the first half of 2021, which could simply be seen just as a demand recovery. Then there was a new phase in the second half of the year, and by the autumn the price of oil was around USD 80. But what’s happened is that now it’s USD 120. So we’ve had this extra phase. There was already a lot of debate about how we handle USD 80. Pre-pandemic – between 2014 and 2019 – the price of oil was fluctuating, but basically between USD 40 and USD 70 a barrel. So you’ve had different levels of intensity. There was already a pretty big debate in the autumn about the implications of USD 80 a barrel. Adding 50% more to reach USD 120 was pretty significant. Another element which was new was gas. Gas, as you know, has an unusual pricing structure. You had a really large increase, so that remains a significant issue. If there was some entity out there that was calling that this was going to be an outcome with a high probability, we missed it, but by and large it is something the world collectively missed. We can always reflect on whether we can do better.  Just to clarify, when you were talking, for example, about USD 80 in November, that was 2021.  Yes. Our analysis would be that in the first half of the year, rising oil prices could simply be seen as the recovery of the world economy. In the second half of 2021 what seems to be happening is that supply was not keeping up. There seems to be supply issues with oil, you know OPEC+ and now with Russia. But then there are supply issues with gas as well. So essentially there are a range of factors at work. When it became a supply side issue in the autumn, there was concern around that. The normal relationship between economic activity and energy prices was thrown off by the fact that basically interruptions to supply were becoming more important.   One thing I wanted to ask was your views, or where you see the debate, on the fiscal side: reform of the Stability and Growth Pact rules – are they fit for purpose anymore? What’s your view on that?   Personally, back at the end of November/early December I spoke at a European Commission seminar. But what I said is more or less similar to the ECB statement on this. There is an identified reform proposal which focuses on having an expenditure rule as the most important component. Essentially, what that means is that governments should line up their fiscal plans with their medium-term economic prospects. The expenditure rule has that feature.  Second, we would also agree that you still need a debt anchor. Those countries with high debt do need to see these debt ratios come down. But I would argue that essentially interest rates should be a lot lower than the historical norm when the Maastricht Treaty was written. The coefficient there – there is currently the one-twentieth rule – in my intervention back in December I suggested a 0.3 per cent coefficient. It’s still a significant coefficient but a lot milder than 0.5.  The third element I would emphasise is that the pandemic has shown the value of common European funding, whether that’s SURE or Next Generation EU. I do think that we face very significant common challenges. Climate, in particular, but you can also think about other dimensions of that. In response to common shocks, having common forms of finance, either of the SURE dimension or Next Generation EU, should be part of the broader fiscal recipe for Europe.  The Stability and Growth Pact is about national fiscal policies, but it’s really a two-dimensional debate – how to run safe national policies. And the point I’m making here is that all of these shocks – the pandemic, the war – underline the value of fiscal buffers, of having some spare capacity. And this is why keeping an eye on debt ratios is important, but then also the balance between national and European level issuance is important.   Do you think that the war in Ukraine and the energy issues that has thrown up has strengthened the case for these kinds of common forms of finance?   Definitely. It underlines or reinforces one of the big topics of the next decade, which is the carbon transition. This relates not only to the basics of the Paris Agreement, but – specifically in the European context – also to the interconnection between energy and security and autonomy. For Europe, unlike the United States, for example, more than 90 per cent of our energy is imported. Doing more to increase renewables, for example, has had an additional dimension: it reinforces the case for having a vigorous transition plan. And since it’s a common agenda – the climate is shared – to me, the case for European-level initiatives should be closely studied.  Do you think the war will pave the way for more permanent joint bond issuance?   I don’t find that way of thinking about it to be the best way of thinking about it, because it’s not a case of whether an initiative is temporary or permanent. It’s essentially the question: at a point in time, is Europe using the best device to respond to the challenge it faces? In the case of the pandemic, I do think Next Generation EU was fundamental to the European recovery from the pandemic. Then of course, many people say: is the pandemic the only type of development that would justify common funding? We’ve talked here about two factors. One is climate being a common challenge, where common types of funding could be important. And of course the war itself could lead to related fiscal challenges across countries. But let me emphasise: we have two models of European issuance during the pandemic. Both have a role to play. One is SURE, which is basically on-lending to national governments, so there isn’t the kind of sharing of liabilities. There’s a clear limit to that type of lending programme, but there is still a lot of value to that versus the more joint nature of the Next Generation EU initiative. It’s not about permanence, it's about diagnosing the best answer to the challenge you face.  Perhaps a very big picture question towards the end. There’s been a lot of debate about what this event means for the global economy, and the pandemic and the war spelling the end of globalisation. Is that a view that you would subscribe to?   I think there are several levels to that. It’s a little bit reductive to boil it down to that phrase, “the end of globalisation”. There is a significant issue about Russia in particular, how the Russian economy will interact with the rest of the world economy. That’s very specific and it’s significant for certain commodities in particular. After that, of course, there are maybe two other forces at work. One is the resilience of supply chains. The resilience of supply chains could involve making supply chains more local, but it could also involve just making sure that multiple suppliers are available, which does not necessarily have a geographic component. Because you could have multiple suppliers around the world, but you’re less exposed to any one choke point – if you like – if you have that. On that side, a lot of what we think about globalisation could be retained. And then, of course related to strategic autonomy, for key sectors which overlap with security, there is a question about having autonomy at European level.   You didn’t mention China, which is interesting.   China is a big part of the world economy. Again, all of that has implications. Those are significant issues. Let me point out a trend that is a little more in the opposite direction, which is digitalisation. Digitalisation essentially does mean that there’s a force to bring economies closer together, because essentially you no longer need to travel to interact with suppliers from another jurisdiction. If you think about the services industry – and of course we already know that within Europe there is a lot more cross-border activity – digitalisation is a force pushing in the opposite direction to anti-globalisation. It should make it more possible to sell services around the world, to buy services around the world. Connected to that is automation. The debate about globalisation should be paired with technological developments, because it goes back to what’s really driving the world economy: the possibilities created by IT developments, including automation, a greater role for robots, a greater role for services trade. I do think it’s important to put globalisation side by side with a general digitalisation dynamic.   "
2022-03-26,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Phileleftheros,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Theano Theiopoulou and published on 27 March 2022","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Phileleftheros   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Theano Theiopoulou and published on 27 March 2022 26 March 2022  Do you think the European response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is strong enough?   Let me first express my deep sorrow for the ongoing loss of so many lives as a result of the Russian war against Ukraine. The decisions by EU governments clearly demonstrate their determination to respond to this horrible act of aggression and their solidarity with the people of Ukraine. It is crucial that sanctions are effectively implemented, and the ECB is doing its part. While we don’t have a mandate to assess and enforce banks’ adherence to the different sanction regimes, we are working with the relevant European and national authorities to ensure that banks have clarity on how to apply the sanctions.   While we were about to leave the pandemic behind us, we are now faced with a new crisis because of the war. How much can it harm or delay the economic recovery that was under way globally and what is the risk of having a recession in the euro area if the war drags on?  The war is expected to have a considerable impact on the global economy, and especially on the European economy due to Europe’s proximity to Russia and dependence on Russian gas and oil. It will likely lower euro area growth and push up inflation in the short term through higher energy and commodity prices, confidence effects and the disruption of international trade. Of course, the overall impact will very much depend on how long the war lasts.  Our baseline projections, which include an early assessment of the impact of the war, don’t foresee a recession, given the euro area’s strong labour market and the fading pandemic. The projections see the economy growing at 3.7% this year and 2.8% in 2023. However, given the significant uncertainty, ECB staff have prepared two alternative scenarios: an adverse and a severe one. In the severe scenario, growth could be as low as 2.3% in 2022. But there’s a lot of uncertainty around these estimates.   Is there a risk of stagflation though? Could the euro area economy stagnate?   So far, incoming data don’t point to a material risk of stagflation. The euro area is back to its pre-crisis level of output, growth continues and the labour market remains strong. In the short term, the surge in inflation is due to factors related to the pandemic, stoked more recently by disruptions to global energy prices related to the war.   Prior to the invasion of Ukraine, there were increasing calls in many Member States to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy to tame inflation. Do you think developments in Ukraine will mean a postponement of such decisions or do higher rates remain possible in 2022?   As you know, our decisions and the path of policy normalisation are entirely data-dependent. Our forward guidance is very clear about the conditions that we need to see before we would consider raising interest rates.  In current conditions, more than ever, we need optionality in our monetary policy. That is clearly reflected in our latest policy decisions in March. We revised the path for net asset purchases and will reduce them step-by-step in the second quarter of this year. We indicated that if the incoming data support the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook won’t weaken even after the end of net asset purchases, we will conclude net asset purchases in the third quarter. If, on the other hand, the outlook changes and financing conditions deteriorate in a way inconsistent with our two per cent inflation target, we stand ready to revise our schedule for net asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration.  We remain very attentive to the prevailing uncertainties. The calibration of our policies will remain data-dependent and reflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. We will take whatever action is needed to fulfil our mandate to pursue price stability and safeguard financial stability.   How real is the risk that the ECB's worst-case scenario of 7.1% inflation in 2022 will materialise?   This is not the baseline scenario in the ECB’s staff projections. It is also important to stress that, in all our scenarios, inflation is expected to decrease and settle at levels around our two per cent target in 2024.  Was it possible for the ECB to foresee the huge problem of very high energy prices even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine?   Higher energy prices are mostly a result of geopolitical tensions, and you can’t easily foresee the impact of such tensions. We try to cater for the high uncertainty stemming from the current situation, which is why our latest projections were accompanied by the more negative scenarios. Energy prices were also affected by unusual weather conditions, which were also not possible to forecast.  Is it possible to reduce the EU’s dependence on Russian gas, oil and other raw materials in the next few years?   Many European governments are working hard to reduce their dependence on Russian energy, but this takes time. Russia accounts for 22% of euro area energy imports. These can’t be replaced overnight. The euro area is also highly dependent on other Russian raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt and vanadium. Economic dependence on hostile actors is indeed a vulnerability.   Cyprus is heavily dependent on Russian tourism and Russian business. How severe do you think the impact of the war on the Cypriot economy will be?   The war will affect the Cypriot economy through a number of channels. Arrivals from Russia and Ukraine represented as much as 25% of the total, so initiatives by the authorities to substitute and diversify the sources of tourism are the right approach. Also, given the importance of Cyprus as a hub for foreign direct investment to and from Russia, professional services such as accounting, consulting and legal services are also expected to be affected. Finally, the Cypriot economy will be affected by the inflationary pressures from higher energy costs owing to its dependence on oil imports for power generation. You know very well, however, that every challenge can also be an opportunity. Cyprus is the easternmost and southernmost member of the EU. It offers a European institutional framework, the security of the euro as its currency, and can serve as the hub for business in the Middle East and North Africa region. Your country has demonstrated time and again that it is agile, and that it can cope with difficulties and emerge stronger.  After the 2013 crisis the Cypriot banking system greatly reduced deposits of Russian funds and exposure to the Russian market. How do you assess the way it is handling the turbulence caused by the war? Has the impact of sanctions on banks been more significant in other euro area countries?   The direct exposures of the Cypriot banking sector to the Russian economy are overall rather limited and they continue to decrease. The lost profitability from card transactions or wire transfer fees related to Russian clients is also limited. Indirect effects through tourism are sizeable but can be mitigated by efforts to diversify tourism sources.  Let me also note that important progress has been made over the past few years in stabilising the banking system, improving solvency and liquidity positions and reducing the stock of legacy assets. The Cypriot banking system is better prepared today to withstand the current crisis. The last time I was in your beautiful country, ten years ago, things were looking extremely difficult. But Cyprus is in a totally different position today, having effectively tackled many of the problems it had in the past.  On Thursday RCB Bank announced that it is winding down its business and refunding all deposits. Your comment on that?   This was a business decision and I won’t comment on individual institutions as per our standard policy at the ECB. What is important is that all deposits will be redeemed. In a sense, this decision lifts some of the uncertainty and should enhance confidence in the Cypriot banking sector in the medium term.    "
2022-03-20,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Frank Wiebe and Jan Mallien on 14 March","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Frank Wiebe and Jan Mallien on 14 March 20 March 2022  Mr de Guindos, how big is the danger that the war in Ukraine will cause problems in the European financial system?   Some risks, such as the high financial market valuations and public and private indebtedness, were present even before the current crisis. But the situation today is not comparable to the one we had two years ago when the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic broke out. There are no liquidity bottlenecks. Firms can still issue bonds, for example. Stock markets are indeed fluctuating but for the moment we are not seeing any dramatic developments.   But haven’t there been problems in the commodities markets?   Margin calls on commodities derivatives have been triggered, in other words, there have been demands for further collateral to cover open positions. But according to our observations, those facing these margin calls have so far been able to meet them.   What do you see as the greatest danger for the financial system?   The macro risk, that is to say the possible consequences for the overall economy; higher inflation and slower growth are the greatest risks, for the banks too. That macro risk plays a far more important role than problems in individual market segments.   Are we now heading towards stagflation, a situation in which economic growth is weak and inflation is high?   I wouldn’t say so. Before the outbreak of the war we had assumed a growth rate of 4% for this year and a little bit less for next year respectively. In the most recent projections, even in our most adverse scenario for the current year, we still foresee growth of more than 2%, so no stagflation. Inflation, however, is likely to remain higher for a longer period than expected before the war.   The euro has been weak recently. What role does that play?   We do not target a particular exchange rate. We are of course aware that a weaker euro exchange rate will make certain imports more expensive. On the other hand, the currency movement is most visible against the US dollar, which is still in demand as a safe-haven currency. If we focus on the basket of currencies of our trading partners, we see that the euro has remained quite stable.   There is even some speculation that the ECB might intervene in the foreign exchange market.   We aren’t intervening in the foreign exchange market because we don’t target any exchange rate.   Inflation has recently increased considerably. Is the ECB still actually able to keep prices under control?   What matters for us now is the extent to which wages respond. Because if wage increases are too high, they can push prices up even more and contribute to persistently higher inflation. We have not seen any signs of that yet, but we need to monitor developments closely. The same goes for inflation expectations. On the basis of survey information and market data, expectations for the next three to five years are anchored close to our inflation target of 2%. But we need to keep a close watch on that.   The ECB last week held out the prospect of a more rapid end to its bond purchases. What does that mean for potential interest rate hikes?   The most important decision taken during our meeting was to delink the potential interest rate hikes from the asset purchase programme; interest rates will not need to be increased automatically after the end of net asset purchases. In this way we are keeping all our options open to respond flexibly to the data.   Does that mean the first interest rate rise will only come later?   It all depends on the data. We are monitoring developments in inflation very closely. We will be extremely vigilant concerning second-round effects and we will be attentive to any developments that could indicate a wage-price spiral, where both factors become mutually reinforcing. Fiscal policy should also play a role here.  What exactly do you mean?   The price shock in energy and commodities that we’re currently experiencing is making many firms and workers worse off. Fiscal policy should provide temporary, targeted support to help reduce the burden. This would also reduce the danger of a wage-price spiral.   Do last week’s decisions actually amount to a tightening of monetary policy?  I would say it’s a normalisation.  According to the ECB’s projections, inflation should fall back to 2% again in 2024. Why would that happen so fast?   At the moment making projections is particularly difficult. One reason for the drop in inflation could be that the significant increase in energy prices cannot last for too long. Prices can stabilise at a high level, but no longer increase at the current high rate.   The ECB repeatedly overestimated inflation in the past, whereas more recently it’s been underestimating inflation. Is there a problem with the models underlying the projections?  Over the past year we have underestimated inflation, as other institutions and economists have too. Forecasting is particularly challenging in periods of high uncertainty. Past trends play an important role in the models. Models have a tendency that projected inflation levels revert to the historical mean.  But what will the ECB do if it continues to underestimate inflation?  Our decisions are based on the data. If we continue to underestimate inflation, we will respond. All options are on the table. Second round effects and a potential de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations will be the deciding factors. If we see those, then we will act.   In Germany there’s great concern that the ECB can’t steer hard away from inflation because of the high indebtedness of countries like Italy and Spain.  Our monetary policy is wholly determined by our price stability mandate. Our monetary policy decisions and the available instruments are geared to meeting our inflation target.  A fragmentation of the euro area, with for instance major divergence in interest rates in the bond markets, could undermine the effect of monetary policy. However, the risk premia on these countries’ government bonds are about the same now as they were before the pandemic. They remain clearly below the highs seen around 2011 and 2014. In addition, nominal yields are still very low overall.  Nonetheless, in the past weaknesses in the construction of the euro area have emerged again and again. Are the ECB’s instruments adequate to keep these risk premia in check if they start increasing once more?  We have the possibility to counteract that in a targeted way through reinvesting in a flexible way the purchases to replace maturing bonds under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). But we have to make a clear distinction between this flexibility and our general monetary policy objective. Our task is price stability.  Isn’t keeping the euro area together a task for fiscal policy?  There’s no doubt that fiscal policy has an important job to do. It needs to tackle, in a targeted way, the hardships resulting from the current crisis. A targeted and temporary approach is also important to prevent the amounts of support involved from driving government debt substantially higher.  Where should that be done, at the national or the European level?  Initially at the national level, but a coordination framework should be agreed at European level.    "
2022-02-23,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gerald Braunberger and Christian Siedenbiedel on 21 February ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gerald Braunberger and Christian Siedenbiedel on 21 February  23 February 2022  Mr Lane, is monetary policy normalisation in the euro area edging closer?   In times of great volatility and uncertainty we should not make absolute statements. But the data clearly suggest that we could be moving closer to our medium-term target.   Has your assessment of the appropriate monetary policy stance changed with recent developments in the Ukraine crisis?  We will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the economic outlook at our March meeting. This includes the recent developments on the geopolitical front. These not only have implications for oil and gas prices, but also for investor confidence, consumer confidence, trade and so on. So in terms of inflation there is not just the mechanical effect from commodity prices, for the medium-term outlook the macroeconomic effects need to be incorporated. As we already flagged at the February meeting, the geopolitical tensions are a very important risk factor right now, for Europe in particular.   So the March meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council could be exciting. What will happen next with the bond purchases and the key policy rates?   It’s important not to anticipate the decision that the ECB’s Governing Council will take in March. A lot can happen before then and, as mentioned, there is much uncertainty in the world. But our strategy is crystal clear: we want inflation to stabilise around two per cent in the medium term. There are three possible ways of getting there. First, if the medium-term inflation outlook falls well below our target, the ECB must pursue accommodative, i.e. loose, monetary policy. Second, if medium-term inflation settles above our target, we would need to tighten monetary policy. Third, if inflation settles around our target in the medium term, then a normalisation of monetary policy, as we call it, would suffice.  What do you see of that right now?  Inflation rates are high at the moment, hitting 5.1 per cent in January. We expect them to decline in the course of this year, but at what pace and by how much is uncertain. The decisive factor for monetary policy is how inflation develops in the medium term. If inflation rates are moving towards our target in the medium term, which is now looking more likely – instead of being well below two per cent as before the pandemic – we will adjust monetary policy, because we would then, for example, no longer need to make asset purchases to stabilise inflation at our target over the medium term. It was different in December, when surveys still showed the expectation that we would need to maintain asset purchases until the middle of next year, but the timeline may be shorter than what people expected then.   Some critics think that the ECB will not dare to end its asset purchases if that would push up the cost of some countries’ sovereign debt and threaten a fragmentation of the bond markets, almost like what happened during the sovereign debt crisis…   Our monetary policy is driven solely by our mandate. If inflation moves close to our target, we will phase out quantitative easing. It’s true that we created a lot of flexibility during the pandemic with our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). We are also convinced that we need to ensure the transmission of monetary policy works so that our interest rate policy is not undone by fragmentation of the European bond market and the resulting strong divergence in the financing conditions across member countries. In December we said that we will be flexible in our policy when needed. And we also pointed to a particular application of the flexibility: even when the net asset purchases under the PEPP come to an end, we can reinvest the portfolio flexibly. That can help with any fragmentation risk that might arise. But the situation is in any case completely different to that in the financial crisis 13 years ago. The world today is rightly not expecting to see interest rates to return to the levels we saw 15 years ago. Should interest rates move up from a very low level to a slightly higher one, the consequences would not be comparable to what we saw then.   Government spreads have indeed widened slightly in recent months. Up to what point will the ECB accept that?  We make a comprehensive assessment, especially at the quarterly meetings, such as in March. The overall economic situation is that a strong recovery of the European economy is expected. Interest rates have gone up from very low levels but remain low compared to historical averages. Of course, the financing conditions play a role for the recovery. And we will always be vigilant, we care about fragmentation risks.  So where do you see upside risks for inflation?   Following our February meeting we said that, compared with the December meeting, we saw more upside risks. Many of these related mainly to the short-term outlook: energy prices continued to increase and the bottlenecks in supply chains could last longer than expected. But these are not lasting phenomena, they belong to the temporary components of inflation.   But aren’t you worried that almost everyone – central bankers, journalists, economists (with the possible exception of US economist Larry Summers) – has underestimated the degree and persistence of inflation?   Inflation rates are indeed higher than expected, and these will persist for longer than originally thought. That mainly reflects energy prices and the supply bottlenecks, but the longer the origin of the shock remains, the more this affects a wider set of prices. So we are also revising our assessment of the persistence of inflation in this respect. But our instruments take 9, 12 or 18 months to affect the economy; that’s why we emphasise the medium-term nature of monetary policy. Many of the factors that are now driving inflation rates up will play less of a role in 12 or 18 months. The economy is not in an overheating zone. We think that most of this inflation will fade away.   ECB Executive Board Member Isabel Schnabel has also pointed to upside risks for inflation resulting from climate policies. Do you expect “greenflation” to exert extra pressure on prices?   The impact on inflation will of course depend on how the green transition proceeds and this will be a gradual process. A lot also depends on what the countries do with carbon tax revenues. A recycling of tax revenues can boost the economy. At present, however, energy prices are being driven up mainly by global factors, and less by, say, national carbon taxation in Germany.  Investors have been putting less capital into oil companies because they are sceptical about the future of fossil fuels. Does that contribute to the high oil prices?   The huge spike in oil and gas prices is not being driven by the carbon transition. The oil price has essentially been going through a sort of “pandemic cycle”. In the first year of the pandemic, 2020, energy prices fell unusually low. And in the second half of 2021, they recovered strongly. There have been all sorts of supply issues, but these will eventually be resolved. As a central bank, we don’t have to take a stance on exactly where these prices are going. But we need to be agile and responsive to what happens.  If this is all to do with a pandemic cycle, do you think we will go back to the way things were before the crisis – with very low real interest rates, very low economic growth, very low inflation and low productivity growth? Or has the pandemic changed the longer-term inflation trends too?  I don’t think we‘ll go back to the 2019 situation in the coming years. But it is not entirely clear what net impact the changes will have. For example, digitalisation received a boost during the pandemic. This should be an anti-inflationary force as it reduces costs. Business travel being replaced by cheaper video calls is one example of digitalisation. On the other hand, companies that struggled with supply chain problems may become more cautious, potentially focusing on their resilience, their reliability, rather than costs. This could push up prices. In addition, the demographic developments are predictably going to continue, as the population becomes older. There is also the question of whether the internationalisation of the European workforce is coming back. A smaller workforce may translate into higher wages, but also less demand in the economy, so the net impact on inflation is unclear.  Do you really expect trade unions not to try to compensate for the current high inflation rates? Or is it more realistic to expect a wage-price spiral at some point?  We do expect wages to pick up. The question is how much. When we target an inflation rate of two per cent and expect productivity to grow by one per cent, wages in the euro area increasing by an average of three per cent would be consistent with our inflation target. We are monitoring the wage situation very closely. There may be an element of catch-up, but this is not the 1970s – central banks have learnt their lessons. If there was a threat of a wage-price spiral, we would act. And the wage bargaining partners know this, too.  In Germany, many people still believe in the quantity theory: over the years, the ECB has printed so much money that it created inflation, and since it continues to print more money, inflation will continue to grow. Why is this theory wrong?  That is a theory of domestically generated inflation. What we have now, however, is a lot of imported inflation. That theory would also suggest that people have too much money in their bank accounts, leading to a big surge in consumption and investment, which drives prices up. We are not seeing that. It is important to recognise which prices are growing. The most remarkable increases relate to the prices of gas and electricity. Food and other products that need energy as an input are becoming more expensive. But, unlike in the United States, in Europe we are not seeing a general demand boom, just certain catch-up effects related to the pandemic. What we are seeing at the moment is mostly imported inflation, through the prices of oil and gas. The pandemic led to very high demand for liquidity and the ECB had two options: either meet that demand and allow a big expansion in liquidity in the system or have a large increase in capital market interest rates, which would have added a financial problem on top of the pandemic problem.  How is the inflation situation in the United States different to that in Europe?  Both in the United States and in Europe global factors such as the increasing price of oil have a major impact on inflation. However, in the United States domestic factors such as high demand resulting from fiscal measures play a greater role. The stimulus package introduced by President Joe Biden was much bigger than the fiscal stimulus in Europe, with a bigger impact also on the labour market. The inflation rates are correspondingly higher there. This is why we cannot compare the situation of the Federal Reserve to that of the ECB at the moment.  The Fed has already announced its rate hike plans. How could the ECB go about it?  We were crystal clear in our monetary policy strategy, which we published in July. We have a sequencing: our net assets purchases will first be scaled down, then ended. Then, the key policy rates will only increase above their current levels if the conditions consistent with our medium-term inflation target are met. So before we talk about potential rate decisions, we need to end net asset purchases. And we need to prepare the market for the eventual end of these purchases.  How do you personally experience the high inflation rates in your daily life?   Like everyone, we notice that the energy bill has gone up, petrol has become more expensive, the prices for many groceries have increased. But we are of course aware that people with lower incomes are much more affected by the higher prices, and that they also feel the impact of the energy shock very differently.   "
2022-02-15,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 14 February and published on 15 February","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 14 February and published on 15 February 15 February 2022  What has changed since your December meeting that has made the ECB so much more concerned about inflation?  Last year, we were expecting that the sharp rise in inflation that we've seen in response to the reopening of the economy would subside relatively quickly because base effects were expected to drop out and bottlenecks were expected to be gradually resolved. What we've learnt over time is that high inflation is now expected to stay there longer. We've had two strong inflation surprises in both December and in January, which makes a reassessment of the inflation outlook necessary. In particular, it now looks increasingly unlikely that inflation is going to drop below 2 per cent by the end of this year, as we had expected earlier. A reassessment of the inflation outlook has also become necessary in the light of three fundamental changes to the macroeconomic outlook. One is that the current Omicron wave is now expected to be more short-lived and less severe than previously thought. The second point is the strong data on the labour market. Labour market slack has been absorbed much more quickly than previously expected. We are seeing a historically low unemployment rate and a historically high participation rate, and surveys are pointing to strong future employment growth. Also, more and more firms are saying that a lack of labour is a factor limiting production. All this could imply that wage pressures are going to be stronger than we originally expected. This would be consistent with our survey among firms where a majority now believe that even though wage growth in the past was relatively moderate, it's going to pick up going forward. And finally, there is quite a bit of pipeline pressure. We've seen continued strong growth in producer prices. Part of that is only going to be passed through with a lag. And it seems that the pass-through can be expected to be stronger than usually.   All of this implies that it has become increasingly likely that inflation is going to stabilise around our 2 per cent target over the medium term. This means that we should start thinking about a gradual normalisation of our policy. In this there are two types of risk: There's the risk of acting too early and there's the risk of acting too late. We have to find the right balance between the two. With the most recent data, however, the risk of acting too late has increased and therefore we need a careful reassessment of the inflation outlook.   Given that oil prices are about 10 per cent higher than your last forecast in December, does that make it almost inevitable that the ECB will raise its inflation forecasts for 2023 and 2024 to at least 2 per cent in its next forecasts in March?   I think we really have to wait for the outcome of those projections. Rising oil prices have different effects. They tend to have a dampening effect on demand, even though fiscal policy is doing quite a bit, especially to protect the more vulnerable parts of society from the rise in energy prices. And then we have the direct and indirect effects of oil prices on inflation. So we really have to see what comes out of the projections, and I would not want to pre-empt that.   But the high level of inflation is mostly being driven by rising energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks and some people say monetary policy can do little to address either of those issues. So shouldn't the ECB look through these exceptional pressures from the supply chain and energy markets?  I've already pointed to the strong developments in the labour market. Labour market slack has been absorbed faster than anticipated and, as a result, wages may rise more quickly going forward. So there's a demand component in what we have seen and that's precisely what we have to look at. We also have to ensure that current high inflation does not become entrenched in expectations because that could then give rise to a wage-price spiral. We are not seeing anything of that yet. But we have to analyse this in a forward-looking manner and make sure that a wage-price spiral does not arise. Because once it's there, it's relatively costly to fight. So I think we cannot simply look through everything, especially if inflation now becomes more broad-based and more persistent than we originally thought.  If in future a conflict in Ukraine was to push up energy prices even further, would the ECB look through this in its monetary policy decision-making, or could it accelerate a shift to a less accommodative policy?  Geopolitical developments are part of our assessment. We are monitoring the situation closely. We would consider not only the impact on energy prices but also the broader repercussions on global and domestic growth and financing conditions. Given the likely negative effects of an escalation of the crisis on growth and confidence, including through potential sanctions, it is in my view unlikely that we would accelerate policy normalisation in such circumstances.  Markets are now pricing in several rate hikes by the ECB this year and a return of your deposit rate to zero by the end of the year. Are investors getting ahead of themselves?   Already before the February meeting, lift-off was expected around the summer of the year. That has to be seen in the light of the changes to the inflation outlook and the strong labour market. One should not take the market pricing of lift-off dates literally because it also contains risk premia, reflecting the high uncertainty that we are currently facing. So the actual expected lift-off date that we can take from the data is likely to be somewhat later. But as I said, and as President Lagarde also stressed in the press conference, we are acting in a data-dependent manner. We have a very clear forward guidance, which has defined conditions for lift-off, and I think markets are very well aware of that. Now we have to assess the incoming data and see whether these data fulfil the conditions. Let me also remind you that we have confirmed the sequencing of our different monetary policy measures. The forward guidance refers to interest rates and we said that net asset purchases are going to end before we are going to raise our key policy rates. So when we are discussing and reassessing the pace of our asset purchases, we have to be forward-looking and ask ourselves when we expect the conditions of our forward guidance to be fulfilled.   As well as a sell off in bond markets in the eurozone, we've seen an increase in peripheral bond spreads recently. How concerned are you about that trend? And do you think the flexibility of your reinvestments will be enough to counter any fragmentation in markets?   We've seen a general repricing in bond markets, which is not surprising given the change in our communication and the fact that the repricing started from very low interest rate levels. A particular challenge of the euro area is that a repricing of the risk-free rate may be accompanied by a change in sovereign spreads, which may then affect the transmission of our monetary policy to different parts of the euro area. We are aware that, given the euro area’s incomplete institutional architecture, parts of the single currency area remain vulnerable to a sudden shift in investor sentiment. Spreads generally reflect differences in fundamentals. But they can become destabilising when there is a lot of uncertainty or when there are self-fulfilling expectations. We therefore carefully monitor the developments of yields and spreads in the euro area, and we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation. In the pandemic, flexibility in our asset purchases has played an important role. We have seen that that was a powerful instrument to counter the impaired transmission of our monetary policy. In our December decision, we confirmed the importance of flexibility and we said that in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) can be adjusted flexibly and we consider this very important.   So are you concerned about the trend of widening spreads? Can you be a bit more specific on that?   Spreads have increased, but from very low levels and they remain well below the levels that we saw in the years before the pandemic. Governments will continue to benefit from the low interest rates that we've now had over a long period of time and also from the marked increase in the maturity of public debt. Therefore, even if current bond yields adjust upwards, average interest rates on the countries’ debt will stay low for an extended period of time. What also matters is that the euro area is expected to grow strongly in the coming years. Looking forward, it's absolutely key that governments invest and carry out structural policies that can lift potential growth. NextGenerationEU certainly plays a very important supporting role here. In a growing economy, rising yields are not a major concern.   When do you think the ECB net asset purchases are likely to stop?   All our monetary policy measures are guided by the inflation outlook. In March, we are going to look at the data that have come in as well as the new projections and then the Governing Council is going to evaluate the progress we have made in meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. And when we judge that the probability of meeting the conditions is sufficiently high, we will consider adjustments to the pace of our asset purchases, reflecting our sequencing. This implies that we will end our net asset purchases before the conditions of our forward guidance are fulfilled.   You have talked previously and warned on several occasions about the negative side effects of asset purchases. Do you think that they should be used only in exceptional circumstances? And are you not a fan of asset purchases?   I would not put it that way. I very much agree with our conclusions from the monetary policy strategy review that asset purchases are a standard tool in certain circumstances, in particular when monetary policy is constrained by the effective lower bound. Asset purchases are then an essential instrument to ensure price stability. However, we have to be mindful that asset purchases do have side effects and that these side effects are likely to increase the longer asset purchases remain in place. We're always very carefully assessing the proportionality of our measures. We look at the balance of benefits and costs and I would say that we are getting to a point where in light of the inflation outlook, the benefits of further net asset purchases may not justify the additional costs. Then there is an argument for ending net asset purchases. This decision is linked to the inflation outlook. That is important. So you cannot look at the side-effects in isolation.   If the Governing Council does decide that it's likely to meet the conditions for raising interest rates, will the ECB also change the calendar for reinvesting the asset portfolio that it has built up? Is the reinvestment period likely to be shortened?   In December, we already announced that we expect to end reinvestment under PEPP at the end of 2024. So far, we have not made any specific statement about the duration of the reinvestment under the asset purchase programme. In the current situation, we first have to focus our decisions on net asset purchases and the question of lift-off. The discussion regarding the size of our balance sheet after policy lift-off will be held in the future.  What about another tool that you've been using since the pandemic hit, which is the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, lending to banks at a subsidised rate of minus one percent if they meet certain lending criteria? That generous rate looks likely to stop in June. But when will it be time for these operations to stop altogether?  We have already announced that we expect the special interest rate period to end in June of this year. The special rate was indeed an extraordinary measure that was linked to the pandemic and it looks as if it is no longer needed. We are monitoring bank funding conditions, and we also have to carefully look at whether the maturing of our TLTROs will not hamper the smooth transmission of our monetary policy. I think the TLTROs have been a quite successful tool, they have helped reduce bank lending rates to very favourable levels, and they have contributed to preserving bank lending over the pandemic. But also for this tool, we now have to transition into the time after the pandemic. At this point in time, we don't have to take any additional decisions because the current round of TLTROs is still running until the middle of next year. The main decision that we have to take now is the question of the special interest rate period and there our current announcement is that this is very likely to end.  Some of your colleagues on the Governing Council have argued that the ECB should consider the effect of rising owner-occupied housing costs on the inflation figures and believe this takes you closer to achieving your targets in the medium term. What do you think about that argument?   In our monetary policy strategy review, we came to the conclusion that we need to take the costs of owner-occupied housing into account. Currently, the data is not sufficient, so there is a long process that has now been initiated in order to get a measure that is going to include owner-occupied housing at the proper frequency and also at the proper quality. But we have some preliminary data that we can look at and, in fact, the recent increase in housing prices has been unprecedented. If this were included, it would have a substantial effect on measured inflation, in particular on core inflation, where the weight of owner-occupied housing is larger. For example, in the third quarter of last year, core inflation would have been 0.6 percentage points higher, which is substantial. We cannot ignore this. It has to be part of our general considerations. One outcome of the strategy review was that for the time being our main inflation measure remains the harmonised index of consumer prices. When it comes to asking whether the conditions of our forward guidance are fulfilled, the President has always made clear that this is in the end not mechanically linked to the projections, but is a judgement by the Governing Council. And here, housing prices should enter in.  Do you have a sense of whether inflation is higher for low income households than it is for higher income households, or whether it's the same for all households?   Given that inflation is very high in the energy component and is also high for food, low income households who typically spend more on these types of goods are going to be affected more strongly. It is concerning that current high inflation is particularly painful for those households in the lower income category. But there is very little we can do about current high inflation. Even if we hiked rates now, this would not bring down today's energy prices. This is why we look at medium-term inflation. And there, we have to find the right balance between acting too early, meaning that we could choke the recovery, or acting too late, which could lead to high inflation becoming entrenched, which would also have a substantial cost. And we know that a recession, which can happen in both cases – whether you act too early or too late –, would again be likely to hit those the hardest who have the lowest income to begin with, because these are typically the people who are most affected by an increase in unemployment.   Some ECB watchers noticed that Outright Monetary Transactions wasn't mentioned among the tools listed in the conclusions of your strategy review. Has OMT been retired due to lack of use or is it still a tool available to you in the toolbox?   OMT remains an instrument in our toolkit. The motivation behind OMT that the Governing Council had at the time is still valid: the need to counter fragmentation on the one hand and to have conditionality on the other hand in order to minimise risks related to moral hazard and to protect monetary dominance. Yet, one may ask the question whether the eligibility criteria of OMT are the right ones in all circumstances. We know that there has been reluctance to resort to an ESM programme due to the stigma effect. At the same time, we are seeing that with NextGenerationEU, one can have conditionality without strong stigma effects. I think this is a discussion that we may want to have at some point.   The ECB has spent much of the last decade trying to get inflation up to its target. The last time the ECB raised rates was in 2011, which was shortly before the eurozone sovereign debt crisis started. Do you think that that makes the ECB more cautious about raising rates this time and more worried about returning to that environment of ultra ultra low inflation?  One has to be a bit careful in comparing the two situations. Before the pandemic, the euro area was in a quite different situation, and the experience from that time was reflected in our monetary policy strategy review. This is also when we developed our forward guidance, which now protects us from acting too early. But at the same time, once inflation expectations are de-anchored, it can be very costly to re-anchor them. That is also shown by historical experience. This is precisely the reason why it is better to respond in a timely but gradual fashion, rather than being forced to act abruptly at some point in time, which could also have adverse effects on financial stability. If you have a very abrupt policy change, investors are not able to adjust their portfolios in a gradual fashion. I really think it's important that we find the proper balance here.  The ECB last year added a financial stability assessment into its monetary policy considerations, which is a change from how it worked previously. How do you think financial stability risks will feature in the current discussion?  There was an agreement that financial stability is a prerequisite for price stability. And while macroprudential policies are the first line of defence, they are not yet perfectly effective. This is why we decided to also consider financial stability considerations in our monetary policy decisions. Such additional considerations, like financial stability or inequality, enter into a monetary policy decision when it comes to assessing the side effects of our measures − that is in our proportionality analysis, where we are trying to see whether the benefits of our measures are higher than the costs and whether one tool may be preferable to another one. And financial stability certainly plays a role there.   "
2022-02-11,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by Andreas Niesmann and Tim Szent-Ivany","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by Andreas Niesmann and Tim Szent-Ivany 11 February 2022  Madame Lagarde, do you still do your own grocery shopping?   Answer: Of course I buy my own groceries. And I also pay my own gas and electricity bills.   So you know the feeling of everything becoming more expensive.  I certainly do. I see that prices are going up and I am by no means indifferent to it. There are members of my family whose business is hampered by the rise in energy prices. That concerns me very much.   You are the guardian of the euro. Why don’t you do something about it?   You are right in saying that the ECB is the custodian of the euro. Our task is to maintain price stability. If that is in danger, we will take action. But we have to ask ourselves when is the right time to do so. We have to consider that the full impact of any decision we make is generally not felt until nine to 18 months later.   So shouldn’t you take action all the sooner? Inflation in the euro area is at a record high…  Hold on! We first need to understand the source of the rise in prices. Just over 50 per cent of it can be attributed to the surge in energy prices. Oil, gas and electricity have become more expensive. And as we import a lot of energy, these prices are, to some extent, beyond the sphere of influence of our economy. The second main factor driving up prices is supply bottlenecks: shortages of microchips, container jams, disrupted supply chains. Let me ask you: what can the ECB do about that? Can we resolve supply bottlenecks? Can we transport containers, lower oil prices or pacify geostrategic conflicts? No, we can’t do any of that.   You could fight inflation by raising interest rates.   That would not solve any of the current problems. On the contrary: if we acted too hastily now, the recovery of our economies could be considerably weaker and jobs would be jeopardised. That wouldn’t help anybody.   So your attitude is still wait and see?   No, we have already begun to take measures. In March we will discontinue the pandemic emergency purchase programme. The ECB will reduce the overall volume of its net asset purchases. Ending net asset purchases is a precondition for increasing interest rates at a later point in time.   When do we reach that point in time?  We currently see inflation figures increasing and we are taking that into account in our projections. Inflation may turn out to be higher than we projected in December. We will analyse that in March and then take it from there.   Why did the ECB fail to foresee the problem of high energy prices?   We were not the only ones. Just under two years ago there was so much oil that tankers were lined up in the ports. And buyers were actually given money if they purchased oil. This collapse in demand was unprecedented – as were, shortly afterwards, the recovery in demand and the geopolitical upheavals, which have driven up prices. In truth, neither of these movements could have been rationally anticipated.   How can we be sure that you have got it right this time with your forecast that inflation will be a passing phenomenon?   Please don’t get me wrong: high energy prices are not a temporary phenomenon; they will be with us for some time to come. But the price level is already very high. The oil price has gone up from less than €20 in April 2020 to €90 per barrel and it is highly unlikely that it will continue climbing at that pace. So even if only for that reason, inflation will slow down.  With respect, inflation in January stood at 4.9 per cent compared with the same month of the previous year. At 5.3 per cent, it was only a little higher in December – particularly when you consider that the temporary reduction in VAT is no longer distorting the statistics.  Inflation will stay relatively high in the coming months. However, I am confident that it will fall back in the course of the year.   Does that mean there is no need to act?   We need to carefully analyse how the high energy prices are affecting other prices. Expensive energy pushes up the price of fertiliser, expensive fertilisers push up the price of food, and so on. We will scrutinise that closely in March, and in every subsequent meeting in the coming months. We will act if necessary. But all of our moves will need to be gradual.   As recently as December, you deemed an interest rate increase this year to be “very unlikely”. Have you now struck out the word “very”?   We have not yet reached the goal of durably stabilising inflation at our target of two per cent over the medium term. But we are making progress and getting closer to it. That would allow us to gradually withdraw some of our interventions. But that can only be done step by step. I would compare it to preparing to take a turn when driving a car. Nobody does that at full speed in fifth gear; you take your foot off the accelerator and shift down the gears in stages. That’s exactly what we’re doing now. As soon as the pace is right and the situation allows it, we will turn the wheel.   Other central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England, have taken the turn – i.e. put up interest rates − long ago, or have announced that they would do so. Why are you so hesitant to act?  The situation in the United States or the United Kingdom cannot be compared to the euro area. The US economy is overheated, whereas our economy is far from being that. That’s why we can – and must – proceed more cautiously. We don’t want to choke off the recovery.    On the back of your monetary policy, the markets have rushed from one record high to another. At the same time, people who wanted to save for their retirement through life insurance policies have lost tens of thousands. Why are the sensitivities of investors more important to you than those of small savers?  I’ve been ECB President for two years now, and within three months of me taking office the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic broke out – with a huge impact on the economy. Amid this enormous crisis we made money available so that families and firms could continue to access loans. This meant that thousands of insolvencies were avoided and millions of jobs were saved. We gave crutches to the economy so that it could continue on its path. We will soon remove the crutches, because firms can once again operate unaided.    Was there no alternative to the policy of low interest rates?  We already had negative interest rates when the coronavirus crisis hit. Raising interest rates would have driven the economy straight into the wall. We would have ended up with a financial crisis on top of the pandemic and the economic crisis. But we managed to avoid that. Now we can adjust – calmly, step by step – our monetary policy instruments. And when the economic data allow it, we will do it.  Everyone is talking about “greenflation” – the fear that the shift towards renewable energy is fuelling inflation. Are you also worried?  No. The current impact of decarbonisation on prices is minimal – be it from emissions trading or carbon taxes. We must complete the green transition of the economy to prevent the Earth from turning into a frying pan.   Those who are warning about greenflation do not just mean carbon prices, but also the prices of the resources that are needed for the green transformation: silicon, nickel, copper and others.  The impact that the prices of these specific resources have on general price developments is small, at least at the moment. I think that the greenflation debate is exaggerated.  What do you make of the threat of second-round effects, meaning higher collective wage settlements as a result of the price increases? The head of the chemical trade union IG BCE, Michael Vassiliadis, has said that protecting his members from inflation is the main goal of the next round of wage negotiations.  First of all, I think it’s understandable and legitimate for trade union leaders to demand higher wages to maintain workers’ purchasing power in these circumstances. Wage developments are generally linked to productivity increases and medium-term inflation expectations, which are currently close to our inflation target of two per cent. Only if the wage settlements were to significantly and persistently exceed these measures could this accelerate inflation. But we are not seeing that at the moment at all. In most euro area countries, including Germany, wage demands are very moderate.  Let’s move on to a different topic. The ECB wants to redesign euro banknotes by 2024. The current ones show European architecture. Why is that no longer appropriate?  First of all – the euro is popular, not only in the countries that already use it. People have confidence in the single currency, which is why more countries want to join the euro area – Croatia in 2023, Bulgaria in 2024. The euro is popular internationally, too: the second-most important currency in the world after the US dollar is not the Japanese yen or the Chinese yuan – it is the euro. This is yet another reason why we should really think about what we want to showcase as Europeans.  What’s wrong with architecture?  Nothing. But have you ever looked closely at the banknotes? The structures shown on them do not exist in reality. Twenty years after the euro was introduced, it is time we asked ourselves whether there is something Europeans can identify with even more. Something we all see as typically European, something that unites us.  What do you have in mind?  Personally, I can envisage portraying famous Europeans: Leonardo da Vinci, Ludwig van Beethoven, James Joyce. I have fond memories of the five franc banknote showing Victor Hugo, which was in circulation in France 50 years ago. But I’m sure there are other ways to show European identity, for example with a famous painting or an architectural monument.  Can you imagine different countries having banknotes with different motifs, as is the case with coins?  This is just my personal opinion, as we have not yet discussed it at the ECB, but redesigning the banknotes is a good opportunity to show unity. This is what the European project is about – transcending borders to strengthen the economy and prevent war together. It would be a mistake to start reintroducing national differences now. We should identify things that unite rather than divide us.  The ECB is working on another project, too: the introduction of a digital euro. How would people benefit from that?  In some countries, most transactions are now cashless, and Europeans like to make payments on their computers and smartphones. At the same time, there are private providers trying to establish cryptocurrencies. We need to have an answer to that. We cannot allow users’ personal data to be monetised. Moreover, the technology used in private digital currencies also creates new, alarming opportunities, e.g. for terrorism financing and money laundering. This is why creating a digital euro must be a public project. It also strengthens Europe’s sovereignty.  What do you mean?  Many digital payments are now made using non-European systems, such as Visa, Mastercard or American Express. If you look at the situation around the supply of oil, gas or microchips, you notice the high price of dependence on external suppliers. This is where we lack autonomy. I think that we need to be just as cautious in the area of finance.  Is setting up a digital payments system part of the ECB’s tasks?  Yes, but the decision will be made together with the EU Member States and EU institutions. In any case, the ECB will remain the guardian of the euro, whether it’s digital or analogue. It will still be our job to supply cash. Even if we do get a great new digital euro, banknotes and coins will continue to exist. People are used to cash and are not willing to give it up. This is why I don’t think we need to have a discussion about scrapping cash. I also like having banknotes in my purse. And now they even have my signature on them (laughs).   "
2022-02-09,Isabel Schnabel,Q&A on Twitter,"Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 9 February 2022","   INTERVIEW  Q&A on Twitter   Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 9 February 2022 9 February 2022 Hello, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I’m looking forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Join the conversation! #AskECB   Can you explain the main mechanism by which raising rates would lower energy prices?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Raising rates would not lower energy prices. But if high current inflation threatens to lead to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, we may still need to respond, as our mandate is to preserve price stability. #AskECB   Following your 08.01.22 communication on green transition & inflation (one more communication masterpiece – thank you so much for doing it!), are there any further developments on this front that you may share?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Thank you for your kind words. The implications of the green transition for inflation are very important for monetary policy. We are currently working intensively on various topics related to climate change. Have a look: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/climate/html/index.en.html #AskECB  My speech on monetary policy and green transition is available here: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220108~0425a24eb7.en.html   #AskECB  Is inflation always a monetary phenomena?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The empirical link between money growth and inflation has weakened over recent decades. Inflation developments depend on the transmission of policy measures to the real economy, which hinges, for example, on the state of the banking sector. #AskECB   Wer garantiert die Unabhängigkeit der  @ecb   @Isabel_Schnabel ?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Unabhängigkeit der EZB wird durch die europäischen Verträge garantiert. Gemäß Artikel 130 AEUV darf die EZB keine Weisungen der Politik einholen oder entgegennehmen. Read more: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/educational/explainers/tell-me-more/html/ecb_independent.de.html #AskECB  The ECB’s independence is guaranteed by the European Treaties. According to Article 130 TFEU, the ECB must not seek or take instructions from governmental bodies. Read more: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/educational/explainers/tell-me-more/html/ecb_independent.en.html   Has ECB to follow capital keys in PEPP reinvestments?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Asset purchases under the PEPP are guided by the ECB’s capital key. In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. #AskECB   Some people believe that in the current situation, raising interest rates would help fight inflation. In your opinion: If current inflation is strongly driven by energy prices, why would an increase in interest rates help?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Monetary policy has to keep a watchful eye on all factors, including energy, that affect the medium-term inflation outlook. An extended period of high energy price inflation may lead to expectations of higher inflation in the future. #AskECB   #AskECB  Is the ECB thinking about how to tighten the monetary policy stance in a way that it actually makes us less dependent on fossil fuels and thus strengthen price stability for the long term? For instance like this  https://energymonitor.ai/finance/banking/the-ecb-can-help-fix-the-energy-price-crisis-play-the-long-game     @Isabel_Schnabel: Our economies will benefit from a faster transition to renewable energy sources. This is mainly the responsibility of governments. But we are committed to doing our part, which will be reflected in our monetary policy operations. #AskECB  Read more about our roadmap on greening our monetary policy, which was published as an outcome of our strategy review: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/climate/roadmap/html/index.en.html. #AskECB   #AskECB : Is the high inflation transitory?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation will remain high for longer than anticipated. There is a risk that inflation continues to rise in the near term but it is likely to gradually decline towards the end of this year. There remains high uncertainty around the inflation outlook. #AskECB   #AskECB  Why do you think ""this time is different"" i.e. no need for Volker's approach to hike 100% above CPI? Or do we need double digit first?   @Isabel_Schnabel: In the 1970s rising oil prices triggered a harmful price-wage spiral, as inflation expectations drifted away. Today longer-term inflation expectations are well-anchored. We will ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched. #AskECB   #AskECB  Do you think that inflation prediction models of the ECB are accurate? If not, is there any plan to fix it out? Do you think, that ECB is a trustworthy institution because of that?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Projections are always surrounded by uncertainty. But due to the pandemic and structural changes, the uncertainty around the inflation outlook is unusually high. You can trust us that we will take this uncertainty into account in our decision-making. #AskECB   Why is price stability the goal, if we could have prices decreasing?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Persistently falling prices may depress the economy because consumption and investment will be delayed as households and firms wait for lower prices. Read more: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/educational/explainers/tell-me-more/html/stableprices.en.html. #AskECB   When will you buy #Bitcoin?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Bitcoin is a speculative asset. The high volatility of its price makes it unsuitable as a store of value. #AskECB   Was ist das oberste Ziel der EZB?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Unser oberstes Ziel ist es, stabile Preise zu gewährleisten. Dabei streben wir mittelfristig eine Inflationsrate von 2% an. Seit seiner Einführung betrug die durchschnittliche Inflation im Euroraum 1,7%. #AskECB  Our primary objective is price stability. This means an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term. Since the introduction of the euro, average inflation in the euro area has amounted to 1.7%. #AskECB   Since central bankers, including the ECB, have repeatedly commented that they want to look through transitory spikes in inflation, do you think that looking through transitory phases of deflation is equally desirable?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Transitory supply shocks drive inflation and growth in opposite directions. That’s why central banks can usually look through their impact on inflation, both for upside and downside deviations from target. Our target is symmetric. #AskECB   Are you planning on further increasing the EU Housing bubble so I can never buy my own House?   @Isabel_Schnabel: House prices have risen strongly in the euro area, and monetary policy was one contributing factor. Macroprudential policy is the first line of defence but monetary policy needs to take financial stability and inequality considerations into account. #AskECB  Read my speeches on how monetary policy may deal with financial stability and with inequality: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp211208_2~97c82f5cfb.en.html   Dear  @Isabel_Schnabel at which level would treasury yields and intra-EMU spreads be without the bond buying programs of the ECB? Do you see any kind of “fiscal dominance”?  #AskECB http://ow.ly/qm1u50Ac4lS  (German version:  http://ow.ly/RSd950zpe1I )   @Isabel_Schnabel: ECB simulations show that the stock of assets acquired under APP and PEPP will put sizeable downward pressure on interest rates across the maturity spectrum for the years to come. Our actions are firmly geared towards our price stability objective. #AskECB   #AskECB  The ECB has done a great job with its PEPP during the pandemic. Now, government bond yields in Spain, Italy and Greece are on the rise. What will the  @ecb  do to ensure that we do not repeat the Eurocrisis? Thank you.   @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro area architecture is more resilient than it was at the time of the sovereign debt crisis, not least due to Next Generation EU which supports convergence across countries. The ECB has proven its willingness to act, if needed and as appropriate. #AskECB   #AskECB  - How would you explain the divergence in tone between the latest official statement and the communication delivered by C. Lagarde? To what level will the ECB accept the ""cost of transition"" towards normalization without affecting EZ financial conditions?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The monetary policy statement contained important changes regarding the upside risks to inflation and the need for optionality. The process of normalisation will be data-dependent and gradual, avoiding unnecessary disruptions. #AskECB   #AskECB  When discussing the future of monetary stance, does the Governing Council consider the movements of the yields? After the last ECB conference, which had a relatively hawkish stance, the IT 10-y surged by 19 bps & the Bunds climbed by 13 bps. The spread widens by 147 bps.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Financing conditions must remain in line with inflation stabilising at our target over the medium term. We also need to ensure that our policy is transmitted to all parts of the euro area. Therefore, yields are an important input into our analysis. #AskECB   Would ECB finally act on soaring inflation, high energy prices in the euro area or only protect stock markets?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our primary objective is price stability. We are ready to adjust all our tools to make sure that inflation stabilises at our 2% objective over the medium term. But any adjustment to our policy will be gradual. #AskECB   How successful would you say is the ECB in explaining the pillars of its policy to the wider public? To what extent do you see it as the ECB‘s task to explain its policy to the wider public?   @Isabel_Schnabel: In order to preserve trust among the general public, which is a prerequisite of successful monetary policy, we need to explain our policies in simple and accessible terms. We strive to continuously improve our communication towards the general public. #AskECB   Is there is a danger that measures on the balance sheet could renew financial fragmentation through asymmetric developments in monetary and financial conditions across the Eurozone? If yes, does it make sense to change the sequencing of envisaged monetary policy measures?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the conduct of asset purchases can help to counter fragmentation. Therefore, flexibility will remain an element of our monetary policy during the PEPP reinvestment phase. #AskECB   Are euro area sovereign yield spreads a bug or a feature?  #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel   @Isabel_Schnabel: Sovereign spreads are a feature as long as they are reflecting economic fundamentals. They are a bug when they become subject to destabilising self-fulfilling expectations, impairing monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   President Lagarde said today following a question from CNBC that ""we will look at the impact of inflation and its impact on projections in more depth in March, something we have not done so far"" My question does the ECB really have no scenario with high inflation and its impact?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy is data-dependent. We continuously analyse different scenarios. A full projection of economic developments is done only four times a year, with the next round being concluded in March. #AskECB   #AskECB  How does it come that you still expect inflation to fall below target over the medium term when we see non-financial companies expecting wage increases of ""3 percent or more this year"" and upcoming inflationary pressure of carbon prices? #wagepricespiral   @Isabel_Schnabel: Staff forecasts are going to be updated in March. What matters for inflation is the growth in wages over and above productivity growth. We carefully monitor wage developments as they are crucial for the inflation outlook. #AskECB   #AskECB  If the economy is in a great place why are interest rates zero or negative?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Negative rates reflect the low inflation environment before and at the beginning of the pandemic. Our policy is data-dependent. We continuously evaluate the monetary stimulus required for inflation to stabilise at our 2% target in the medium term. #AskECB   Do you think that the ECB is at risk of loosing its reputation as a well-functioning European institution as it's not able to fulfill its goal to protect EU citizens of the current inflationary development?  #AskECB  Thank you for offering this format!   @Isabel_Schnabel: We take people’s concerns about rising prices very seriously. You and all EU citizens can trust us that we will use all our instruments to stabilise inflation at our 2% target in the medium term. #AskECB   Bundesbank President Nagel says that ""the costs of acting too late are significantly higher than acting early"", the exact opposite of what ECB Board member Fabio Panetta said last year. The hawks need to explain what tighter policy will achieve in a supply shock.  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: We need to minimise the risks of both – acting too late and acting too early. Besides supply shocks, we have to assess the strong developments in the labour market and their implications for medium-term inflation. #AskECB   What’s the ECB’s current position about Euro cash and are you doing anything to stop the eurozone countries reducing even further the limits on the use of cash? The cash limit in Italy is currently 1.000 euro.  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Cash will stay an important way to pay and it is also a tangible symbol of European integration. We all use it almost every day. Limits on the use of cash are the responsibility of national governments. #AskECB   Following scenario: A land with the euro is inside of a wage price spiral, while all other lands arent, so the inflation only escalates in one land. what would the ecb do?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy is guided by developments in the euro area as a whole. But it is important to analyse heterogenous country developments to understand how our policy is affecting different parts of the euro area and to adjust our tools if needed. #AskECB   #AskECB  And now you say you are data dependent, Why is the sequence so important that you can not deviate., as you don’t know what the data, that you say you depend on, will show.   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to the announced sequencing, we will end net asset purchases before we raise interest rates. Continued bond purchases would offset part of the impact of increasing policy rates. Moreover, asset purchases come with increasing costs. #AskECB  See my speech on the changing role of asset purchases: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210920~ae2c7412dc.en.html   #AskECB  In light of the need to furher strengthen euro's architecture and enhance 'monetary peace' within the eurozone, when does the ECB plan to implement the third pillar of the banking union (European Deposit Insurance Scheme – EDIS)?   @Isabel_Schnabel: A European Deposit Insurance Scheme is an important – and still missing – part of banking union. It would enhance financial stability and increase trust in the banking system. However, this is not up to the ECB but to the EU and its member states. #AskECB   Define “transitory”.  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Due to lags in policy transmission “transitory” shocks typically do not require policy action. They matter for monetary policy when there is a risk that they become entrenched in expectations, requiring policy action to protect price stability. #AskECB   How much of current European inflation is due the big stimulus earlier last year in America? Did that lead to the higher energy prices in China and the rest of the world?   @Isabel_Schnabel: One reason for rising oil prices was the stronger-than-expected recovery across many economies, with demand outpacing supply. The large fiscal stimulus in the US was one factor driving the global recovery. #AskECB   In the eventuality of a policy tightening, will the ECB carry out a proportionality test to evaluate the relative impact of an interest rate hike on the cost of transition energy sources vs. fossil fuels investments?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our climate action plan, we will include climate change considerations into our monetary policy. Changes will apply to monetary expansion as well as to tightening. Our actions will continue to be guided by our price stability objective. #AskECB   How is ecb adressing the endogeneity problem between inflation expectations and exogeneous shocks which are out of central banks control? How is ecb preventing a potential unanchoring of inflation expecations?   @Isabel_Schnabel: If there is a risk that inflation expectations become unanchored, we need to take action even if the shock is exogenous. Currently, longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored. #AskECB   #AskECB  Prognosis models 2% Inflation by the end of Q4 '22. We are in an unprecedented economic situation. Models have been wrong in the recent past. Q: What are the planned actions if Inflation stays well above target?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Due to the pandemic and structural changes in the economy, uncertainty around the inflation outlook is unusually high. If we judge that inflation will remain above our target over the medium term, the ECB will adjust its monetary policy, as appropriate. #AskECB   With inflation rates well above the target, why are you still continuing to buy bonds?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: The economy is recovering. The progress made towards our 2% inflation target over the medium term permits a step-by-step reduction in our asset purchases. We will reassess the implications of the incoming data for the inflation outlook in March. #AskECB   Why you said on the German news 1 month ago that "" this Inflation is good , we want more Inflation "" ??   @Isabel_Schnabel: For a long time euro area inflation was below our target but it is now moving towards 2% in the medium term. Current inflation is painfully high – mostly due to high energy prices. We will ensure that it will not persist over the medium term. #AskECB   #AskECB . thank you for answering our Qs today. Here is a statement from @Lagarde yesterday. Does that mean  @ecb  is giving up its price stability mandate & sees no issue with the lower-income being hurt the most? Are there any plans to take action?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We know that high inflation causes significant hardship for people who bear the rising costs of food, housing and transportation. We will make sure that inflation stabilises at our 2% target over the medium term. #AskECB   Why is the ECB adjusting so slowly and flexibly to the high inflation compared to the instant, unprecedented and persistent adjustment in policy at the onset of Covid? The deviation from inflation target is far larger now and is hurting consumers more at the same time.  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has risen mainly due to energy prices which we cannot affect directly. But we are seeing that inflationary pressures are broadening and becoming more persistent. Policy optionality is therefore more important than ever. #AskECB   Do you think TLTROs are still a useful tool for guaranteeing a correct transmission of monetary policy?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: TLTROs remain an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting lending to firms and households. We will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations does not hamper the transmission of our monetary policy. #AskECB   when you calculate the inflation rate - how much do you look at the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the potential disruption it could cause?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Geopolitical developments are part of our risk assessment, especially if they affect energy prices and growth. Our upcoming Economic Bulletin looks at the dependence on natural gas in the euro area and the related risks to economic activity. #AskECB   1: What is money? 2: Are there good or bad money? And what is the difference between good and bad money?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Money is a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. “Good” money fulfils all three functions. The euro is “good” money: it enjoys high trust in the euro area and beyond.

2022-01-25,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Verslo žinios,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Emilis Linge and Dalius Simenas","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Verslo žinios   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Emilis Linge and Dalius Simenas 25 January 2022  I just read the news this morning that the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index published this Monday shows that the eurozone economic recovery weakened further in January. This is due to the new restrictions imposed to contain the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19). So what is your opinion on the state of the eurozone today, after two years of the pandemic and what are the prospects?  In the near term, there are some risks from the Omicron variant. But I think it's increasingly clear that the impact is only for a few weeks. So it is not turning out to be a factor that will influence the activity levels for the year, it's more the activity levels for a few weeks. In that sense, I think there's less concern about Omicron than we had in December. In terms of the overall pandemic, I think it is fair to say that the recovery so far has been stronger than expected − compared to, for example, early 2020 when the pandemic hit. In the initial months of the pandemic there was a lot of concern. But essentially, when the vaccines have been rolled out during 2021, it turned out that the euro area economy and the world economy has recovered more quickly than expected. And looking to this year, 2022, we expect another strong year of recovery. So essentially, there's been a strong recovery, supported by a lot of policy measures, both fiscal policy and monetary policy. I think in overall terms the sense is that, between the public health measures and other measures, it's turning out that we can hope that the euro area can recover quite well from the pandemic.  Let's go to the start of the pandemic. The euro area economy as a whole shrank more than 6 per cent in 2020. However, Ireland's economy grew 3.4 per cent. And the Lithuanian economy escaped the recession too. To your mind, why did the Lithuanian economy and the Irish economy manage to decouple from the recessionary trends in the euro area last year?  What I think is that some sectors in the world economy were able to continue during the pandemic. So in those sectors where the pandemic might cause an interruption for a few months, even during 2020 it turned out there was a good recovery. The sectors where Lithuania is a big producer and the sectors where Ireland is a big producer, including a lot of multinational firms, turned out to be quite strong. But I would say both in Ireland and in Lithuania many sectors suffered. The fact that in overall terms, these economies did grow, should not take away from the fact that many service-type industries would have been damaged by the pandemic.  Euro area inflation hit a record high of 5 per cent in December of last year. Are you worried about further rising inflation in the eurozone?  We should think about these years of the pandemic, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as part of a pandemic cycle. In the first year 2020, inflation was relatively low. In the second half of 2021, inflation turned out to be quite high. And then, as we look into this year, 2022, we think inflation will remain high at the start of this year, but will fall later this year, especially towards the end of the year. So it's a year, essentially, where in the first part of the year, we'll still see inflation remaining high. But we do expect it to fall quite a bit later this year.  Do you expect inflation to rise further than 5 per cent at the start of the year? And what levels do you expect at the end of the year?  We are clear from our December forecast that we expect inflation − in overall terms for this year − to be around 3.2 per cent in the euro area, and then to be below 2 per cent in 2023 and 2024. Compared with the peak, that's quite a big decline. We will see exactly the timing of how quickly inflation falls. So rather than focus on month by month, we have a clear vision in terms of the overall direction: that the inflation rate will fall later this year. And in fact, as you know, our current view from December is that inflation will fall below the 2 per cent target in the next couple of years.  What ECB monetary policy adjustments do you expect in the face of rising energy goods and services prices if the rise is higher than your forecasts?  I think we are always clear that we’re guided by our intentions to deliver an inflation rate of 2 per cent over the medium term. So we will adjust all of our policies − whether that's asset purchases, the targeted lending programme, our interest rates − to deliver that goal. You've given me a hypothetical, the hypothetical is: what happens if inflation is above our forecast. So let me in turn make clear that what is very important is whether inflation will essentially settle at around our target of 2 per cent, which would be essentially what we want, or whether there might be signs of inflation being above 2 per cent in a significant way for a significant amount of time. And if we saw the data coming in to suggest that inflation would be too high relative to 2 per cent, then of course we would respond. We also have been clear on our sequence. The first decision under that scenario would be to end net purchasing. And only after ending net asset purchases would we look at the criteria for raising the interest rates. So we will be driven by the data, driven by our assessment. And every month, every quarter, we're going to learn more about where the data are going.  Is there a risk of inflationary second round effects such as salary growth?  We spend a lot of time looking at the interlinkages. One linkage is that an increase in the cost of living may be a factor in wage negotiations. We think that is clear. The question is how much, because, remember, energy is both a direct cost to the consumer, but also a cost to other firms. Rising energy prices can also mean rising food prices, rising prices of goods and services. We are also examining how much the increase in energy prices might show up in rising goods prices and services prices. So far, we do not see a big response of wages. We do expect a response of wages but what is critical is how big. Because, remember, in the euro area, for inflation to be around 2 per cent and allowing for a typical increase in labour productivity of about 1 per cent, then wages should be growing around 3 per cent a year in the euro area on average to be consistent with the 2 per cent target. We are not, right now, seeing wage increases in that zone. But of course, we will continue to look at this throughout the year.  Some of your colleagues have mentioned another risk. Do you see any pressure to the rise of inflation in the euro area due to the green energy investments?  I think this is a complicated issue. Let me also emphasise that what we have right now is an increase in global energy prices. The euro area imports energy from the rest of the world. So this is a very different scenario from a scenario, which we would expect to occur in the coming years. Which is essentially, if there’s, for example, policies that increase the price of carbon, as part of the transition away from a high-carbon economy. If we see an increase in the price of carbon because of taxes or regulation, driven by domestic policy, those revenues from a carbon tax, for example, can be recycled in the domestic economy and can stimulate the economy. Wheras what we have right now is different. We have an increase in import prices from the rest of the world. And this is reducing living standards, increasing the import bill. It has a negative channel to lower incomes, lower consumption. So I think it's a very interesting, very important debate about the future of green energy policies. That is playing some role right now. But the main role right now is a global issue, rather than the transition. So we will return to this topic, no doubt.  So overall, what scenarios do you see where interest rates in the eurozone could be lifted?  Let me mention three scenarios. And again, to repeat, we're examining hypotheticals here. One scenario is in fact that the forces that generated low inflation before the pandemic essentially become visible again after the pandemic. So one scenario is that the world economy will return to quite low inflation rates. A second scenario is that some of these headwinds will not return and, in fact, it may be easier for us to deliver our target of 2 per cent. So that is a kind of middle scenario where inflation will stabilise at 2 per cent. And then the third scenario is, if inflation picks up and there is a risk that inflation will be significantly above 2 per cent. In this third scenario, where inflation is significantly above 2 per cent on a persistent basis, then that will call for a monetary policy tightening. We would have to respond. In the middle scenario where inflation stabilises at 2 per cent, then clearly over time we would normalise monetary policy. The policies we need to fight very low inflation would no longer be needed if inflation were stable around 2 per cent. And in the first scenario where inflation is significantly below 2 per cent, then the policies that we have employed to fight low inflation would still remain relevant. So this is the way I think about the world, but there are three scenarios. One, we remain with a low inflation problem. Two, we stabilise -- in a kind of smooth way -- inflation around 2 per cent. And three, if inflation turns out to be persistently above 2 per cent, we would have to tighten. And so those are three very different scenarios.  Which of these three scenarios do you see as the most likely scenario in this economic environment?  In the December round of projections, the assessment was that, in fact, we saw inflation returning to below 2 per cent. But we also emphasised that in a world of uncertainty, as we have more data come in, of course the data can change. But in the euro area context, I would say that it's also possible that we may enter a world where inflation stabilises around 2 per cent. I find it less likely to think about a scenario where inflation is persistently, significantly above 2 per cent, which would require a serious tightening. That scenario, would, I think, in the context of the euro area, be less likely than the other two scenarios.  Higher sovereign borrowing costs after the financial crisis of 2007-09 turned into a eurozone debt crisis in 2010-13 that hit some southern European Member States, also Ireland. Debt levels have significantly risen during the pandemic. Is there any risk of another debt crisis this time provided interest rates will rise?  Let me make two important points here. One, at that time, there was a significant combination which, by and large, countries had of both high private sector debt – many households, many firms were highly indebted - and there was high government debt. That is a major problem. What we've seen in this pandemic is: yes, governments have borrowed more, and some types of firms have borrowed more. But households have been saving a lot. In the banking sector, we also have banks which are better able to handle debt, because they have increased their capital positions. So, when you have a situation where, essentially, in the euro area, debt levels have gone up for the sovereign and for some corporates but have gone down for households, and where the banks, that are kind of in the middle of the system, are in better shape, then I think it's a different scenario to ten years ago. And then the other issue is: we think the trend level of interest rates is lower today than ten years ago. So, when interest rates go up, it's from a very low level. And that's important.  Finally, I have one question as to the elephant in the room: the deteriorating geopolitical situation in Ukraine these days due to the possible Russian military offensive. Do you see any side effects to the ECB monetary policy, should the geopolitical situation in Europe deteriorate further?  Geopolitics always matters. I think if you look at the history of the world economy, the European economy, geopolitical events matter a lot via trade, via global prices, via uncertainty. So, of course, we will be looking very closely at such factors. We already talked about the very high energy prices. And of course, there's a connection between higher energy prices and these tensions. So of course, it's very directly relevant for us.   "
2022-01-14,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Markus Zydra, Bastian Brinkmann and Meike Schreiber on 10 January 2022 ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Markus Zydra, Bastian Brinkmann and Meike Schreiber on 10 January 2022  14 January 2022  Ms Schnabel, inflation in the euro area now stands at 5% – a record high. When are you finally going to intervene?  We view these figures with some concern, as they are higher than we initially expected. And we fully understand many people’s worries about the drop in real wages and interest income – all the more so as people on lower incomes are hit particularly hard by higher inflation. We take that very seriously.   Concerns alone will not bring inflation down.   Our decisions are based on a medium-term perspective covering around one to three years. We expect that inflation will fall significantly over the medium term. That is why we are not raising interest rates now, as some are calling for.   Long-term planning is all very well, but people are being hit by higher prices here and now.   Any measures we might take today will only have an effect with a lag. The current rate of inflation won’t be affected, only the future one. Most forecasts – our own and others − indicate that the surge in inflation caused by the pandemic will be followed by a marked decline. In our projections, medium-term inflation will even fall back below our target of 2%, even though we acknowledge that the projections are now subject to great uncertainty. That is why we should not raise interest rates prematurely, as that could potentially choke off the recovery. But we will act quickly and decisively if we conclude that inflation may settle above 2%. A precondition for raising interest rates is to end net asset purchases; and our December decision is a first step in this direction.   And if you get it wrong, we all pay a high price.   That’s exactly why we don’t base our decisions solely on economic models but also conduct surveys about expectations among households and firms, for example. This enables us to cross-check the plausibility of the projections. And these surveys do indeed show upward risks with respect to inflation. We are aware that monetary policy bears a huge responsibility for people’s prosperity. But premature action by monetary policy would also come at a price: it could hold back the nascent recovery, and that would jeopardise jobs.   But doesn’t the ECB’s inaction so far in truth reflect its fear that the euro debt crisis might flare up again, first and foremost in Italy, and that stock markets might collapse?  I know that some people in Germany take this view, but it’s not the case. Our actions are guided solely by our price stability mandate. Public borrowing by individual countries has no bearing on the Governing Council’s decisions. How financial markets will respond to the exit from our expansionary monetary policy measures is obviously an aspect that we need to consider because it affects the financing conditions for households and firms. But that is an entirely different matter to keeping interest rates low purely to help certain countries repay their debt.   EU surveys show that people perceive inflation to be even higher than measured. Doesn’t this perceived inflation harm your reputation?   Inflation is officially calculated using an average consumption basket; the selection of goods bought by an individual consumer typically differs. Moreover, people perceive some price changes more strongly than others, particularly for goods they consume frequently. The prices of petrol and heating fuel, for example, are now increasing significantly, with the result that perceived inflation is higher than actual inflation. We have an inflation calculator on our website which allows people to discover their individual inflation rate. In addition, when calculated over a longer period, inflation has not increased as much as suggested by latest figures. If one compares prices today with prices two years ago, one sees that average annual inflation in Germany in December was just 2.5%, as prices actually fell in the first year of the pandemic.   To ask a fundamental question: why are you aiming for inflation of 2%? Surely 0% is far more stable.   Let me mention two important reasons. First, we steer inflation for the entire euro area. At an average rate of 0%, some Member States would be experiencing deflation, which economists see as very harmful. Second, a slightly positive inflation target facilitates economic adjustment processes geared to preserving competitiveness. It enables a reduction in real, i.e. inflation-adjusted, wages. As nominal wages typically do not decline, any necessary adjustments could otherwise lead to higher unemployment.   Okay, that might sound plausible, but it’s very hard to understand. How do you intend to convince people on that basis?   Our policy can only succeed if people trust the ECB. That’s why we take every effort to explain complex topics in the simplest form possible. Perhaps we don’t always manage. However, that doesn’t mean we should pursue an inappropriate monetary policy just because we are worried that our measures are difficult to explain – that would have negative economic consequences. We must instead keep doing our best to make our actions understood.   At the regulars’ table and online, you don’t just face criticism; you’re now also attacked personally and an object of hate. How do you deal with that?  That can be very unpleasant. I try to ignore personal attacks. But Twitter, for instance, is a great medium, because I get feedback straight from people, some of whom I don’t know personally, who want to tell me something – directly and unfiltered. I also monitor what the tabloids are saying. Some things are exaggerated, but they do reflect the mood of the people, and it’s important for us to understand that mood. All in all, we’ve not yet done a good enough job of finding simple words to explain monetary policy. For that reason, we are putting a lot of energy into communication. We have to get even better in this regard.  Energy prices are driving up inflation fast. What annoys you more: the high price of petrol or the rising cost of heating?  I know that particularly the rising energy costs are a severe problem for many people right now. One of the reasons why energy prices have risen so sharply is that economic activity picked up strongly after the easing of the strict lockdown measures. In turn, the demand for energy took off, and supply was not able to catch up quickly. This caused prices for raw materials to rise at a pace that took many by surprise. Monetary policy cannot reduce the price of oil or gas. Instead, we are asking ourselves whether second-round effects will result from the high energy prices. This would imply that other goods and services would also become more expensive and wages would start rising, which could lead to a more persistent increase in inflation.  One way or another, that’s coming: transitioning to a climate-neutral economy is making carbon more expensive – and that will make almost everything else more expensive too. Is the goal of price stability at odds with the goal of climate neutrality?  There are ongoing debates about the impact of the green transition on inflation. If it leads to higher inflation, monetary policy needs to react under certain circumstances. This is especially the case if higher inflation threatens to become entrenched in people’s expectations, or if the green transition triggers an economic boom that in turn leads to rising prices.  In simple terms, higher interest rates. So the ECB could hamper the politically desirable transformation to a climate-neutral economy. Is a climate conflict likely to break out between central bankers and politicians?  The ECB is committed to price stability. The transition to a climate-neutral economy will require a change in relative prices, and the prime responsibility for this rests with the governments. The sooner we succeed in creating low-carbon alternatives, the smoother the transformation will be.  There was talk about you becoming Bundesbank President, but Joachim Nagel got the nod. Wouldn’t it have been about time to choose a woman in 2022?  I really look forward to working with Joachim Nagel. He’s a good choice – and I’m really happy here at the ECB. At 8% – or two out of 25 members – the proportion of women on the ECB’s Governing Council is of course disappointingly low. The German government could have contributed to increasing that share.  ECB President Christine Lagarde and you want to do more for women at the ECB. How?  This has been on the agenda for some time but has gained greater momentum under Madame Lagarde. Our research indicates that women at the ECB apply for promotions less often, even if they would have good chance to succeed. So, we are now explicitly encouraging women to apply. Since then, the figures have improved significantly. In addition, our gender strategy features explicit targets of 50% for new hires and promotions. We are already noticing that this makes a difference.  Discrimination and poor treatment of women at work are structural problems and occur everywhere. How is the ECB responding to the “Me Too” movement?  I’m not aware of any specific instances of sexual harassment at the ECB. But of course that doesn’t mean that this is true. How are we dealing with this? For one, the ECB is making every effort to create as inclusive an environment as possible, in which the probability of something like that happening is small. Sexual harassment is likely related to the general working atmosphere, like how we are dealing with hierarchies. At the same time, it must be possible for the people affected to report cases, and they must enjoy comprehensive protection when they do so. We have dedicated contact persons in every business area. We have also set up a whistleblowing platform where people can report incidents anonymously. And last but not least, we survey our staff regularly about the working environment and topics like diversity and inclusion. The ECB would certainly not tolerate such breaches in any form.  Particularly at the ECB, many staff stay for a very long time. Doesn’t this mean that you should actively investigate whether there were any cases earlier?  We started asking about inappropriate behaviour in our internal surveys in 2018. To date we have not received any indication that would suggest sexual harassment has taken place. We haven’t yet discussed whether we should investigate further back into the past. But that is certainly worthwhile to consider. What is important for us is to keep improving our structures and reporting systems.   "
2022-01-11,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabella Bufacchi","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabella Bufacchi 11 January 2022  Euro area HICP inflation in December hit another record all-time high. Maybe a peak. Markets are now even more convinced that the ECB is going to raise interest rates at the end of this year. Is this data going to derail your monetary policy stance?  In our December projections we assessed that inflation at the end of 2021, including in the month of December, was going to be high. But we also believe that inflation will fall this year, and that it will go below our 2 per cent target in 2023 and 2024. This is driving our monetary policy assessment. We are looking beyond the inflation we have right now: monetary policy is based on the medium term.   European citizens are paying more for food, petrol, electricity. How far can the ECB tolerate prices shooting up? Is inflation really only “moderately” higher than your target?  The 5 per cent inflation number in December is unusually high. This is dominated by the fact that energy went up by 26 per cent last year. The key issue for us as the central bank is: do we see changes in household and firm decisions? Do we see changes in wage behaviour? But we do not see behaviour that would suggest inflation will remain above our target into the medium term.   Did you expect inflation to be so high in December? Was 5 per cent in the Eurosystem staff projections at the time of the December Governing Council meeting?  It is within the margin of error of what we expected. We knew we would have a concentration of price pressures at the end of 2021, especially the big surge in energy prices. This is visible in the December data, but the basic narrative remains in place.  By this you mean that interest rates are not going to go up this year?  This goes back to our December assessment that inflation will not only fall this year but will settle below our target in 2023 and 2024. The criteria for moving interest rates up are therefore not in place. This remains our view. As the year goes by, we will have more data and will continue to assess the situation.  Many market players still expect the first interest rate hike in the euro area at the end of this year: is there a problem of communication?  The data we have, make it quite unlikely that the criteria we set to raise interest rates will be fulfilled this year. Next year and the year after that, the same criteria will apply: these criteria are very clear and the market can study them. But let me focus on one element, we have a cross-check: to raise interest rates, we need to see sufficient progress in underlying inflation. The pandemic makes it more difficult to interpret indicators of underlying inflation. It will take some time to filter out the effects of the pandemic – base effects, supply bottlenecks and so on − and to have a proper assessment of what is going on with underlying inflation. We have highlighted on a regular basis that the central element in understanding underlying inflation is to find out what happens to the trend in wages. We will be looking at wage settlements throughout the year. Behind prices are costs, and the most important cost in the economy is wages. Labour costs are a big part of the overall price level, and labour costs tend to move on a more persistent and more gradual basis. Energy moves are abrupt, energy can go up and down in a volatile way. But a significant move in the persistent and underlying source of inflation is unlikely unless you see wages picking up quite a bit. Until now, the wage data do not indicate any major acceleration in underlying inflation.  US core inflation is expected to be 2.7 per cent this year. The Federal Reserve said it will raise rates “sooner or at a faster pace”; three hikes are expected in 2022 and three in 2023. The ECB rates are on hold. Does the euro area risk importing inflation with a weaker euro and a stronger US dollar?  It is important to see foreign exchange as part of the pandemic cycle. In 2020 we had a euro appreciation. In recent months, some of that appreciation was reversed. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, we had an initial appreciation of the euro, and now a depreciation. It is not a major element. I would not overly focus on the exchange rate.  Why is the ECB monetary accommodation being extended while the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England start tightening? Why is the ECB so far apart?  There is a crystal-clear difference. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the assessment is that inflation will not stabilise at the target of around 2 per cent unless there is a monetary policy tightening. The discussion about monetary tightening there depends on the assessment that inflation will remain above target: then monetary tightening is considered necessary. Our assessment for the euro area is different − inflation is expected not only to go back to the target but also to fall below the target − therefore our monetary policy reaction is different. This is the key issue.  It is crystal clear, but there is also confusion due to exceptional factors – the pandemic and bottlenecks – that are having an impact on inflation, with no historical parallel that can be made.   It is important to recognise the pervasive impact of the pandemic on inflation. Look at the three pandemic years, that is, 2020, 2021 and 2022. In 2020, we had low inflation or even disinflation. And this was one of the motivations for us to react with the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP): inflation was too low. The ECB has a symmetric view: too high inflation and too low inflation are equally undesirable. In 2021, the world economy and the European economy recovered more quickly than expected. There was a fast recovery driven by vaccinations, demand was strong and supply could not keep up due to bottlenecks. In the initial stage of the pandemic, some countries reacted with special measures, such as the VAT cut in Germany, which drew up prices when it was reversed in 2021. We have a lot of special factors that are leading to unusually low inflation in 2020 and unusually high inflation in 2021. I see 2022 as a transition phase, gradually going out of the pandemic. The high pressure on inflation in 2021 will be fading this year, but 2022 is still part of the pandemic cycle. And when the pandemic is over, in 2023 and 2024, inflation will stabilise at a lower level, at about 1.8 per cent, which is much closer to our target compared to what we had before the pandemic. Inflation is not just going back to its pre-pandemic level. We have made progress by providing monetary policy support and fiscal support. The economic recovery in 2023 and 2024 in the euro area will bring inflation closer to our target.   Is the economic recovery solid in the euro area and in Italy? Can bottlenecks jeopardise the recovery?   Bottlenecks are another temporary factor: if there is a shortfall in production today, it means there is going to be more production later on. The order book is very good. Overall, in Europe we see a solid growth engine this year, next year and the year after that. This applies also to Italy. First, there is the bounceback from the pandemic. Italy was hit very hard in 2020 and it had a strong recovery in 2021, even if some sectors, such as tourism and travel, are not back to normal. Next Generation EU (NGEU) is another engine for growth and Italy is amongst the primary recipients. This is where I see the difference between the pandemic and the great financial crisis: we now have medium-term growth engines − NGEU will last for several years. Moreover, this time the banking system provided support for the recovery. The banking system is stronger. Now, there is more support for the recovery.  Italy’s growth is solid, but the BTP-Bund spread is widening, in spite of more flexibility in PEPP reinvestments to intervene against fragmentation. The ECB has always found instruments to intervene against fragmentation: the Securities Markets Programme, Outright Monetary Transactions, then PEPP net purchases: but why is flexibility now only in PEPP reinvestments?  In December, the Governing Council decided to end net purchases under the PEPP in March and to use PEPP reinvestments in a flexible way if needed. But to provide total clarity, we also considered it a good idea to remind people in more general terms that our mandate is price stability, and that on some occasions, to deliver our mandate, we have to use instruments and programmes that can be flexible to counter fragmentation. So in December we also said that if there is a threat to price stability, and this threat is fragmentation, under stressed conditions we will implement monetary policy in a flexible way. This is quite straightforward. It is a restatement of what the ECB needs to do: the ECB cannot always run monetary policy in a mechanical way in the euro area, where 19 countries adopt a single monetary policy. What is important is that we reiterate our flexibility when it is appropriate. And then we have the specific reminder that, as we move into the next phase in the recovery, we said we have a mechanism, PEPP reinvestments, by which we can deal with fragmentation risk.   The Federal Reserve will reduce its balance sheet after the first interest rate hike. The PEPP’s portfolio will be reinvested until 2024. And the asset purchase programme is still open-ended. When will the ECB balance sheet shrink? When will banks repay the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs)?  With the TLTROs, the decisions are driven by banks: so long as TLTRO funding is available, it is up to banks to decide whether to replace TLTROs with funding on the market. As for the ECB balance sheet, there is a clear sequence: net purchases stop before the first interest rate increase, and only well after the first increase in interest rates will the central bank think about shrinking its balance sheet. This principle is valid for all central banks, it is fairly universal. But the ECB is further away from increasing interest rates than some other central banks. So the debate on when to start shrinking our balance sheet is also further away; the shrinkage of our balance sheet is much more a topic for the future than for today.  Asset purchasing is linked to interest rate hikes. The last ECB interest rate hike was more than ten years ago, in 2011: a rate hike could take markets by surprise. Is the ECB worried about price correction and asset valuation triggered by monetary policy tightening?  Investors, academics, they all know very well that in a world of low interest rates, rates eventually go up and there are implications for asset prices. Any bank, insurance company or pension fund will allow for this risk. Regulators and supervisors also think a lot about this. So it will not come as a surprise that at some point in time rates, short-term rates or long-term rates, will go up. But I also disagree that monetary policy has a significant surprise element. This is in contrast to major financial crisis episodes, for example what happened in September 2008, which came as a big surprise. It’s important for central banks to be clear, to be predictable. And I think we are very clear on interest rates and we are very predictable. The world can adapt to higher rates, and many institutions will already have allowed for this risk in their planning.   My last question is not on interest rates or monetary policy but on your very detailed proposal for the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. Can you give your thoughts on the reform?  Let me give some initial suggestions at a personal level. One topic is that the fiscal framework should combine debt sustainability with fiscal countercyclicality. Fiscal policy must be sustainable in the longer term, but it should not aggravate the business cycle by loosening during expansion and tightening during recession. For debt sustainability, I agree we must see high debts coming down. But in a world of low rates, maybe an adjustment path can allow for a more moderate pace of reduction (for example, at 3 per cent per annum rather than the current 5 per cent). A second point is that the inflation element could be incorporated in the fiscal framework: fiscal policy has a bigger multiplier when interest rates are low and when inflation is low. But the debate has just started, it is early days, these ideas will be part of the debate in the European institutions.  Some proposals have been made, going as far as asking the ECB to sell its government bonds to specific buyers: would this be possible?  There is an important separation. The fiscal framework is for Member States and the European Union to decide. We are clear in our strategy: our monetary policy and our balance sheet is driven by price stability and by what is needed to stabilise inflation at our 2 per cent target. The fiscal framework cannot imply any particular imposition on the ECB. Fiscal policy matters a lot to the ECB. But there is a clear separation between fiscal policy and monetary policy. "

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Robert Shortt on 7 January and published on 7 January 2022 7 January 2022  Philip Lane, what's your response to the Eurostat flash estimate for December showing the euro area inflation on the new record high 5%.  That number is broadly in line with what we expected. We’ve been clear, in recent weeks and months, that there is a peak of inflation at the end of 2021. And this number of 5 per cent in December should be interpreted in the context of the pandemic. The pandemic in 2020, the first year, led to unusually low inflation. Some of that reversed in 2021. And now, in 2022, we have a third leg of this pandemic episode, where we do think this year inflation is going to come down. It’s going to be above where we want it to be in the long term, but this three-year period – 2020, 2021, 2022 – is basically part of a pandemic cycle in inflation.  So in that sense, it should not be -- I think -- interpreted in terms of comparing to historical norms. The pandemic is a unique episode. Only a few weeks ago, in our December meeting, we looked at the prognosis for this year, for 2023, 2024, and our analysis is that inflation will be coming down in 2022. And in fact, we project inflation to be a little bit below our target in 2023 and 2024. So yes, when we hear numbers like 5 per cent in December 2021, that sounds so strange, after a long period of low inflation, but again, to repeat we do think that the inflation pressures will be easing over the course of this year. And in fact, we think inflation in 2023 and 2024 will be a little bit below where we would like it to be in terms of our target.  Are you confident that it will be noticeably weaker, which is one of the phrases one of your colleagues used, over the course of this year?  Well, I think we are confident about that for some very simple reasons. Number one is there’s a mechanical effect, which is: during the pandemic in some countries – most importantly in Germany, but also here in Ireland – in 2020 VAT rates were cut. So that meant inflation in 2020 was unusually low. When those VAT cuts were reversed in 2021, it means in 2021 inflation was temporarily high. But that is over now. In 2022, we don’t have that VAT effect, so that kind of a mechanical effect, which means that even this month of January 2022, inflation will be lower, down from December, for that very simple reason.  And what about this notion that inflation could be more stubborn and persistent than you think?  We always -- when we look at inflation -- recognise there are risks on both sides. There are risks that inflation could be above our forecasts, but also risks that inflation could be below our forecasts. So we have to look at both of those scenarios. So of course, there is a lot of attention to be paid to the scenario of inflation being above our forecast, And we will be monitoring the situation, and I think I've repeatedly said actually that the most important element of what we need to look at is what’s going to happen to wage behaviour over the course of this year.  The ECB has said that it expects energy prices to stabilise this year. What’s the basis for that belief, given that there’s such ongoing political uncertainty, particularly about gas supplies to Europe?  So, in the December numbers that came out this morning, energy prices, the whole energy category, rose by 26 per cent in 2021. Now let me also, of course, remind you that in 2020, energy prices fell. So a part of this is just a reversal. But the fact that energy prices have risen so much is a major concern. So let me generalise this point: of course, we have to think about it in terms of the inflation consequences, but the European economy is a major importer of energy. Collectively, Europe paying so much more for energy inputs is a major economic issue. Now the fact that prices have risen so much does mean -- compared to last year’s rate of increase -- there’s probably less upside this year. But there are factors we need to look at, with geopolitical issues among them, for sure. On the other hand, what we do think is: supply will shift, pressures should ease in the aggregate this year. In the oil market, we think supply pressures will ease. But as you indicated, the gas market is quite important for energy in Europe. And there are all sorts of different dynamics going on there. But I would remind you, of course that the supply responses are happening there as well, in terms of, for example, the shipping of liquefied natural gas around the world being redirected to Europe. So we will keep an eye on this. It’s a very important issue that’s much broader than the ECB issue. The fact that energy prices have gone up so much is a major economic policy issue in general.  The ECB significantly increased its forecast for inflation this year at the Governing Council meeting last month. And I suppose it raised a lot of eyebrows because of the scale of the revision. How confident are you now that your updated forecasts are correct?  So, in the December staff forecast, which reflected a big exercise across the Eurosystem – the ECB and the 19 central banks – that’s essentially a major exercise to come up with these forecasts. We do think it captures a lot of what is most likely to happen. And so, in terms of forecasts, it’s reflecting the most likely scenario. But as we talked about a little bit earlier on, we will be paying attention to both upside risks and downside risks to that forecast. And the energy sector is a very prominent index. We’ve just had that discussion, that there are forces on either side in relation to energy inflation. But probably the most important message in this is: we have monthly data, as we’re talking about today. We will have new forecasts in March, in June, in September. So as the new data come in, whether it comes in stronger, exactly on track or weaker than we expected, the ECB will always be responding because we have a new strategy. And we’re crystal clear: that strategy is, we're intent on delivering inflation stabilised at 2 per cent in the medium term. So anything that threatens inflation above 2 per cent over the medium term we will be responding to. Equally, any force that threatens to push inflation below 2 per cent, we will also respond to. So this is a very clear strategy. And that essentially will guide us.  Just as a quick add-on to that question. Is it fair to say that, in the latter half of last year, the ECB was surprised by the spike in inflation?  I think that’s a fair issue. But that reflects, as we talked about, when we saw this really large surge in energy prices. That is the overwhelming dominant issue. And as I indicated, it’s much broader than just of concern for the ECB. And what’s important is: the energy sector has different components. We have what’s happening to the price of oil, and traditionally the price of oil and the price of gas have moved together, but for various reasons gas prices have moved in a different track in these months. So yes, this has been quite an event and remains something we need to look at. And, if you like, the volatility of the energy market is a primary issue for policymakers.  In simple terms, what does the ECB mean by the word “durably” to describe inflation in relation to its 2 per cent target and what kind of timescale should people understand you to mean for inflation to be moderately above target in order for you to fulfil the criteria to meet your target?   So you asked two questions there. Right now, in our December forecast, we’re looking at 2022, we’re looking at 2023 and we’re looking at 2024. Now, why do we look at these three years? Because monetary policy essentially works over a 18 month / two-year horizon. So any monetary policy move we take today would mostly show up in the inflation data in 2023 and 2024. Less so in 2022, because inflation takes a while to respond to monetary policy. So “durably” means it would be essentially a mistake to respond to inflation that’s high in 2022 but below target in 2023 and 2024. And that is essentially the notion of durability: unless we think the inflation pressure is going to remain above 2 per cent in 2023 and 2024, it would be a mistake to tighten policy in response to inflation that’s high right now. In terms of the second question, you’ll have to remind me of the second question.  How long would inflation need to be moderately above target?   So moderately above target is a very important concept. And essentially what we need to look at is: is there any sign of today’s high inflation becoming embedded in expectations? Because, of course, if people expect the inflation rate of 3.2 per cent in 2022 to persist in 2023, 2024 and beyond, then it may change pricing behaviour, wage behaviour in a self-fulfilling way. So that is really the criterion: are we seeing inflation, persistent inflation, being converted into actions, into new types of wage-setting behaviour, price-setting behaviour? And so, if inflation is temporarily above target, people understand it’s not going to last. That’s very different to if inflation – let’s say, the 3.2 number we have today. If that 3.2 number is expected to repeat, that would be a problem. But what we don’t see is evidence of that. What we see is not just our own forecast, but the behaviour of consumers, the behaviour of firms, the financial markets. All agree with us in the sense of believing that, more likely than not, inflation in 2023, 2024 will be below our target, not above our target.   House prices have accelerated sharply across the euro area countries, including Ireland. Do you accept, as some people have said, that part of the reason may be an unintended side effect of loose monetary policy?   So let me emphasise – I think you have a fair characterisation of the issue there – certainly monetary policy is one factor in the housing market. But even there, let me emphasise: it’s on both sides. So, low interest rates help to finance construction, it helps to repair the supply deficiency that we see in so many parts of Europe. There is a lack of construction activity. So low interest rates are part of the supply-side mechanism. On the other hand, low interest rates are also on the demand side. And this is why it’s so important that other supply policies are implemented. And also on the demand side, it is so important that countries have robust macroprudential frameworks. Ireland has this with the mortgage rules, but there’s a more general move across Europe to make sure that countries recognise that monetary policy on its own cannot be expected to manage the risks in the housing market. We also need broader macroprudential policies, which more and more countries are rolling out, including here.   I suppose for most people, when they think about monetary policy and they think about inflation, they actually just want to know “look, are interest rates going to go up or not?” At the last Governing Council meeting, the President of the ECB reiterated yet again that it was highly unlikely that interest rates may change this year, in 2022. Is that still the case?   Yes, that remains the case. We went through this comprehensive assessment in December. And again, to repeat, we do think inflation in 2022 will be temporarily above our target. But we do think inflation is going to come down below our target in 2023 and 2024. We try to be super clear about the criteria we use in making interest rate decisions and, going over what we talked about, when we think the high inflation is not going to be durable, the case for altering our interest rate policy is not there. But, of course, let me repeat: we will have new data coming in all year long. And you can expect the ECB to be paying a lot of attention to all of that data. And again, it’s data about what’s happening this year. It’s also data about the future. I mean: are we seeing changes in labour markets? Are we seeing changes in energy markets, in goods markets? So it’s always two-sided. One focus is on what’s happening right now. The other one is trying to get a little bit of a crystal ball answer and work out: are there structural changes in the economy that might affect our views about the later years? But right now, going back to what I said earlier on, one of the big issues for us this year is: what’s happening in terms of wage behaviour. We do expect wages to pick up; that reflects – quite – the fact that the labour market has been more resilient in the pandemic, thanks of course to extensive government supports many labour markets. And if we have a stronger labour market in the coming years, then we should have stronger wage behaviours than before the pandemic. So, to some extent, that’s going to be what we want. But of course, we have to keep an eye out on whether wages will move beyond that and move into the kind of second-round effect, which would be something of a concern.   "
2021-12-22,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Le Monde  ,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert on 16 December and published on 22 December","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Monde    Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert on 16 December and published on 22 December 22 December 2021  With the very rapid economic recovery on the one hand and the new wave of the pandemic on the other, the economic situation is hard to read. What’s your view?  Uncertainty is very high, as it has been throughout the pandemic. In general, I think the recovery continues. But owing to the recent wave of infections and the new variant, we are seeing headwinds in the short term. Now we’re looking at a weaker fourth quarter and this is likely to spill over to the beginning of next year. However, we expect a stronger rebound thereafter, so activity essentially shifts over time. This has been a recurring pattern during the pandemic. Households in the euro area have accumulated considerable savings, which supports the recovery. Hence, we see the recovery as being delayed rather than derailed.  Inflation has reached 4.9% in the euro area, 6% in Germany and over 9% in some of the Baltic countries. Are you worried?  Those high numbers are related to the specific situation of the pandemic. When the economy reopened, there was a strong rebound in demand. Supply couldn’t meet that demand quickly enough, partly because of health-related restrictions. That led to numerous supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices, in particular energy prices. This has been amplified by a number of statistical effects, stemming from the fact that we’re comparing prices today with very low prices one year ago, in the middle of the pandemic, when they had collapsed. That distorts the picture somewhat.  All those factors are likely to either reverse or at least become less pronounced over the coming year. Take supply bottlenecks: we don’t know how quickly it will happen, but it’s clear that over time they will be resolved. Similarly, it’s highly unlikely that energy prices will continue to go up at the same speed. And lastly, base effects will disappear. We know that inflation is going to be elevated for a certain period of time, but also that it’s going to decline over the course of next year. We are less certain about how fast and how strong the decline will be.   We’ve been hearing this explanation about transitory inflation since last summer. But month after month, it always surprises on the upside…  Most economists hadn’t expected the extent of the increase in inflation. That’s why we are increasingly relying on surveys of companies and households to better understand what is happening. Some companies are telling us they expect the supply chain bottlenecks to last into 2023. We are well aware of the uncertainty around our inflation projections. There is a risk to the upside. Another factor that plays a central role is wage developments. Current data point to moderate growth. However, we also learned from our survey among companies that they expect wage growth to pick up. It’s something we are monitoring very closely.  Officially, after inflation of 3.2% in 2022, you are projecting 1.8% in 2023. Is that still credible?  Our staff are using the best economic models available in order to make these projections. But everybody agrees that uncertainty is unusually high. One of the trickiest questions is whether the economy is undergoing some fundamental structural changes that are not yet reflected in the models. Are we going to go back to the disinflationary environment that we had before the pandemic? Or are we entering a new phase that may be characterised by inflationary rather than disinflationary shocks?  And what’s the answer to that question?  Take climate change as an example. Previously, when oil prices were going up, shale oil producers quickly increased their levels of production, which put downward pressure on prices. That is not happening to the same degree now. This can probably be explained by the fact that, owing to the green transition, there is less incentive to invest in shale oil facilities. If that’s true, we are perhaps going to see stronger upward trends in oil prices in the future.  Are we therefore entering a “new normal”?  This remains to be seen. We should follow a risk management approach so that we can quickly respond should we see signs that inflation will stay more permanently at a level above our 2% target.  Despite these uncertainties, and the risk of higher inflation, the ECB only announced a very gradual withdrawal of its asset purchases, from the current rate of €90 billion per month to €40 billion from April, then €30 billion in the third quarter of 2022 and €20 billion in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to say that this is a very accommodative stance?  We have taken an important step towards the normalisation of our monetary policy. This has to be a gradual process – it can’t happen all at once. If we responded too quickly, there would be a risk of choking the recovery by tightening financing conditions too abruptly. We are taking a step-by-step approach to normalisation, the pace of which can be adjusted to the incoming data. We need to retain optionality to make sure that we sustainably reach our 2% target.  Nevertheless, the ECB has been carrying out asset purchases for six years now, the interest rate is -0.5% and normalisation of monetary policy has been pushed back several times. How will you achieve it this time?  The reason why our policies have been accommodative for so long is that inflation was stubbornly low. Despite all the measures we have taken, it has been hard to get medium-term inflation back towards the 2% target. Over the past year, however, we have made substantial progress, and it seems we are on the right path to achieving our target in a more sustainable manner. This is a precondition for policy normalisation.  And yet, on the contrary, the impression is that the ECB has had to do more and more every time, and that its measures are less effective every time, that more billions are always needed…  Because the interest rates were already very low, we had to use new tools, which have proven highly effective. But the effectiveness of some instruments diminishes over time. We have already bought a lot of bonds, and the balance of the benefits and costs of additional bond purchases deteriorates as the economy gains ground. This is why we slow down purchases now. But given the prevailing uncertainties, this has to be gradual, also with a view to ensuring the smooth transmission of our policy across the entire euro area.  In this context, is it possible to imagine a return to a “normal” monetary policy – say a 0% interest rate – during your mandate (which comes to an end in 2028)?  I hope so. The developments over the past year give reason for cautious optimism. Before the pandemic, we were in an environment of relatively low growth and too low inflation for many years. But now we are seeing that inflation is picking up and inflation expectations are realigning with our target of 2%. This is precisely what can help us get out of the low growth, low inflation environment and back to a more normal world.   "
2021-12-07,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Che Tempo Che Fa,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Fabio Fazio on 28 November and published on 7 December 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Che Tempo Che Fa   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Fabio Fazio on 28 November and published on 7 December 2021 7 December 2021  Thank you very much for accepting our invitation. It is a real privilege. You were the first woman to lead the International Monetary Fund. Before that, you were at the head of a very large international law firm, then the first female finance minister of a G7 country. According to Forbes, you are one of the most powerful and influential women in the world. But I have found out that your life was already full of records and success when you were young: you were in the French national synchronised swimming team. Is there a connection between what sport taught you and your life?   First of all, let me say that I am delighted to be here with you and to be on this programme that is so renowned in Italy, and that I am quite simply happy to be in Italy.  The connection between sport and the different jobs I’ve done is very clear to me: I think that sport, especially when practised at an international competition level, teaches you to work, because you have to train a lot, you have to do a lot of lengths in the swimming pool to be at a good level. It teaches you about competition, it teaches you injustice, because when you do synchronised swimming sometimes the marks are very unfair, and you rebel. But you have to accept the injustice and overcome it. And then it also teaches you a lot about teamwork. Because synchronised swimming is a team sport and you have to “pull” for yourself but also for the others. When you are performing a routine and the whole team is underwater and you are helping them, there is no other answer. The team has to win.   Yes, absolutely. Sport and teamwork are a metaphor, really a typical example. Now I’d like to talk about today, the present time. We have understood more than ever, during this pandemic, and as popular wisdom says, that health is more important than the economy and finance. What has this global shock taught us, all of us and people in positions such as yours? And how is this economic crisis different from the one you already faced in 2008?  The pandemic taught us first that we are all interdependent. That is, if we are not all protected, all vaccinated, we will all be in danger. The collective imperative is therefore clear. I think the second lesson we learned from the COVID-19 crisis was that we had to put people before the economy, before the financial situation. And these are choices that were made deliberately by politicians, by those who took the decisions at the time. It consisted of saying “We must maintain wages, preserve income, protect firms during this terrible epidemiological crisis”. That was the real difference compared with the 2008 financial crisis, which I also experienced: in 2008, we started by trying to save the financial system to avoid losing deposits.   Yes, but in Europe inflation rose in October, if I am not mistaken, to a little more than 4%. In Germany, it exceeded 5%. In Italy, it is 3% and, in the United States, inflation was even over 6%. So there is quite a bit of anxiety, but you have always said that it is a passing phenomenon. Do you still think so? Can you reassure us?   Yes, I think that the inflation we are experiencing today comes essentially from passing phenomena. The first and most important one, which Italy in particular is experiencing, is a phenomenon linked to energy prices. Today the increase in prices in Italy can be explained at around 69% by energy prices. And the energy prices are determined of course by significant demand, but also by geopolitical problems, climatological problems, and very specific problems linked to the maintenance of wind turbine farms, a drop in sales during a certain period, and the substitution of wind energy by gas, which was suddenly in very high demand. It can seem a bit complicated, but all these phenomena show that it is not in fact a question of long-term structural factors. So we are fairly certain that these phenomena will disappear.   Can I ask you when? When do you think these phenomena will go away?  We will see significant changes in 2022 because of base effects, since we are comparing the prices in one year with the prices in the year before. So, when these base effects disappear, inflation will slow down. The second element is the meeting of demand and supply. What have we seen so far? We have seen that after the pandemic period when people stayed at home, and couldn’t consume, there was what we call “catch-up” demand. All of a sudden, people wanted to buy things, to have access to services, to take holidays that they hadn’t been able to take previously. And, in the face of this catch-up demand, the offer hadn’t grown in the same proportions. And that’s why today we don’t have enough containers, ships, unloading capacity in ports, trucks and truck drivers to transport the goods. But this economic phenomenon will also fade away because demand and supply will readjust. We won’t forever be making up for the opportunities that we didn’t have during the pandemic period.   Madame Lagarde, the European Central Bank has fixed the inflation target at 2%. Can you explain to us why 2%?  I’m going to try to tell you this simply because it’s not easy. First of all, it should be noted that all the central banks in the world have defined price stability as being inflation at around 2%. In Europe, we decided that we had to be clear, precise, and we said that the inflation target was 2%. It’s not around 2%, it’s 2%. So why 2%? First, because the different countries in the European Union move forward at different rates. As you mentioned, Germany has a higher rate of inflation than Italy at the moment. Having an average rate like that allows us to rebalance things a bit. Second, in times of crisis, we need to have some room for manoeuvre to be able to respond. Well, if the increase in prices was always at 0%, we would have no room for manoeuvre at all. And we central bankers would have no tools to respond to the crisis and to help economies recover. And third, we know very well that price observation is not perfect, and that in order to correct this imperfection we need room for manoeuvre. The fourth reason is one that was often invoked by Alan Greenspan, the great American central banker, who is no longer in office, but who used to say “Up to 2%, in fact we don’t really notice that prices are rising”. And lastly, this 2% level also gives the unions a bit of leeway to negotiate wage increases. These are all the reasons why, worldwide, price stability is defined as an increase in prices of 2%.   Still on this point, as regards the European Central Bank’s policy. At the time you became President of the ECB, economists were certain that its expansionary monetary policy had already reached its limits. You said, by contrast, that such a policy has no limits. Can you confirm this? Is this still the case today?  In March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic shook us all and really damaged economies, we decided that we had to act decisively and reaffirm our unlimited commitment to the euro. Why? Because, first of all, it is the mission of the European Central Bank to be the guardian of the euro and to ensure that monetary policy is well transmitted throughout the euro area. It is the ECB’s responsibility to guarantee price stability and therefore to support the economy when it collapses. That’s how, at that time, we put in place an exceptional programme, our pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP, which was effectively unlimited. And so far we have pledged €1,500 billion to support the economy, in order to enable the transmission of monetary policy throughout the whole euro area and to maintain price stability.   Madame Lagarde, I’d like to know your thoughts on the following question. Western countries have spent around USD 6,000 billion of fiscal support. But why is the international community unable to bring together USD 50 billion to ensure vaccination in low income countries, where only 2% of the population is vaccinated? Why can we find USD 6,000 billion of fiscal support, but not 50 billion to fight against a virus that is today returning from Africa in a new form? Isn’t it a sin of naivety on one side, as well as pride and selfishness?   I think that we understood during this crisis that a variant that develops in Botswana and that is discovered in South Africa can reach the Netherlands, France, Italy, Belgium and Hong Kong in the space of a few hours. This virus has no borders, which confirms the principle that I mentioned earlier: we will not be protected until we are all vaccinated. Vaccination is a battle I know you are fighting in Italy, and I admire you greatly for that. Fortunately, the G20 held in Rome under the Italian presidency, about a month ago, agreed on the principle of vaccinating, in all the countries of the world, 30% of the population by the end of 2021 and 70% by mid-2022. These are commitments that we will have to monitor very closely to ensure that they are followed through. It is not enough to say that “We’ll do it”, the €50 billion, which are a drop in the ocean compared with the fiscal and budget support that has been put in place, need to be allocated. We have to ensure the logistics, the implementation. We have to ensure that, once the vaccines have been delivered to their destination, in each country, the vaccinations are done. And we have to go further. In some of these countries, we need to set up analysis centres to be able detect changes in the virus as quickly as possible and respond with vaccines.   Of course, there really is this physical problem of the last kilometre. We have to reach the most remote places.   We can transport packages with large distribution companies up to the last kilometre, perhaps we can do it with the vaccine.   Yes, absolutely. It is good to hear you say that. It’s reassuring. And the good news is that the EU’s response to the pandemic was immediate and unified from the outset. But the EU has been very strict over the years on exceeding parameters: 0.1% was already the end of the world, even after the Greek crisis. So what happened? Who suddenly allowed this change of course?   You know, I think there was a collective realisation that we were all in this boat called Europe together. And that we could not respond to such a tragedy in a national, selfish and rigid way. It pains me to say it, but I think that what happened in the north of Italy at the end of February and the beginning of March 2020, which we saw on our screens across Europe, was a determining factor in raising public awareness, which had previously been limited. The images of the tragedy in the Bergamo region, for example, in northern Italy, were an almost immediate wake-up call. And I believe that there was then the wisdom of certain European leaders – I am thinking of Angela Merkel in particular – who also understood that all the countries of Europe, not only those who were suffering, had to respond together.   Do you expect that Germany’s stance on your expansive monetary policy will become slightly more critical once Chancellor Merkel’s term in office comes to an end?  I don't want to prejudge what the next German Government will be, but one thing I can see is that German leaders – and I'm not talking about the press or about public opinion, I'm talking about German leaders – have always been very respectful of the ECB’s independence. It was the same during the time of my renowned predecessor Mario Draghi. There was a working relationship between him and the leaders, including the German leaders, which I have had the honour of being able to continue, and this independence has been preserved.   Are you concerned about the increase in infections, in relation to the economic recovery in Europe?  I don’t think that 2021 will be affected by the measures that we are starting to see here and there. It is obviously a risk for the conditions of next year's recovery, however. Today I think that we have still learned a lot and that we know our enemy better. We know what tools we need and we know what precautions we need to take. A large majority of our populations have been vaccinated and treatments are starting to emerge. People know that they need to take precautions and that the responsibility lies with each and every one of us. And I think we are better equipped to respond to the risk of a fifth wave or the Omicron variant.   In your opinion, is it science fiction to consider, beyond European monetary policy, a common fiscal policy?  I’d like to tell you what happened with the ""Next Generation EU"" package. When it was agreed in July 2020, it was an incredible signal of a collective response, of a European determination and of the will to compensate the sacrifices and the suffering experienced by certain countries through collective generosity. That’s why I think that we all have a very strong responsibility – Italians, French, all Europeans – to implement this plan properly. To carry out reforms, to invest in greening the economy and in the digital economy, to prove to those who might be a little cynical, a little sceptical, that Europeans can not only decide together, but deliver together. And I am very hopeful that this message will be received and that it will be implemented.   And yet, Madame Lagarde, Europe cannot be reduced to a simple common market. It also represents shared values and shared rights, the most important of which originated in France. But what we are currently witnessing between Poland and Belarus appears to be a total denial of the fundamental rights on which the EU is founded.  It is obvious that the foundations of Europe, which are based on the rule of law and the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights, must prevail over egoism and the stratagems adopted by some to impose their political positions. And I hope that together, Europeans will be able to provide a response, and in particular to show solidarity with Poland in order to respond to the tragedy unfolding at the border in a humanitarian way.   Pope Francis, who I would say is a great and compassionate intellectual, called for a profound change in how the economic system works. He said that it is time to put people, their dignity and their needs back at the centre and the economy at the service of the people, not the other way around. What changes do you think would be possible, and not just desirable? Are there things that we can concretely change?  I am very receptive to the Pope’s message, because I have a lot of admiration for the intellectual force of Pope Francis and I have had the opportunity to discuss with him, during several conversations, the need to put people back at the heart of the system, to put finance at the service of the economy and to centre the economy around people. It's through action that we can demonstrate our desire for change. I believe that if all countries develop a joint response to the pandemic in the poorest countries, in the countries of Africa, to ensure that everyone has access to vaccination and treatments, as we fought to do with AIDS in particular, if we manage to demonstrate this collectively and generously, it will be a small act that will show that we are more concerned about the fate of mankind than about the royalties that go into the patent owners’ coffers. I say this intentionally, because I know that today the debate is raging at the WTO, where facilitating vaccination through patent waivers is currently under much discussion and fraught with difficulty, and I hope that it will succeed.   President Biden has expressed similar views, which is a major encouragement. Turning to Italy: we were surprised when Standard & Poor’s raised the country’s outlook from stable to positive. What reasons do you see for this decision to increase the rating?  But there can be some good news! I think the economic results we are seeing now speak for themselves. Italy suffered deeply from the pandemic. It was one of the most affected countries in Europe, with its economy contracting by 9%. Today it is on course for growth of over 6%, with figures quoted at 6.5% or even 6.6%. This is very clearly a strong response to the crisis. And now, reforms have been agreed in the form of legislative texts that will have to be developed, implemented and enforced. I believe these reforms are of a kind to convince the rating agencies that Italy is on the right track.  Madame Lagarde, last Thursday was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. You have always been committed to fighting gender inequality, but for every successful woman, there are countless others who, while deserving of success, will never achieve it. In banks and across the world, only 3% of CEOs are women. Things are slightly better in Europe, but women still account for less than 9%. What can we do concretely? Are legally binding quotas like those set in some countries a good solution? Is a different approach needed, or does the cultural crisis come first?  This is one of the solutions, but there must be multiple lines of action. We need to put in place systems that allow families to have children and enable women to do their work and continue working if they can. Men must support women who want to engage in working life and family tasks must be borne equally by fathers and mothers, by men and women. Maternity leave and parental leave must be made available and on equal terms for men and women. Of course, school and university support for women must be put in place. At the ECB we have set up scholarships to enable young women who wish to pursue economic studies to do so under good financial conditions. Firms and banks can also do this. They must do this. And these things have to be measured, because if we don't measure them, either with quotas or with targets, we won't achieve the result we want. It is well known that what is not measured is not done. So we have to be committed, carry out checks and go into the details of the figures. You can't just say “we'll have 50% women”, because invariably we have 80% of women in the lower-ranking jobs and 3% in the top jobs. You always have to make sure, at every stage, that actions are measured.   Before we finish I would like to remind viewers that you will be in Turin tomorrow evening to speak at a conference organised by the Collegio Carlo Alberto, the Fondazione Agnelli and the Accademia dei Lincei. On this topic, our President, Sergio Mattarella, called on people to fight against anti-science. That is why you will be there tomorrow. But I would like to ask you one last question, out of curiosity. You were once asked what had helped you most in your professional rise, and you said “love”. In what way? What type of love?  First of all, it's love in the broadest sense. That is to say, it's the love of the family, the love of a partner, the love of one's children, the love of one's friends. It's this current of affection, tenderness and trust which is given to you, and I think that when you have this love, as I was lucky enough to have, you gain in confidence. You are more prepared to take risks, you have fewer doubts. Because you know that if you take a risk, if you fall, if you fail, there will always be someone who loves you enough, who will take you by the hand and help you to go to the next step. So that's why I think you need a little ambition and a lot of work, energy and confidence to succeed. But confidence can only be built on love. So that's why I think that love is very important. It’s been important for me.  Thank you for joining us, Madame Lagarde.     "
2021-11-30,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Les Echos ,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Guillaume Benoit, Édouard Lederer and Thibaut Madelin on 24 November and published on 30 November","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Les Echos    Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Guillaume Benoit, Édouard Lederer and Thibaut Madelin on 24 November and published on 30 November 30 November 2021  Banks are posting record profits and giving the impression that the crisis is over. Is that an illusion or reality?  European banks have performed fairly well recently. Since the pandemic, profitability has increased, but the main driver of this increase is the drop in provisions. This performance is therefore based on an optimistic scenario in which the recovery continues and there is no large wave of insolvencies. However, it is good to be very cautious, because once the government support measures are withdrawn, insolvencies and non-performing loans will increase.  Do you recommend that banks don’t release their provisions?  It’s something that should be assessed on a bank-by-bank basis. My recommendation would be to be cautious, because we don’t know what the ultimate impact of the pandemic will be, or what effect the withdrawal of support will have. That also holds true for dividends and remuneration policies. As supervisors and given our responsibility for financial stability, our role is to call for caution.  You are concerned about a correction in property prices. Could we say there is a bubble?  There is no definition of “bubble”. You know there is a bubble when it bursts. Our message is very clear: in the housing market, there are clearly pockets of overvaluation that go beyond the fundamentals. And this trend continued throughout the pandemic. Up until now, it was a localised phenomenon, but it is becoming increasingly widespread throughout the euro area. We must monitor it closely, as it comes against a backdrop of low interest rates.  What can you do to curb this trend?  The countercyclical capital buffers were released during the public health crisis to maintain the flow of credit. Now, the macroprudential authorities in some countries should start considering the possibility of increasing them again in order to increase banks’ resilience and temper the growth in housing loans, and thereby ensure there is a soft landing if the cycle turns.  Along with Germany and the Netherlands, France was highlighted in your financial stability review. Should France implement this measure?  I’m not thinking about any country in particular. But the European Systemic Risk Board will issue country-by-country recommendations in the near future.  Financial markets are also showing signs of exuberance. Should we be afraid of another accident like the Archegos collapse, which caused banks to lose 10 billion dollars?  The environment of very low interest rates has a greater impact on the risk appetite of non-banks than it does on that of banks. And these financial intermediaries are becoming increasingly important, including in Europe. To improve the returns of their portfolios, they invest in less liquid securities, and often accumulate debt to do so. The combination of this leverage effect and less liquid securities as well as riskier assets should give us cause to be vigilant. But regulation is weaker in this sector. As for banks, their levels of capital and liquidity have increased significantly since the financial crisis. But hedge funds and other investment funds are interconnected with banks and can have a system-wide impact. Archegos could be the canary in the coal mine.  Bank balance sheets have grown substantially during the crisis. This is the opposite of the “too big to fail” syndrome we wanted to combat after the financial crisis. Is this a cause for concern?  That’s correct. There has been a strong increase in bank lending. In France, the increased indebtedness of companies was accompanied by the increased accumulation of cash. So the increase in net indebtedness is actually very limited. What is important is that bank capital ratios remained stable, and asset quality improved. That’s why I’m concentrating on provisions.  The current wave of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) will soon draw to a close. Might the ECB extend this instrument?   The TLTROs are not finished yet. I think they have been a very useful instrument during the pandemic for providing short and medium-term liquidity to banks, but there is no urgency to decide on their renewal. We can wait a little longer; it’s not going to be a decision we discuss in December.   Does that imply that banks are still in need of support ?   The TLTROs are part of an emergency programme in response to the pandemic. Now that the situation is improving, the pandemic has left scars that need to be taken into consideration. Let’s not forget that TLTROs are not repaid on a fixed date but that there can be several repayment windows. So there will not be a cliff effect, and the repayment will be spread over time.   The new “Omicron” variant is emerging as parts of Europe are being hit by a fifth wave of COVID-19. Does this worry you?   Indeed, we have more bad news about the virus and are observing the situation of this new Omicron variant closely. The incidence rate in Germany is clearly on the rise and we have seen lockdowns reintroduced in Austria and Slovakia. It’s always unfortunate. But the situation is different from that in 2020. First and foremost, we now have vaccination. The vaccination rates in Spain and Italy, for example, are very high, in the region of 90%. Infection rates are highest in countries with lower vaccination levels of around 60-70%. Moreover, a policy of booster jabs is gaining ground, as is the requirement for a health passport. And the economic impact of a lockdown is no longer the same either, because the economy has now adapted to the situation.   Turning to payments, is the European Payment Initiative important in your view?   The banking union is key for establishing a truly European payment system. But it’s also essential to have a truly integrated interbank payment system, in terms of technological solutions and in terms of costs. Our approach is to support this initiative.   What will the success of this project depend on?   Such a system would have to be customer-friendly and efficient. The system should also be completely open to other banks wishing to join the project, not only in the euro area but in Europe as a whole. Of course, it could start with a limited number of countries in the initial phase, and we hope that this initiative can expand in the future.   Is it time to more strictly regulate the world of crypto-assets ?   The development of this market is rather impressive. I personally think that it will continue to expand rapidly. Up to now, the volatility that we have seen has not had an impact on financial stability. But at this pace of growth, we have to pay attention to it − especially in relation to issues such as terrorism financing and tax evasion. Above all, we have not yet focused enough on the combination of two risks: the acquisition of crypto-assets with leverage, in other words with debt. A market that is growing so quickly, combined with a leverage effect, generates stronger and more systemic connections with the rest of the financial system.   Are big tech firms also a source of concern?   Our basic principle is very simple: same activity, same regulation. If you grant loans, you should be regulated like a bank is. In terms of financial stability, however, I find these players much less worrying than the world of crypto-assets. Because the tech giants are large corporations with high market capitalisation and with a capacity for dialogue…   Are you still calling for banking consolidation in Europe?   I don’t think there has been cross-border consolidation. Any operations that we could see were on a much smaller scale. This is linked to the banking union, which has still not been finalised. We should welcome the incoming German government’s inclusion of this point in its programme. Once banking union has been achieved, we will have a common deposit guarantee scheme in addition to single supervision and a single banking resolution mechanism. I expect that consolidation will then play a more prominent role.   You recently said that certain inflation factors in Europe were becoming more structural, and therefore permanent. What are they?  The outlook for price developments isn’t entirely clear. What is certain is that the factors behind the high rate of inflation we’re experiencing will not last, and we should see them fade next year. But what I’d first like to draw attention to is that we underestimated inflation developments in 2021. Not only the ECB, but all forecasters. The European Commission published its economic projections two weeks ago, and revised inflation figures upwards. Why? Because the base effects linked to supply problems and energy costs were stronger than we envisaged. In 2022, bottlenecks may last longer than expected. As a result, there’s a risk that inflation will not go down as quickly and as much as we predicted.  Could inflation become uncontrollable?  Amid the current uncertainty, it’s crucial to look at inflation expectations, to see what level they will settle at. For the time being, they’re a little below our inflation target of 2%, which is largely reassuring. But we need to remain vigilant to avoid second-round effects via wages. In that case, the upward inflationary trend could be more long-lasting. We haven’t seen any such effects yet. However, it should be noted that owing to the pandemic, most wage negotiations have been postponed to the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. So we should be very careful.  The markets have the impression that the next ECB meeting will signal a tightening of monetary policy. Is that the case?  What we will do is adjust our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) to the dynamics of inflation, to our economic forecasts and to the changing health situation. The programme was designed to deal with the consequences of the pandemic. Despite the recent rise in infections, COVID-19 will eventually fade away. But we will not go ahead with tapering (phasing out purchases), as the US Federal Reserve has done. The President of the ECB has announced that net purchases will end in March. But they could be resumed if necessary.  And after the PEPP has ended?  From a personal perspective, I think that monetary policy must remain accommodative after the PEPP has ended, because some of the scars left by the pandemic haven’t properly healed yet. Even if we have returned to pre-crisis levels of production and income. We must therefore keep our monetary policy accommodative, although not to the extent that we did at the height of the crisis in order to meet our medium-term inflation objective, and be even more driven by economic data.  Does that mean that an increase in the ECB’s key interest rates, which some market participants envisage happening by the end of 2022, isn’t a credible scenario?  We haven’t discussed that yet, but I’ll give you my personal opinion. If we look at our forward guidance (note: the ECB’s tool for steering market expectations) we have two main instruments: asset purchases and key interest rates. And we make it clear that we will start increasing our rates shortly after we have ended our net asset purchases. I’m confident that those net purchases will continue throughout next year. Beyond that, I don’t know.   "
2021-11-29,Isabel Schnabel,TV interview with ZDF Morgenmagazin,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Mitri Sirin on 29 November 2021","   INTERVIEW  TV interview with ZDF Morgenmagazin   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Mitri Sirin on 29 November 2021 29 November 2021  Producer prices, which are an indicator of inflation, grew by 18.4 per cent within a single month. This was the steepest rise since the 1950s. What do you make of that?  I can see why many people are currently worried about very high inflation rates. We have all been seeing prices go up all around us – whether while buying bread or paying our heating bill. But we need to understand that it has to do with the very unusual situation the economy is in because of the pandemic. After the lockdowns, the economy restarted surprisingly quickly, demand rose and firms could no longer keep up. This is why we are seeing supply bottlenecks and shortages. This affects commodities, mostly energy, and input products such as microchips. There are also one-off statistical effects at play – inflation rates are high now because prices were exceptionally low a year ago. In other words, we are comparing today’s prices with the very low prices at the height of the pandemic. But if we look at the comparison with the prices before the pandemic, so over the past two years, the average inflation rate for Germany is only around 2%.  It was initially thought, also by the ECB, that this had all to do with the one-off effects from the coronavirus. That view may now have changed. The inflation rate was 4.5% in October and is expected to rise to 6% in November. How much longer is it going to last, in your opinion?  Many people were not expecting prices to increase to this extent. But we believe that the inflation rate will peak in November and gradually subside next year, towards our inflation target of 2%. Indeed, most forecasts expect inflation to fall even below that 2% level. So there is no indication that inflation is getting out of control.  Let me sum up. As you said at the start, we have shortages of commodities and of workers, severe supply bottlenecks and then there’s also this powerful inflation. Everything is coming at us at the same time. So what does this actually mean for consumers? Will this now keep spiralling, perhaps without governments intervening?   You have to realise that the supply bottlenecks will gradually ease. Energy prices, too, will not keep increasing as rapidly and the one-off statistical effects will progressively drop out of the calculations. That means that inflation developments will not continue at the same pace. You also have to remember that the ECB is committed to the objective of price stability. So if we see that inflation could persistently remain at a level above 2%, we will of course respond decisively. At present, however, we are not yet seeing such indications.  How do you intend to respond?  We have the toolkit to tighten monetary policy, of course. But at the moment it would be a mistake to raise interest rates prematurely and thus put a brake on the recovery. That would essentially result in higher unemployment and would not have any impact on the current extremely high rate of inflation.   Producer prices, which have recently soared, are a major problem. We’ve touched on commodities prices. When do you think these prices will fall again? Because that is basically the only thing that consumers are interested in right now.   The degree of uncertainty is indeed significant. What we hear is that firms also assume that these bottlenecks will persist for longer than originally thought. Some sectors even expect that they will last well into next year. But all in all, this will recede. We don’t know exactly how fast. There is a lot of uncertainty about it but the consensus is that these large price increases will not last.  It will of course have to fall back at some point but I think we will need to stick it out for a little longer. That’s how it sounds to me. ECB Executive Board member Professor Schnabel, many thanks. The Federal Statistical Office is today publishing the new rate of inflation for November. Many thanks and have a good day.   Thank you very much for this conversation.    "
2021-11-26,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Gerald Braunberger, Dennis Kremer and Christian Siedenbiedel on 23 November and published on 26 November 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Gerald Braunberger, Dennis Kremer and Christian Siedenbiedel on 23 November and published on 26 November 2021 26 November 2021  Madame Lagarde, inflation rates are increasing around the world. Inflation in the United States is 6.2%, while in Germany a rate of close to 6% is expected for November. Is inflation spiralling out of control?   At the European Central Bank we are of course monitoring that very closely. And not only because our primary objective is maintaining price stability and inflation is a crucial indicator of that. But also because we know that inflation affects people. Those who are less privileged and less well off are the ones who suffer the most from inflation. That’s why we need to keep looking at it very carefully.   Do you feel any effects of rising inflation in your own daily life?  Of course, the rise in energy prices is the most noticeable. After all, energy price inflation now accounts for around half of the high inflation rates. You can’t help noticing the price increase when you fill up your tank at a petrol station or buy heating oil for the winter. As a French person, I keep a close eye on the prices for good bread at the bakery. That stands out at the moment and is making many people worried – but we expect that this rise in inflation will not last. It will subside next year. We expect that the inflation rates will start to fall from as early as January.  What makes you so sure? Won’t there be second-round effects, if the trade unions demand higher wages to compensate for the higher prices?   Judging by what we know from surveys of employers and trade unions so far, no strong inflationary pressure is to be expected from that front for the time being. The negotiated wage settlements have been very moderate so far. For next year, somewhat higher wage demands are partly to be expected. But based on what we are seeing, the settlements should not be on a scale that might trigger a wage-price spiral.  Do you not think that employees could become nervous and nonetheless demand compensation for inflation if inflation rates now hit a level that has not been seen for many years?   That does not seem to be the case at the moment. And if we look at inflation expectations, both those which can be derived from the financial markets and those resulting from surveys, then most people do not expect higher inflation in the longer term. Inflation expectations have risen, but they are below our inflation target of 2%. We don’t see any de-anchoring of inflation expectations.   Do you personally never have any doubts that inflation might persist for longer than your experts are currently predicting?   I ask myself this question again and again. To answer it you have to consider what is driving the current high rates of inflation. I would distinguish three groups of driving factors. The first are statistical base effects which are related to the pandemic, such as the VAT reduction in Germany last year and its reversal, which are now sharply pushing up the price increase relative to the previous year. Similar passing pandemic effects can be seen in respect of package holidays, for example. These factors will automatically disappear next year, as they will fall out of the year-on-year comparison. Supply bottlenecks are a second group of drivers. Demand surged after the end of the first lockdown whereas supply is still constrained. These bottlenecks in, say, computer chips, containers and road haulage capacity are obviously persisting for longer than we had initially thought. But the situation will gradually improve next year in that respect too. The third group is energy prices. We expect that energy price developments will at least stabilise next year.   But surely nobody can know for certain how oil prices, say, will develop next year?  We at least see good reasons why the strong price increase in energy will not last into the second half of 2022. There is in any case no expectation in the oil futures markets that the price increase will continue. But we are seeking to evaluate and consider as many sources of information on this topic as we can.   Do you understand the special concerns in Germany about the high inflation rates?   Yes, I understand these concerns very well; inflation in Germany is higher than in some other countries – in Italy or France for example. In addition, there are cultural differences and a special history with inflation in Germany in the 1920s. The collective experience of inflation in Germany is a different one to that of France or Italy. I understand all that. That’s why we have to thoroughly explain why we nonetheless think our strategy is correct and that we are following price developments very carefully.  Many people in Germany have long been calling for signs that the ECB will tighten its monetary policy strategy.   If we were to tighten monetary policy now, we would expect it to have an impact in 18 months. That is the extent of the time lag before our monetary policy measures take effect. According to our forecasts, however, inflation would have fallen back again by then. We would cause unemployment and high adjustment costs and would nonetheless not have countered the current high level of inflation. I would find that wrong.  Prominent economists like Charles Goodhart think that the whole world is about to enter an era of higher inflation. Does that not worry you?  It goes without saying that we think about longer-term inflation developments. The issue is whether factors which have so far dampened inflation, such as demographic developments or globalisation, are now reversing and could lead to higher rates of inflation. There could be changes; after the pandemic firms may think differently about globalisation and relocating production to cheaper countries. Globalisation will change, but it will proceed and will in all likelihood continue to temper inflation.   But many firms have been talking about deglobalisation since the outbreak of the pandemic.  People have been talking about that for around a year, but it is not really observable in practice. The incentive for firms to cut costs will remain stronger than their desire for independence from suppliers and control over the supply chains. I don’t see any sustainable price-increasing development. By contrast, in my estimation, the changes in demographic developments could have an impact on the future path of inflation, as indeed could digitalisation. But all in all, I see factors that will suppress inflation in the longer term rather than factors that will drive it up. In any case, monetary policy has enough time to respond appropriately to such longer-term trends.   But are climate policies themselves not going to make energy more expensive and push inflation up, at least temporarily?  This could indeed be the case. If the governments keep their commitments on the Paris Agreement and the recent climate conference in Glasgow, it will have an impact on energy prices. Studies show that energy prices react to climate protection measures by increasing significantly at first. However, when demand falls, the price will drop significantly. This effect will materialise.  Deutsche Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann will step down at the end of the year. Will you miss him?  I will. I have the utmost respect for his intellect. I look back fondly on our many encounters over the past few years, for example at G20 meetings. There is one photo in particular that reminds me of that good cooperation– it shows us both at a G20 meeting in Mexico.  Are you not slightly relieved that Mr Weidmann – a big sceptic of the current ECB stance – will be gone?  I am not relieved in the slightest, just the opposite – I am a bit sad that he decided to go. But I am certain the German Government will choose a candidate that will represent the Bundesbank’s views and the concerns of the German people in a similar fashion. I paid close attention to Mr Weidmann’s speech at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress recently. In it, he described the Governing Council of the ECB as a place where any opinion and any concern can be voiced. I see that as part of my approach to leadership. I am 65 and my experience has taught me that it is good to bring people together, exchange arguments and talk openly about concerns and objections. It is only then that you can try to find as much consensus as possible. We cannot always unanimously agree on every single decision.  In a recent speech, Mr Weidmann called on the ECB not to underestimate inflation. Have you been doing that recently?  In recent quarters, we have had to gradually adjust our inflation forecasts. This is true. But most economists all over the world have not fared any better. This experience has taught us to consistently review our baseline scenario and adjust it when needed.  So can you assure us that you will raise interest rates when necessary?  Of course, we will act when necessary. When we see inflation reaching our two per cent target over the medium term, durably and sustainably – meaning not just for a short period of time – then the interest rates can rise again. Such an interest rate hike must serve our mandate of price stability, just like our entire monetary policy. When these conditions are met, no one will be happier than me to normalise monetary policy. Before we can raise rates, however, we will need to reduce our asset purchases.  Unconventional monetary policy measures have now become almost normal – is this not a problem? When asset purchases and negative interest rates were introduced, the general public was told that these measures were temporary. Many now doubt that the ECB will ever go back.  Back in the summer we unanimously approved the outcome of our monetary policy review. Part of that is the medium-term symmetrical inflation target of two per cent. We also agreed on what makes up our toolbox, and asset purchases are explicitly included. We need to ask ourselves which instruments work best to help us fulfil our mandate. We should keep all our tools ready, but we do not need to use all of them all the time.  In 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ECB launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which has allowed it to buy bonds flexibly. Is it really going to end in March 2022, as you promised? The pandemic is coming back with a vengeance right now.  Under the current circumstances, I have no reason to doubt that we will stop net asset purchases under the PEPP in the spring. This does not mean that the PEPP will end completely – the maturing bonds need replacing and these reinvestments will need to continue. And let us not forget that we have other purchase programs in our toolbox. I sincerely hope – for the sake of everyone’s health – that the pandemic will be over in the spring and that we will be more resistant to the new infection waves like the one we are seeing in Europe now. That is out of my hands, though – it is up to the scientists who develop vaccines, and of course to the people themselves, who should decide to get vaccinated.  Robert Holzmann, the Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, has suggested that the ECB should stop all of its asset purchases next autumn if inflation has reached two per cent by then. What do you think of this proposal?  I generally do not comment on what individual heads of central banks have said. All opinions are welcome, but they should be expressed at the right time. That time is 15 and 16 December, when the Governing Council of the ECB meets again.  Some central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, have recently voiced concerns about a global rise in asset prices. Are you also concerned?  Asset purchases have been very efficient, but their impact may weaken over time. Therefore, we must always be mindful of their side-effects, for instance rising asset prices, to decide whether using this tool is still proportionate. Rest assured – we are paying very close attention to it.  Do you not feel that the side-effects are starting to dominate?  No, the impact of the bond purchases is still positive and clearly outweighs the negative side-effects.  Nevertheless, it seems like the ECB shies away from the exit for fear of spooking the financial markets.  It is my strong belief that monetary policy needs to work for all Europeans. The markets are not our primary audience, nor are they the main recipients of our communication. Nevertheless, we do need to pay attention to financial stability. There is no price stability without financial stability. The two are closely interconnected, although it is price stability that is our primary mandate. And our monetary policy affects the economy not only through banks, but also via the financial markets.  Some market players try to put the ECB under pressure by vociferously calling for interest rate increases – for example via Twitter. Do you pay attention to them?  I’m glad to say that I don’t have to follow all the things people say on Twitter. My press team takes care of that.   On the other hand, the ECB is increasingly accused − under the heading of fiscal dominance − of giving too much consideration to European countries’ high levels of debt.   Fiscal policy is not my area. However, I was really very satisfied with the developments on 20 July this year. Europe’s government leaders decided, together, to launch the Next Generation EU recovery fund, which will be able to issue common bonds at the EU level. Germany has also agreed to it. For this, I am very grateful to Angela Merkel who recognised the importance of the issue. It sent a very strong fiscal policy message.   Though, some critics considered the message rather questionable.   Unfairly. You know, the rest of the world always doubts Europe. I have lived long enough outside of Europe to know that and to regret it. However, that agreement in July was a clear demonstration that Europe takes the right decisions when it comes to it. It was a privilege for me, as ECB President, to be able to support this process. It was no stroll in the park. It was a tough debate that cost a lot of time and many long nights. However, it was a strong signal to the world. Now, though, the European governments have a duty to stick to the agreement and to deliver what they promised. They must implement the promised structural reforms and they must shape a strong Europe. Implementation is always the hardest part. I remember well the words of my friend, Wolfgang Schäuble, who – as a minister in the Council of European Finance Ministers – always said “Implementation, implementation, implementation.” He always looked at us very strictly as he said it. And he is right. In the next three years, we will see how well Europe can succeed in this.   Is the ECB then ready to act against the fiscal policy interests of EU Member States, if necessary? Is the ECB independent of political pressure?  We are an independent institution and of course our actions are independent of political pressure. A pressure, by the way, that I often observed abroad as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. It’s no fun for those central bank governors. That is why it is clear to me that we must focus on our mandate. We will simply ignore attempts to exert political influence.   Do you think the ECB will have to withstand even heavier political pressure in the future?  There may be attempts to exert more pressure. But it won’t lead to anything.  Doesn’t all of this depend on the success of your predecessor, Mario Draghi, who is now Italy’s Prime Minister? If Italy gets a handle on its problems, does the ECB President also sleep more peacefully?  All Member States and all European heads of government shoulder huge responsibility. The instruments are here; they are on the table. A good €800 billion is at the ready in the Next Generation EU recovery fund. Now governments must decide how they will use it. That is not my responsibility. However, they should know this can change the course of things.  You also wanted to change a few things at the ECB – for example, the way the ECB communicates with the public. Are you satisfied with the results so far?  We are working on it. Yes, it was my objective from the start to communicate simply without falling into the trap of oversimplifying. That is why, for instance, we have changed the introductory statement that I make before our press conferences after the meetings of the Governing Council. We have shortened it and cut back on the jargon. Sometimes we have used terribly complicated words to explain basic concepts. It doesn’t have to be like that. Without good communication, we cannot do our job as central bankers.  Nevertheless, the introductory statement is still hard to understand for people outside the world of finance.  Yes, that is true. My neighbour certainly won’t be reading it before bed. However, we can still make it more understandable. In times gone by, central bankers were proud of the fact that it was difficult, if not impossible, to understand them. I have the privilege of knowing the former Chair of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, quite well. He would probably disapprove of my approach. Times have changed, however. In the world of fake news, nothing is more important than being properly understood.  There is need for explanation when it comes to your efforts to make monetary policy greener. For many climate activists, you are not doing enough. Greenpeace even paraglided onto the roof of an ECB building to call for more climate protection.  Yes, I remember that well. My first thought was: how dangerous is this – and how can we prevent an accident? Personally, I do not think it is a safe and appropriate way to express your point of view.  Do you perceive the type of criticism as unfair?  Civil organisations have to speak up when they deem it necessary. However, central banks are not in the driving seat when it comes to fighting climate change. We are not the ones who are steering the bus; that is more the governments and parliaments. But we are all sitting on the bus together. And everyone on the bus – that includes you and me – should not forget that climate change is about the survival of humanity. That is why, within our mandate, we have to take climate-related risks into account in our calculations. But of course the ECB does not decide on climate policy.   Let’s end with a personal question. How often is Europe’s monetary policy decided at your kitchen table?  More often than you might think. A few important decisions have been made there. For example, we made decisions on the pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP, at my kitchen table. We were all in lockdown and I sat there without Zoom and without the video conferencing system. Unbelievable how quickly you forget it. Back then, we had one conference call after another. Luckily, we all knew each other well enough already to know who was speaking. Even if I had to ask every now and then.  You said you would see yourself as an owl when it comes to monetary policy. That is to say, you wouldn’t allow yourself to be limited to just one monetary policy position. After two years leading the ECB, do you still see yourself as an owl or are you now more of a dove?  Absolutely as an owl - guided by its mandate. Since I said that, friends from around the world now send me either figurines or photos of owls. I am now a passionate collector of owls.    "
2021-11-23,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Carolynn Look and Alexander Weber on 22 and published on 23 November 2021 ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Carolynn Look and Alexander Weber on 22 and published on 23 November 2021  23 November 2021  The recovery has lost some steam after the initial reopening, and now the pandemic has returned with great force and some countries have imposed new restrictions, Austria even a full lockdown. How worried are you about the economic recovery?  Over the summer we saw a strong recovery, much stronger than many had expected. For a couple of weeks now, the incoming data have been pointing towards some moderation, mainly due to supply chain disruptions, which have proved to be stronger and more persistent than initially thought. Most recently, we are seeing a rise in COVID-19 infections and some containment measures in parts of the euro area, and this is likely to have a moderating effect on activity in the short run, in particular in the contact-intensive services sector. But I do not think that this will derail the overall recovery. Growth factors are quite strong over the medium term. The main reason for the bottlenecks is strong demand. Supply-side disruptions do not diminish growth potential. They merely shift activity over time. So my baseline is that we are going to see some growth deceleration in the short run, but then a continued strong recovery in the medium term.  What does all of this mean for the December staff projections and how will they change?  That's an open question. In general, the supply-side disruptions will have a moderating effect going forward, but I don't see a fundamental change in the growth outlook.  Do you have a timeline in mind for how long the supply-side disruptions and heightened energy prices might last?  This is one of the questions that we are discussing intensively. We've also asked the companies in our corporate telephone survey, and quite a few companies expect the supply chain disruptions to last longer than we thought. A significant share of them even think it's going to be longer than a year. But different sectors will be affected in different ways. On energy, the technical assumption underlying our projections is based on oil futures curves. And these futures curves tend to be downward-sloping, partly due to what is called the ""convenience yield"". If you have a relatively tight oil market, there is an incentive to hold high inventories. But it's not clear that current futures curves are reflecting genuine expectations. If you look at forecasting errors, not just by the ECB but also by other forecasters, energy prices often play an important role.  An interesting question is whether there are certain structural factors that may affect energy price developments going forward. An obvious candidate is the green transition: in the coming years energy prices will likely go up because there's going to be more carbon pricing. Supply may also be less responsive. In the past, when oil prices were going up, there was a relatively strong supply-side reaction, for example from shale oil producers. This reaction has been more muted during the recovery, which may be related to the green transition because it may have become less attractive to invest in these types of facilities. Such structural factors are relatively hard to capture with our models. It's very possible that the pandemic is also accelerating certain structural trends, and we have to be aware of that. This increases the uncertainty going forward.  Do you think that the most recent headwinds – the increase in infections and new restrictions – will have an impact on the near-term inflation outlook, for example by shifting the demand from services to goods again and putting more strain on supply chains?  We haven't really done any analysis on that yet. I would say the general trends remain intact, which means that, compared with our September projections, I would expect higher inflation numbers going forward, mainly due to the fact that the supply chain disruptions are more persistent than we had initially thought. We will have to see whether the current measures will have an additional effect – it's too early to tell.  There's considerable uncertainty about the medium-term outlook for inflation. Many forecasters expect it to be below 2%, but some of your colleagues have warned that it may just as well be above the ECB's target. What's your assessment?  I expect our staff’s inflation projections to be revised upwards for next year, but I still think – and most people would agree – that inflation is going to decline over the course of next year. There are a number of technical factors, such as the reversal of Germany's VAT cut, which is going to drop out at the beginning of the year. We do expect that, over time, the supply-side bottlenecks are going to be gradually resolved. And it's not very likely that energy price developments are going to continue at the same pace as we've seen.  It's plausible to assume that inflation is going to drop below our target of 2% in the medium term. However, the risks to inflation are skewed to the upside. Uncertainty has increased with respect to the pace and extent of the decline. I don't think we can truly tell, on the basis of today's data, what is actually going to happen. In our decision-making, we have to take this increased uncertainty into account. What makes it plausible that inflation is going to drop below 2% again is that the disinflationary forces that we were facing before the pandemic may still be there. However, there could be structural shifts pointing in the other direction. As I said, that is very hard to capture with our models. We therefore have to look very carefully at the incoming data going forward.  Does it make a difference to the ECB's reaction function what the drivers of inflation are? In other words, are you just as likely to react if inflation is largely driven by supply constraints?  The standard prescription would be that monetary policy should look through supply-side shocks. But it matters how long such disruptions persist, because this may have an effect on inflation expectations. This matters greatly for us because rising inflation expectations would have ripple effects on the economy and may then have an effect on wages and inflation. What we're seeing at the moment is that long-term inflation expectations have started to realign with our 2% target. So far, I would say this is good news. On the wage side, so far we have not seen any broad-based wage pressures that could give rise to wage-price spirals. But we do see in our corporate telephone survey that firms expect wages to grow more strongly going forward. There is also no sign that inflation expectations are de-anchored to the upside. But this hinges on the expectation that, if we found that there were very strong inflation dynamics threatening to de-anchor inflation expectations to the upside, we would react to that. We reacted to a potential de-anchoring to the downside. Given our symmetric inflation target, it's just as important that we react to a potential de-anchoring to the upside.  Does that mean that even if there's a medium-term outlook showing inflation at, or above 2%, that you will also need to see increased wage dynamics or changing inflation expectations in order to react to that?  For this we have our forward guidance. If we see that the inflation outlook improves so that the conditions of our forward guidance are fulfilled, there is a natural reason to act on that. We know that our policies are subject to lags. So if we were to wait longer, there would be a risk that we fall behind the curve. But at the moment, this is not the situation that we are facing. The situation now is different because we do not see the medium-term inflation outlook above 2%.   Investors quite stubbornly positioned for a rate hike in late 2022, even as you, President Lagarde and other policymakers said this was a highly unlikely scenario. Why is it so hard for the ECB to drive home its message?  Markets aren’t pricing in a 2022 rate hike anymore. There was a discussion about whether this reflected a lack of understanding by financial markets of our forward guidance. I don't think that that was the case, I always thought that our forward guidance was clear enough to be understood. I think it was rather a reflection of the uncertainty about the inflation outlook itself. There was, and remains, a certain divergence between ECB staff projections and what markets are expecting on inflation. It seems to me that it has become clear that it's very unlikely that a rate hike is going to happen next year. But it's also clear that the uncertainty remains very high and this is reflected in markets.  Is it still likely that the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) will end in March, as Lagarde said at the last press conference, even with the pickup in COVID infections?  This will be discussed in December. I personally think that the time plan is still valid, but we will have to see how this evolves until our December meeting.  What could lead to you possibly extending the PEPP?  The main criterion is the inflation outlook. We always said that the PEPP had the role to counter the negative effect of the pandemic on the inflation outlook. We have to make a judgement on whether what we are seeing now in some Member States is going to fundamentally change the inflation outlook, and at the moment I don't see that.  How do you think it will affect the pace of the PEPP in the first quarter? Will the ECB use the full envelope that's allocated to the PEPP?  That's another decision to be taken in December. If you look at survey expectations, it's not generally assumed that the entire envelope will be used.  A lot of economists expect the asset purchase programme (APP) to be increased from the 20 billion monthly amount that we have right now. Would you support that?  When we think about the December decision, I think we have to separate two questions. The first is: what's the amount of stimulus that is still needed? This is closely related to what we just discussed: how do we see the inflation outlook and how likely is it that we're going to get back, in a durable fashion, to our inflation target of 2% over the medium term? We have to ask ourselves: what is the overall desired monetary policy stance in light of the inflation outlook, taking into account the measures that are already in place? We have negative rates, forward guidance, the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and – what I always stress – a very high stock of acquired assets under the APP and the PEPP. This provides a lot of accommodation. It's not about the flows, but it's mainly about the stocks. This will be the first part of the discussion in December. The second part is: which kind of tools do we want to use in order to provide the stimulus that we find appropriate? This decision again has different components. The first question is: what's the most efficient instrument? This is what we look at in our proportionality assessment, where we analyse the benefits and costs of different tools. For example, if we look at our entire toolkit, in the pandemic, asset purchases have played a very important role. They helped us to restore market functioning. They incentivised people to take risks at a time when they weren't willing to do so. That was very important. The question we'll have to answer today is: what's the role of asset purchases going forward? There are, on the one hand, diminishing returns to asset purchases and, on the other hand, increasing side effects. Therefore, eventually, there will be a shift from asset purchases towards other tools, most importantly our forward guidance. The second issue that we need to consider is how we can best protect the transmission of our policies. As you know, the euro area is vulnerable to fragmentation. If there's fragmentation, our policy is not transmitted fully to all parts of the euro area. This is an important aspect also when transitioning out of the net purchase phase of the PEPP. The PEPP has been extremely effective in that respect. It had this flexibility feature and what we've seen is that the possibility of purchasing flexibly by itself already had a stabilising effect. If you look at the numbers, you see that actual capital key deviations were occurring mainly at the very beginning of the programme, at the time of the market turbulence. Once markets had stabilised, it was no longer necessary. Of course, there was also flexibility over time and there was some flexibility across asset classes, but the flexibility across jurisdictions was mainly used at the very beginning of the pandemic. It's important to acknowledge the crucial role of that flexibility. The PEPP will not disappear once net asset purchases have been reduced to zero. Sometimes people talk about ending the PEPP. The PEPP is not going to end in March. The net asset purchases probably, but not the PEPP as such.  You've spoken about the importance of ending QE first and then raising interest rates. Other governors have also spoken about this wording, suggesting that there might be a preference to have a longer gap between the end of net asset purchases and raising interest rates. How do you feel about that particular issue?  I don't think that's something we have to decide at this point in time. For now, this forward guidance serves us well, and we may want to reconsider it at some later point.  What would be your preference for how to address the threat of fragmentation after the end of net purchases under the PEPP?  That's going to be discussed in December. But as I said, the PEPP won’t be gone.  There's been speculation about a new facility that isn't actively buying, but on standby, and that could buy more flexibly than the APP. Is this something you would consider?  The principle of the PEPP is precisely what you said. There is a possibility to buy flexibly. That is something that is very useful, but we already have that under the PEPP.  But you won't have that after March.  The PEPP is a flexible programme. This is what I can say.  Would it make a difference whether to transfer this flexibility to the APP, extend the PEPP in some way, or introduce a new facility?  At this point in time, the APP doesn't have this feature, while the PEPP has it. It's not clear to me that it's necessary to transfer flexibility to the APP.  How could the PEPP secure this kind of flexibility after the end of net purchases?  This will have to be discussed.   But it's important to you that this flexibility remains in some way and fragmentation can be addressed?  Certainly, yes. Especially in this transition phase, this is important. The coronavirus crisis phase isn't a black or white thing. Leaving the pandemic will be a process. This is also reflected in the sequencing of our measures. First, under the PEPP, the net asset purchases are stopped, and then at some later point, the reinvestment is stopped. It has to be a gradual phasing out of pandemic measures. Not everything can happen at once.  Is the euro area more vulnerable to fragmentation now than before the pandemic, because of higher debt levels?  I wouldn't necessarily say so. Of course we have higher sovereign debt levels, but on the other hand, we've had a crucial European initiative on the fiscal side, which sent a very strong signal that there's a strong commitment to stand together. I wouldn't underestimate the effect that this has, also on the risk of fragmentation. Next Generation EU is not a permanent facility, but it has been a major step that many people thought was unthinkable before the pandemic.  Some of the changes that we've seen floated are the idea of moving from monthly amounts for the APP to an envelope, similar to what we had for the PEPP. And there's also the proposal to include Greek debt in the APP. How would you feel about those changes?  On the question how the purchases are distributed over time, from a theoretical perspective, that shouldn't matter much − at least if you adhere to the stock view of QE. I think the distribution is of secondary importance. We saw that the flows mattered greatly at the time of the market turbulence. But in normal times, I don't think this is particularly important, which would imply that there's not necessarily a need to change what we have. On the second point, I would say that Greece is benefiting greatly from the purchases under the PEPP. Going forward, there will still be a significant market presence under the PEPP due to reinvestment. It will have to be discussed whether that is sufficient.  You said one fundamental question you need to answer in December is how much accommodation does the euro area need, but at the same time, the inflation outlook is so uncertain. What's the time horizon for which you can even take decisions in December?  Again, that's something to be discussed, but I certainly wouldn't pre-commit over a too long period of time. That would be a mistake. I explained this in a recent speech that I gave on 17 November 2021. At times of very high uncertainty, it's extremely important to retain some optionality in the monetary policy decision-making process. I called it, borrowing from Alan Greenspan, the risk management approach, which implies that when uncertainty is very high, one shouldn't enter into too long commitments, but one has to make sure that one can react to all types of contingencies. Our strong forward guidance protects us against premature rate hikes. But we also need to be able to react to surprises on the upside, should they materialise. We need to allow the data to come in so that we can get more clarity about what is going to happen after the unusual movements in inflation that we've seen this year and that we're also going to see next year. It would be risky to base our decisions entirely on the baseline if we know that the risks are skewed to the upside.  Should the TLTROs be extended past December?  The TLTROs have been a very effective tool in the pandemic. Besides asset purchases, this was our second main tool, which has supported bank lending, and therefore our monetary policy stance. The experience with TLTROs has been very positive. That was partly due to the innovation that we had, with extremely favourable interest rates, which was a response to the severity of the pandemic. It's an open question whether any additional operations will be needed. This is also related to other decisions that will have to be taken, for example, on the question of collateral eligibility or the question of the tiering multiplier. But I would say that for those decisions, we have a bit more time. This doesn't have to happen in December.  When you joined the ECB's Executive Board, you identified myths and half-truths that were being told in Germany about monetary policy and the ECB in particular. You've tried to address those in speeches and interviews. You've talked very frequently in German media. Do you feel like you've made any progress in the last two years? How difficult is it now that inflation is approaching these really high rates?  It's up to others to truly judge that. I identified a very important problem at the time and I tried to address it as well as I could, but of course I'm only one player in this big game. Certainly, some of the myths are still there. In the context of rising inflation, new narratives appear. The need to explain and to communicate to the general public is just as pressing as it was before, or maybe even more so. That's also why I'm so happy that in the strategy review, the communication to the general public was considered a key part of our communication – I would say probably for the first time in such an explicit way. However, if you look at the entire discourse about inflation in Germany and in other countries, I do think it has become more differentiated. I cannot remember that general newspapers previously wrote so much about technical issues like base effects. There are now quite a few newspapers trying to explain these very unusual inflation dynamics without creating a sense of panic. Not all newspapers are doing that, but I would say quite a few. What my contribution is to that, I cannot say. But at least I think we observe a serious attempt to understand what's going on. The debate about inflation is very important. As long as this debate is conducted at a factual level, this is more than welcome. But if there are misunderstandings in the public, it's our job to explain because monetary policy is such a technical matter. It's so hard to understand. Even for people who are trained in economics, it's sometimes hard to understand. We have to learn to find the proper language to explain those things to the general public. We rely on people’s trust. It is extremely important for the credibility and effectiveness of our monetary policy, and for preserving our independence. If there are concerns, we have to take them seriously and we have to think about how we can respond to them. At times it's difficult because the commentary goes to a personal level that is not acceptable. There we can do very little. But as long as it's related to real-world phenomena, we can explain − and we are doing so. We've just published an explainer on inflation on our website, which tries to deal with some of the current concerns. We are also trying to go into different types of media. We're more active in social media, some of us even personally. We try to also talk to people who are active on YouTube and other channels. We have to find ways to be heard and ideally also understood. I think that's important.   Your name has been floated as a potential successor to the outgoing Bundesbank president Jens Weidman. If you were offered the job, would you take it?  The position of Bundesbank president is one of the most important positions in Germany. It comes with a lot of responsibility, not just towards Germany, but towards Europe. I certainly have a lot of respect for that position. You will understand that I cannot contribute to any of those speculations. I focus on the difficult decisions that we have to take in December.   "
2021-11-08,Philip R. Lane,Interview with El País,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Lluís Pellícer on 3 November 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with El País   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Lluís Pellícer on 3 November 2021 8 November 2021  The ECB revised its projections for the euro area economy upwards in September. But the official data show that growth in countries like Spain and Germany is lower than expected. Is the recovery at risk?  Each euro area country has its own economic profile, and although the pandemic was a common shock it has hit countries in different ways. Those countries with a large tourism sector, such as Spain, were particularly affected. But this in itself is not a threat to the recovery. It is just a question of time, and any dips that happen now will be balanced out by improvements later on. We don’t think the recovery process is over; we actually think that growth will be pretty strong in 2022. The countries that are lagging slightly behind have a lot of available capacity. Spain’s productivity has not been harmed by the pandemic, so it’s a matter of reviving activity. Part of this relates to demand: the tourist season will be better next year. And the other part concerns bottlenecks, which ultimately will be resolved. There are other factors that make us confident that we will recover quite well over the next year or so, such as the savings that people have accumulated during the pandemic, the Next Generation EU fund, particularly for a large recipient like Spain, and the high vaccination rates.  But there have been a number of setbacks for the European economy in recent weeks, including supply problems, bottlenecks, higher energy prices, price increases and the threat of new variants. At what stage of the recovery does all of this disappear?  The global recovery this year has been quicker than expected. In that context, of course bottlenecks can occur because supply is not keeping up, but that will be largely fixed next year. The fast recovery has also meant that energy demand has exceeded forecasts. Now the situation may last longer than we would like, but these headaches are not going to wipe out the underlying momentum of the recovery. And it is not only about getting back to where we were before the pandemic – it’s also about catching up to the growth that we should have had in 2020 and 2021. So there is still a lot of momentum in the system.  Europe is close to returning to its pre-pandemic level of GDP, but this is not going to be the case for Spain. Is there a risk of the gap between north and south getting bigger again?   Some countries may be recovering somewhat more slowly, but they will recover; the disruption is a very temporary one that is linked to the tourism industry. And the Next Generation EU fund has been designed to ensure that all parts of the EU not only recover, but also have strong medium-term prospects. In the coming years, the high public and private investment connected to this plan will support countries such as Spain and Italy in particular. The situation now is completely different from 12 years ago during the global financial crisis. We may be moving at different speeds, but Europe will recover quite well over the next year or so.  The ECB President, Christine Lagarde, said that inflation took centre stage at the October Governing Council meeting. She was very clear: “inflation, inflation, inflation”. How long do you think price increases will continue?  Inflation is unexpectedly high at the moment, but we do think it is going to fall next year. And if we look at the situation over the medium term, the inflation rate is still too low, below our 2 per cent target, not too high. The currently high inflation is linked to the fact that the recovery has been strong at the global level. We have these bottlenecks and high energy costs, which together are the main factor behind the price increases. I know that in Spain energy costs have also risen significantly. We think that next year the bottlenecks will ease and energy prices will drop or stabilise. There are also other factors, such as the recovery of some prices that had fallen in 2020. So yes, we did talk about “inflation, inflation, inflation”, but this period of inflation is very unusual and temporary, and not a sign of a chronic situation. The situation we are in now is very different from the 1970s and 1980s.  Faced with the rising cost of living, some German unions are demanding wage increases of at least 4 per cent. Are you worried that these negotiations might continue feeding inflation?  There is a collective interest in closely observing what is going on, but we have to take a nuanced view. In recent decades we have seen that wage increases at the euro area level have not been high enough to generate inflation of 2 per cent. That said, such negotiations should also be shaped by wider considerations, such as productivity and the competitiveness of a country, sector or firm. It is important that wage negotiations consider the increased cost of living but also avoid unsustainable increases in labour costs. Finding this balance is key. We will look out for unsustainable patterns that might lead to pressures that are undesirable from an inflation perspective. But let me emphasise: we don’t see this right now. It’s more of a risk factor that we need to take a look at, rather than something where we see any evidence building.  Inflation concerns are spreading in Germany, where strong criticism of the ECB has already emerged. Could this climate accelerate the withdrawal of the emergency asset purchase programme?  Our monetary policy decisions are not driven by any form of external pressure. The EU Treaties grant the ECB independence to do its job, which is to achieve 2 per cent inflation over the medium term, so inflation that is neither too high nor too low. Key to our decision-making is our assessment of medium-term inflation, so inflation over a multi-year horizon. With our medium-term perspective on inflation, we’re highly focused on where the trend of inflation may go in 2023, in 2024 and so on, rather than on the near-term dynamic. In terms of our policy, we’re not focused on any particular individual component, because of course, our monetary policy runs across different categories, not just the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), but also the regular asset purchase programme (APP). We also have the level of interest rates, and we have our targeted lending programme, the TLTROs. So we have many dimensions that work together with our monetary policy, but our monetary policy will be decided on the basis of what is needed to make sure that inflation stabilises at 2 per cent over the medium term. The short-term volatility is something that we have to look through. At the same time, we also have a responsibility to explain that there are powerful reasons to believe inflation will fall next year, and that we have to be sufficiently patient so as not to overreact to a temporary increase in inflation.  The ECB President maintains that you are not in the tapering phase [of stimulus being withdrawn], but the markets seem to believe that you are, given the increase in risk premia…  I do not want to dwell on day-by-day market fluctuations, because these have moved in both directions over the last week. For me, tapering would suggest putting an end to the asset purchases or quantitative easing. This is being discussed in the United States and the United Kingdom, but not in the euro area. What has been discussed is the recalibration of the asset purchases: at the beginning of the year, when there was pressure on interest rates, we did more, and now in autumn we are doing less. The scale of the purchases will feature in our decision-making, but we think the euro area is nowhere near a situation where we bring asset purchases to an end. The situation is completely different to that of some other countries.  What is the reason for that difference?  Since the global financial crisis inflation in Europe has been well below the 2 per cent target. The United States and the United Kingdom, however, are facing a greater risk of inflation rising above that level over the medium term. And we are not at the same stage in the economic cycle either.  Does the reaction from the markets support maintaining purchases so as to prevent an increase in financing costs?  We are driven by the inflation outlook. We do care very much about financing conditions, but we assess these over a longer horizon than in any given week. That there has been volatility in the last week or two is not a determining factor. We would look at the basic underlying trends. We have many tools to influence financing conditions, and I think during the pandemic over the past year and a half we have greatly contributed to the recovery by ensuring that financing conditions are favourable.  And does Jens Weidmann’s departure or the arrival of a new government in Germany make it easier to continue purchases?  All the members of the Governing Council, all the national central bank governors, are there as Europeans. They are not there to represent any one country. And they all take a European perspective in the discussions about monetary policy. Jens is a very good monetary economist and has made a very significant contribution to that debate. It is natural that sometimes there are differences in views across Governing Council members. But it is important to emphasise that, by and large, we make decisions by consensus, and quite often by unanimity. Also remember that this summer we reviewed and unanimously approved our monetary policy strategy.  Spain is still lagging behind other euro area member countries in the recovery. Is there a risk of that recalibration or the new steps that might be taken in December affecting its ability to obtain funding in the markets?  Let me stress that all countries, no matter where they are now, are set for a very good recovery. Some may be a few months later than others, but I don’t think there should be concerns about new permanent differentials emerging. I would say that we set monetary policy for the euro area, it is not tailored to specific countries. Some countries might complain it’s a little bit too easy, if an economy is already at full capacity. For other countries operating below capacity, they may sometimes feel that the policy is a bit too tight. We have to be in the middle. But there should be no doubt that we will make sure that Europe has a strong recovery, and that this recovery doesn’t get derailed as a result of an unnecessary tightening of financing costs.   "
2021-11-03,Frank Elderson,Interview with Bloomberg TV,"Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua, Bloomberg TV, on 2 November","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg TV   Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua, Bloomberg TV, on 2 November 3 November 2021  Frank Elderson, thank you so much for joining us here on Bloomberg. Some very exciting commitments from banks; how do you look at what we've heard today?  Today the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System, the NGFS, has come out with the Glasgow Declaration: “Committed to action”. This means that the now 100 – today actually we reached 100 members – central banks and supervisors around the world have committed to a number of actions.  Which means what exactly? What kind of concrete actions are we expecting? There's a lot of talk. If you're a bank today, how should you be looking at this?  What we have committed to, for example, is to do work on the data gaps – and I can explain a little bit more – work on monetary policy, work on capacity building, work on some issues that have been worked on a little bit less, such as litigation – climate litigation is also something that is increasingly apparent – and biodiversity loss. I think that in terms of monetary policy, data, capacity building, biodiversity loss and litigation, there are a number of very clear commitments that our membership has now signed up to.  If you look at data, what's the right data point for banks to look at how their clients emit? Where do they look for it and where do they find it?  It's very good that you bring up this subject because data are absolutely key. We do visit banks and some banks will just tell you that there are not enough data. There are a lot of data but they are difficult to find. One of the commitments that we have put in our declaration that we issued today is that we will come up with a data repository, so a place where banks, where financial institutions more generally can go to and find, in an easy way, in a way that is continuously being updated, the various data sources that are there in order to help them to manage their climate-related and biodiversity loss-related financial risks.  The ECB told banks late last year what they can expect in terms of climate stress tests. Have you since told them to fix the glaring issues?  We have a very clear roadmap. Last year we came out with a guide with regulatory supervisory expectations. We asked the banks to actually come to us in terms of self-assessments, and they have done so. There is bad news, and that is that 90% of the banks that are under our supervision, self-assessed as not living up entirely to our expectations. Now, part of that plan is also a microprudential stress test that we will do next year. And there it is very important that banks develop this technology, this method, in order to be able to gauge these risks going forward.  Which type of bank did worse in those kinds of stress tests?  Well, you cannot really say. Let me turn this question around: you could see that there were good practices among different banks, different business models and different geographies. Actually, what we have been seeing is that it is possible to live up to our expectations because we have seen banks that are different living up to them. But too many don't do so yet, so we are very much intent on making sure that they will in the near future.  By doing that indirectly, will it raise their capital requirements and will it do so already this year?  What we have said is that the microprudential stress test that we will run next year – and the methodology of which we published a very short time ago – is to a certain extent still a learning exercise. A learning exercise for the banks but also for us as the prudential supervisor. What we have said is: this is not yet about capital. It could be that, if we see very egregious examples, in an indirect way this might affect their scores under Pillar 2; this is rather technical. But this is not what this is about this time.  When you look at some of what we're expecting from COP26, what are you most excited about? I know you've laid out some of the things and some of the great work that you've helped achieve. What does it mean for the big chief executives of banks today? Can they still lend to companies that pollute a lot?  Four years ago, there were eight central banks and supervisors that founded the NGFS. Now there are 100. This means that 100 central banks and supervisors around the world are wielding their leverage on the banks that they supervise. All global systemically relevant banks are under the supervision of members of the NGFS. Two-thirds of the big insurance companies are under the supervision of members of the NGFS. That means that when we say that we’ve come up with these commitments, it means that every CEO of every bank, of every insurance undertaking, will notice that. They will have to think very seriously about how they will manage their climate-related and biodiversity loss-related financial risks.  At the moment, given your conversations are a lot about banks, do you see tension between the chief executives and maybe some of the chief sustainability officers that sit on the board?  I would say that a bank having a sustainability office is so 2011! We now need banks – and this is what our expectations are all about – to really incorporate this in their very DNA, in their business models, in their management information systems, in their risk management. For a bank, this is not some kind of a fringe, this is core.  But are they cutting off clients in the polluting industries enough, and when will this accelerate?  I want to celebrate the fact that many banks are now signing up to the GFANZ – the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Banks are voluntarily entering into net zero commitments. Now, what we are saying, and what I've been pleading for also personally, is that it is of course wonderful that there is a voluntary initiative, but this should be made mandatory. My point would be that I would very much welcome in the new package of the European Commission that, at least in the European Union, there be a clear mandatory legal requirement for banks to have Paris-compatible transition plans so that we can easily supervise their alignment with the Paris Accord.

2021-09-24,Christine Lagarde,Interview with CNBC,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach, CNBC, on 23 September","   INTERVIEW  Interview with CNBC   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach, CNBC, on 23 September 24 September 2021  Let me first ask you about your first two years, because it's almost two years that you are now at the helm of the institution, so what have been the most challenging moments in that time?  It has been very different from what I had expected in the first place. I wasn't expecting a walk in the park, but I was expecting something more quiet than what we had. The first thing that really hit our radar screen was the COVID crisis, where one country after the other locked down, stopped its activity, and where we had to respond extremely fast. Then I had certain issues with some national court that wanted to challenge the validity of what had been done. And I had initially planned on starting a strategy review, which had not taken place in the last 17 years, at the Central Bank. We started it, we suspended it; we started it again and now we have completed that. So altogether it's been a very, very busy couple of years, with massive engagement to support the economic activity in spite of this terrible pandemic that came to hit all of us.  It doesn't stop because what we are witnessing today is inflation picking up a lot faster than previously expected, supply chains being disrupted across the planet. What's your assessment here: do you think that we're seeing inflation actually being stickier than when your last round of forecasts was conducted?  That we will see when we have the data and the numbers, because we are really data-dependent. We try to assess the situation based on figures, on data, on facts. We don't like to operate on the basis of hearsay, assumption here, price increases there. What is true, though, is that we have been revising upward many of our projections in the last three quarters. Things have picked up faster – and that is true for growth, that is true for inflation and that is true for employment. So, in a way, it's a package of good news because it means that our economies are responding, jobs are being created again. The service activities, which were completely down for so long, are now coming back in full swing. So all that is good, but of course it induces frictions and those bottlenecks of those supply chains that have been disrupted because of the pandemic, and where reinitiating the machine is taking time. In the main, all of that – we hope – will last when it comes to growth so that activity continues. We hope it will last when it comes to jobs so that employment continues and unemployment goes down, and for prices we think that there will be a return to much more stability in the year to come because many of the causes of higher prices are temporary. When you look at what's causing it, a lot of it has to do with energy prices. You look back a year ago, prices were rock bottom. They have of course moved up and the difference is explaining a lot of the inflation that unfortunately people are experiencing at the moment. The same goes for some VAT impact, where VAT was reduced in order to stimulate activity. Particularly in Germany, now VAT is back. So that's another base effect, if you will, that explains the price levels that we are seeing now.  It seems that for the first time in many, many years the so-called slack in the euro area is actually reducing, meaning that wages are also on the rise because there are not enough people to fill the open positions. Is that something you are monitoring or acknowledging as well?  Oh yes, we're paying great and close attention to this issue of slack, and there is still quite a lot of slack in terms of employment. We still have at least one million more people unemployed today than pre-pandemic. So there is still a lot of ground to cover for employment to return to the pre-pandemic levels. We hope it will happen and as we close that gap, clearly the economic activity will continue to be stimulated and we will see movement on the inflation front.  Is that also the reason why during the last press conference you didn't want to say that this is tapering, what you have decided – because in a way it is, because you're reducing stimulus! What is tapering?  I said the lady is not for tapering!  Exactly!  The lady is for calibrating, because this has been our policy: our monetary policy is intended to procure favourable financing conditions. Why is that? Because we want to support the economic players – whether it's households, whether it's enterprises, large corporates, sovereigns – all of them need to have favourable financing conditions to cross that bridge towards the post-pandemic stage. And to make sure that there are favourable financing conditions, we look at the whole chain of financing. We look at the inflation outlook and we determine how much monetary support is needed, and that helps us calibrate the purchases that we believe are necessary – which is why we calibrated and decided to purchase moderately in the coming quarter.  You said you were planning on purchasing moderately: what does it mean in numbers? Does it mean 60, 70 or is there more flexibility to it?  There is flexibility to the pandemic emergency programme. That is one of the landmarks of the PEPP, as we call it, the pandemic emergency purchase programme. Because we want to adjust, we want to have the ability to really operate as close to variations as possible to make sure that financing conditions remain favourable. So it works both ways: if we see that less purchases will still procure those favourable financing conditions, we will purchase less; if we see that more is needed, we will add to the purchases.  The Financial Times has run a story based on a call between German economists and your Chief Economist that soon after the projection horizon, inflation will hit 2%, and they had the conclusion from that that a rate hike could be on the cards already by 2023. So why is that wrong, in your opinion? You have defended that conclusion.  It is not at all our conclusion – and anybody is free to draw their own conclusions on the basis of hearsay, second-hand information, quick look at this or that. What I know for a fact, because I know my Chief Economist and my colleague and friend, Philip Lane, is that he never would have said something like what was alleged to have been said. Now, of course he would say, and I would say, that if we continue having a good monetary policy in the future, at some stage we must hit the 2% mark. Because that's our job; price stability is defined under our new strategy review by reference to the 2% inflation mark, which is identified over a period of time – because we are not going to respond abruptly, we are not going to trust one number. But of course we believe that if our monetary policy is successful, we will indeed hit the 2% inflation. Of course.  But my understanding of your forward guidance always was that it needs to be 2% over the whole projection horizon and only after that you would think about hiking rates. Is that correct?  No, it's not over the whole projection horizon; what we say is that we want to see inflation at that 2% level, say, midway during the projection period, and lasting all the way to the end of our horizon. We also want to make sure that as we speak, so at the time when we look at the economic situation, the underlying factors give us sufficient confidence that we will reach that for the medium term.  Let's talk also about the economic outlook because we are seeing at least for Germany but also for other countries, downgrades to the economic outlook, currently also because of the bottlenecks but also because of the higher net energy prices, which are clearly a drag on companies' performance. How concerned are you that you actually need to revise your growth outlook downward?  We work on the basis of facts, figures, numbers and then we do the best job we can to project. At the moment, we have been revising our projection upward rather than downward and the numbers that we are seeing at the moment lead us to believe that we are still in line with our projections. We will have new projections in December so we'll see at that time, but for the moment we are in synch and in line with our projection.  Coming back to inflation and the energy prices, because what we're seeing with the gas price currently happening is unprecedented, what is your assessment here? Do you think these kinds of imbalances in certain markets will be something which we will be witnessing more often?  You know, we're coming from a situation which was unprecedented, where everything stopped, and we are in this phase where everything is being reset, if you will. It's inevitable that in those circumstances there are bottlenecks. There is a shortage of supply relative to much higher demand. There is an adjustment period that is taking place at the moment. Typically what we've seen in previous circumstances, previous crises, previous supply shortages, bottlenecks, is that it is resolved over the course of time. When you cannot get your spare parts from a particular source, you try to identify another source. Remember some of those very serious damages to supply chains, for instance when there were tsunamis or very dramatic incidents in Japan, in particular. Everybody thought that it would be damaged and disrupted for the next 12 months. Well, in a matter of three months the supplies were identified, new supply chains were put in place. Things will fall into place as new sources of supply will be identified. Energy is going to be a matter that will probably stay with us longer because we are transitioning as well from fossil-industry-driven sources of energy to what we aspire to be much less fossil sources. So that's a transition that is in play.  Yes, I remember I think I've asked you once whether you think this transition into a CO2-free world will have deflationary or rather inflationary aspects or forces. At the time, you said it's not clear yet, but is it clearer now?  My fear is that it's not much more clear today. We are beginning to see some studies and academics are looking into it, and I think the jury is still out. My hunch from having read some of those is that it's likely to be pushing prices up for a short period of time, and probably later on might have some deflationary impact. But it's very, very premature and early days to say.  Yesterday the Fed had an all-important meeting and it's clear that they are now on the trajectory of exiting their extraordinary measures. How much of a time lag do you think there is between the ECB and the Fed?  I have no idea! We are operating with different programmes. There is an element of tapering in the way they have structured their support package to the economy, whereas we are not in that situation. We are in the process of calibrating, and we have begun calibrating. Because this is the fact for October, November, December based on the latest decision that we made, but it's calibrating. It's making sure that we are procuring those favourable financing conditions and purchasing what is needed in order to provide that. The Fed is doing something slightly different and I don't know whether they're doing it. My colleague and friend, Mr Powell, just said that November might be the time – but it's fact-dependent again.  He also was saying that he thinks that the Evergrande problematic or market turbulence is purely a Chinese problem. Do you think that as well, because it clearly has spillover effects on the debt markets? For now it's only Chinese, but the markets are very global.  You know, we are looking at it, we are monitoring it and I had a briefing earlier on today because I think that all financial markets are interconnected. I have very vivid memories of the latest stock market developments in China that had a bearing across the world. But in Europe and in the euro area in particular, direct exposure would be limited.  Are you concerned that from the investors' panic modus – which can clearly easily spill over to other parts of the world as well – are you concerned that something like that could happen if the Chinese state really let them fall?  As I told you, for the moment what we are seeing is China-centric impact and exposure, and I can't speak for the United States. I can say for Europe that its direct exposure is limited.  We have a very important election coming up on Sunday. I know you don't really like to talk about German politics but just in terms of political risk, I'll frame it a bit wider, the question. We also have the French election next year and then the year after, the Italian election. Are you concerned that political risk might be back in Europe, especially as a leader of 16 years is going to leave?  Well, I will take this opportunity to salute the 16 years that have been completed and pay tribute to Chancellor Merkel, who has done so much on the international scene in particular, representing Germany. Any uncertainty is always propitious to movements and anticipation and fear, so I would say that once the election is over and you have more certainty about the outcome, pending coalition discussions, then it's a better situation than before, because then you have the uncertainty. Who is it going to be? What kind of coalition will it be? Which President will be elected in France? I think that once the election is over, then everybody knows what to expect and prepares for that, so it reduces uncertainty, actually.  Perhaps we are terminating the interview with a look back to perhaps a common experience with Angela Merkel, as you were saluting her for her 16 years, and her role as an international diplomat. If you look back, what kind of memories do you have and perhaps the most important meeting or memory you have from working together with her?  Dozens of G7, G20, but I think the one that I will cherish is this time when the two of us went to the concert hall together, just very privately. She had one security officer, I had one. We went together in the same car and people were so respectful and discreet about her in Berlin, going to the concert, that was a lovely moment. It was Daniel Barenboim conducting, so what else can you wish?!  I bet it was a great evening!  Yes – and we had a lovely dinner after that.  Thank you very much for talking to us today.  My pleasure.   "
2021-09-17,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Joost van Kuppeveld and Daan Ballegeer","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Joost van Kuppeveld and Daan Ballegeer 17 September 2021  [Introduction by the FD on inflation and its effect on savings]  “I fully understand that many people are complaining about the low interest rates, but you can’t look at purchasing power purely in terms of inflation,” De Guindos says. “You need to look at all of the effects of our policy. If negative rates are necessary for Europeans in order to boost the economy and retain their jobs, then that helps a significant share of society. With such a policy there are always trade-offs. As a Spanish minister of finance once said, what is good for your kidneys is bad for your liver, and what’s bad for your kidneys is good for your liver. You need to seek a balance.” Moreover, it’s not a sure thing that interest rates will remain low for long, the Spaniard finds. “Structural forces that have been at the root of the low interest rates, such as globalisation, digitalisation and demographic developments, may be evolving. What consequences will the pandemic have over the longer term? I think that globalisation is starting to decline, and that supply chains are no longer as widely dispersed as they once were.” Within the ECB, de Guindos is neither seen as a dove nor a hawk, meaning that he has no pronounced preference for stimulating economic growth rather than keeping inflation in check. He is known first and foremost as a courageous pragmatist. De Guindos prefers to call himself a technocrat than a politician, as he has never been elected. He is credited for steering Spain’s economic recovery following the great financial crisis, by fostering structural reforms, notably in the labour market and a deep restructuring of the banking sector. When he took up his position in 2018, hawks feared that, given his background, de Guindos would be too political, too willing also to make monetary concessions. That fear only swelled when, one year later, Mario Draghi ended his term as ECB President, and de Guindos began working under another former minister of finance: Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde.  Is such “politicisation” at the head of the ECB desirable?  “I do not agree with that description. The ECB is an independent institution. But a central bank cannot be an ivory tower; you have to keep in touch with reality and with what people are asking for. We are not almighty and have no philosophers’ stone with which to transform everything we touch into gold. The ECB’s Governing Council is made up of a nicely balanced combination of pure central bankers, academics and seven former ministers of finance, myself included. That makes for great discussions.” These discussions brought forth the strategy review, which was completed this year and involved a reassessment of the underlying principles and targets of monetary policy. “A great achievement”, in de Guindos' view. The central bankers unanimously chose a new definition of price stability. Inflation no longer has to be “below, but close to, 2%” but rather amount to 2% over the medium term. The target is symmetric, in the sense that negative and positive deviations of inflation from the target are equally undesirable. And two percent should not be interpreted as a ceiling.  The central bankers also stressed that some policy instruments, which were unconventional at the start of the euro in 1999, or simply did not exist, are now absolutely normal. Just think of negative interest rates, the issuance of longer-term loans and asset purchase programmes. “They are at our disposal and we will continue to make use of them”, de Guindos said, emphasising that the ECB will also take financial stability considerations into account in its monetary policy deliberations.   What consequences are you referring to specifically?  “Potential vulnerabilities in the financial landscape, such as stock market developments, debt levels of firms and households and the path of house prices may give rise to financial stability risks. We have a framework to formally include such issues in our decision-making.”  You haven’t mentioned sovereign debt levels although these have soared over the past few years. Isn’t the ECB itself in danger of being held hostage by governments through its extensive portfolio of sovereign debt?   “The pandemic was an exceptional event. Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies were crucial in order to tackle the consequences of the pandemic, and the policy mix helped to prevent a far more severe crisis. But monetary policy has remained independent throughout.” “It must be crystal clear that our primary and ultimate aim is price stability, and so our focus is on the path of inflation. Our decisions must be felt throughout the entire euro area, and therefore we have to prevent market fragmentation.” “I’d also like to point out that the fear of ‘fiscal dominance’ remains limited because a lot of new government debt keeps coming to the market. According to our estimates, in the short and medium term we will not reach the limits that we have set for ourselves. They are there precisely to ensure that we have a market economy, with private parties playing the most important role in the bond markets.”  Both the government debt and the budget deficits of many euro area countries are way over the limits in the Stability and Growth Pact.  “Even before the outbreak of the pandemic there was discussion about the Pact, because there were problems with the limits (60% of GDP for government debt, and 3% for the budget deficit, ed.) and procyclicality. But the Stability and Growth Pact demonstrated its flexibility, we were able to tackle the pandemic, that’s pretty clear.”  You are praising the flexibility of the Pact, but it was simply deactivated.  “The Pact includes an escape clause under which the 3% limit is suspended and countries are allowed to increase their deficits. So the rules were adhered to.” “That’s not to say that the Pact can’t be improved, and so made easier to explain to the public. The European Commission is going to launch a public consultation on this and I think that those discussions will be very interesting. Personally I think that the two main elements of a future SGP should be a simple and clear expenditure rule and the evolution of the public debt ratio.” “The pandemic has widened the disparities between countries with a low deficit and low debt and countries with a high deficit and high debt. The latter will have to make an extra effort once the pandemic is over.”  Inflation in the euro area has now been above target for months. The ECB says that this is temporary and it will fall back to below 2%, but not everyone is convinced. A fake €1,000 banknote featuring Christine Lagarde is doing the rounds on social media. Made in Germany.  “We expect inflation to continue accelerating until November this year and then fall to 1.7% in 2022 and 1.5% the year after. There are good reasons for the current, higher level, such as the slump in economic activity last year due to the pandemic and thus in the level we’re now comparing prices with. Furthermore there was a temporary reduction in VAT in Germany in the second half of last year, that kind of thing.” “Inflation this year may turn out even higher than we now think if the supply problems persist. That has consequences not just for the prices of microchips and semiconductors, but also for energy and transport prices, for instance. Also, so far we have seen few wage rises on the back of the higher prices. That may change in the autumn, when many wage negotiations get under way and we will be vigilant on these possible developments.”  Since the euro crisis there has been a clear split in public opinion between the “core countries” and the “periphery” of the euro area. Do you also see such a division, and can it be reversed?  “Ten years ago – a period of rescue plans – the differences were much bigger and more relevant than today. That's thanks to the efforts of a number of southern European countries, which paid off in growth, thereby enhancing the internal cohesion within the euro area. Take Spain for example. Major efforts were undertaken there to boost competitiveness, reduce the government deficit, and improve the balance of payments.”  Officially EU Member States have to introduce the euro once they fulfil certain conditions. What does it say about support for the euro if large countries like Poland refuse to do so?  “According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union the euro is the currency of Europe, and people in the euro area are very satisfied with it. Two countries have asked to join, Croatia and Bulgaria, and they are now fully engaged in that process. Their desire to participate in this project is to be welcomed, both from a political and an economic perspective.”   "
2021-09-16,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by David Rubenstein, Bloomberg, on 13 September","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by David Rubenstein, Bloomberg, on 13 September 16 September 2021  Today we're in conversation with Christine Lagarde, who is the President of the European Central Bank.    As we now look at the post-COVID environment, what would you say is the situation in Europe? Is Europe recovering more rapidly, or not quite as rapidly as you'd thought, from the COVID pandemic?  Actually, Europe is recovering more rapidly than we had anticipated. We have, as a result of that, significantly upgraded our projections. Our projection for this year is plus 5%, so it's a significant upgrade, plus 4.6% next year and back to pre-COVID type of growth subsequently. But this year it’s certainly going faster than we had thought – to the point where we will have recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels before the end of the year, 2021. We had anticipated earlier on that it would be early 2022 at best; it's now going to be in 2021.  Well, are you worried about the Delta variant impacting what you've just said, or the so-called Mu variant, which is now something that's on the horizon?  It's very closely related. We used to say that the best economic policy was an accelerated vaccination roll-out. Well, we are still in that situation where vaccination matters enormously. But on that front, Europe has done quite well. We have more than 70% of the adult population that is completely vaccinated in the euro area, and some countries are doing actually better than that, in excess of 80%. That has been a significant boost for growth and it has helped governments not go back to the stringent containment measures that we had seen previously.  In the United States, as you probably know from your time in the United States and the IMF – as you were the Head of the IMF – there are some people who are resisting getting vaccinations. There's a political divide in the United States. Some people just think it's not a good thing to do for whatever reason, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of progress getting those people to change. Is there a similar problem in Europe or does everybody want to get vaccinated and it's just a question of taking time to do it?  It varies from country to country and you do have a marginal portion of the population that has the same sentiment about vaccines and about the dangers of vaccines. But I would say that it's probably less so in Europe than in the United States. I understand that the US is 64% into adult vaccination. Europe is now at 70% and going towards higher numbers. So we'll see, but there is a very strong campaign to support vaccination and to really understand the correlation between vaccination and economic recovery.  Do you see many Americans coming now to Europe for tourism purposes or business? Or is it not yet where it was before COVID?  You know, we have seen over the summer quite a few Americans coming back to Europe, doing their regular luxury shopping. I know that the luxury business and the tourism business has been enjoying a renewed boost of activity as a result of tourists visiting European countries and cities in particular. But we're not there yet.  During COVID, were you working remotely? Were you running the European Central Bank from one of your homes, or from a home somewhere? Or were you really going into the office?  I spent quite a few weeks stuck in my Frankfurt apartment during the first wave of COVID, and actually the very sizeable package that we put together for monetary policy purposes was engineered around my kitchen table. Subsequently, when travelling was more flexible and we could move out, then I went to the office a bit but in the main, the by default solution is remote working, still, today – and probably until the end of January. Then we will see.  Well, you should take that kitchen table and move it to your office! Obviously it was very productive, right? Let me ask you: post-COVID do you expect Europeans will go back to work at the same levels as before in terms of going to work five days a week? Or will people work four days a week, one day remotely, or just four days a week of work?  First of all we should all acknowledge that there are people who do not have the luxury of choice, that have to go to work because their physical presence is required. You think about hospital staff, you think about construction workers, you think about some people working in shops. They don't have the choice, they have to be on-site and at work and showing up. In offices, I think we are heading towards a hybrid movement, where parts of the week will be spent in the office so that people can meet, can see each other, can hold regular meetings and have face-to-face contact. But the rest of the week will likely be working from home, so whether it's 50%/50%, whether it's 40%/60% is up for debate and is going to be handled at company levels, I suppose, because most of the legal constraints have been lifted at this point in time. But people have learned during the pandemic, and those learnings will be used for future ways of working.  In the United States – not just to cite the United States all the time, but it's the country I'm most familiar with – we've had some challenges during COVID that people who were minorities, often women, people of lower income strata, they couldn't get access to broadband. They didn't have that, and they had childcare problems and so forth, and it's thought that they fell further and further behind. Did you find the same phenomenon in Europe where minorities, women, people who don't have education fell further and further behind the general population?  Yes, this has been the case in Europe as well, where inequalities in terms of opportunities, in terms of facilities have been aggravated and probably exacerbated by COVID-19 for the reasons that you've mentioned. Those people worst hit by the pandemic were women, were young people, were people on fixed-term and temp contracts, and those were more remote from work than the others. If you look at those who lost their jobs, it's predominantly those women and young people in particular in disproportionate amounts relative to the others.  Around the kitchen table that we just made famous, that you were talking about, you put together a package that was designed to make Europe solve its economic problems as it dealt with COVID. The United States had a similar package. In hindsight, would you say the package worked as well as you thought, not as well, or better than you thought?  When we put it together, we were hopeful that it would work, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and it was a matter of days before we really appreciated that the message was received, fiscal authorities began to act in tandem and in good coordination as well. I think the impacts of Next Generation EU, when all the Europeans decided to go and borrow together jointly, this entire package actually responded well and fast and big to the unbelievable crisis situation that we faced. So all in all, I think it worked well and certainly we responded, I think, faster and better than we had in 2008 and then in 2011 in the European sovereign debt crisis.  Now, the European Central Bank – like the Federal Reserve and like central banks everywhere – they were set up, among other things, to make sure that people don't have too much inflation; that you have a solid currency and you don't have too much inflation. As it turns out, for the last decade or so, many central banks have had to worry about getting inflation because inflation has been so low. Recently, you said that you would like to have a goal, a target of getting 2% inflation. Why has it been so difficult to get to that level for the last five, six, seven years or so in Europe? How confident are you that you can get to 2%?  I think there are multiple reasons for that, but certainly what we decided to do was to have a target which was simple, which was easy to understand, that was symmetric and that also was focused on the medium term. Those were the three attributes. So instead of having that complicated “below, but close to, 2%”, which was a bit uncertain and fuzzy, and which included somehow an implied bias, we decided that we would go for something straightforward, simple; 2% symmetric. So, deviations up or down from 2% are equally undesirable; that's the definition that we have agreed upon. We are also on this medium term, which matters most because we are particularly concerned about inflation expectations. I think that that decision, plus the forward guidance that we also decided a few weeks after the strategy review of the European Central Bank was released, was convincing enough so that markets and analysts and observers have appreciated that we are serious, we mean business, we want 2%.  There are lots of subtleties around the 2% and the lower bound, which leads us to having a more forceful response in some instances, but yes, we mean business and we mean 2%, for sure.  Now, the European Central Bank is unique in one respect: it's a central bank but it doesn't really control the fiscal policies of the various countries that make up Europe. In the United States, obviously we have one government and while the government is often fighting with different parts of the government, you do have one fiscal policy eventually for a country, and you have one monetary policy. How difficult is it to create monetary policy when you can't control the fiscal policy?  You know, what we've learned from this crisis is that when monetary policy and fiscal policy work hand in hand, as they did during the post-COVID response, it's incredibly efficient. I hope that fiscal authorities in this part of the world will also learn from that moment to appreciate how important it is to coordinate well and to join their efforts at the national and at the regional European level in order to respond, and to work. We are not dependent on each other; we complement each other, monetary and fiscal. That has worked incredibly well in this instance.  Before, as I mentioned, you were the Head of the IMF. You served two terms as the Head of the IMF and you could've served another term if you'd wanted to do so. How do you compare the pleasure of running the IMF with the pleasure of running the European Central Bank? Is one more enjoyable than the other, or is one less enjoyable than the other? Or basically, they're both great jobs and you're happy you've had both of them?  I'm extremely privileged to have had the role that I had as Head of the IMF. We saw each other quite often in those days and you know how much I put my heart, my brain and my whole energy into the job, and I've enjoyed it tremendously. I'm doing the same thing with the ECB and I'm doing the same thing on the European scene. In times when you see dual political opposition, in times when you see some energy withdrawn behind borders, it's important to have this desire to unite and to bring consensus to the table and to convince people that what we are doing together, united, is going to be stronger than what we will do individually in our little corners. So, I’m enjoying what I'm doing as well. It's hard, let's face it, but I'm enjoying it.  Now, when you were the Head of the IMF, you were the first woman to hold that position. Now you're the first woman to hold the position of the Head of the European Central Bank. So you've obviously broken through in many cases. You're also the head of your law firm and you're the first woman to head your law firm, a large international law firm. At this point in your life, do you feel discrimination against you in your professional life as a woman? Or do you think discrimination generally has receded against women in the professional workplace?  I think discrimination has not receded, and I don't want to take my personal situation because when you've travelled the journey I have travelled, it's difficult to hold open discrimination against me, let's face it. But I am very, very much aware of discrimination against many women, many young women, many women in all parts of the world. I'm sorry to say, I'm particularly thinking of the Afghan women at the moment, who clearly are suffering the worst possible nightmare and setback in their history and in their life. So it's a constant struggle. It should be a constant fight for all of us to make sure that everybody has a chance to accomplish their talent and to develop their activity in the way they want. This is certainly not the case yet. When I sit at my Governing Council table and I look around, I see 23 men and one woman, in addition to me. Two to 23 is not a very good ratio, and in the finance world – I don't know whether you would call it discrimination – but there is certainly disparity between men and women. If you look at the venture capital world, it's the same. If you look at CEOs of large international banks, it's the same. If you look at parliaments, you have a much lower representation of women than there are women in society, so something is not working.  Well, I certainly understand your point of view, but some people might say it takes 23 men to equal you!  Flattery will get you nowhere. But it's a nice try, thank you!  Let's talk about what central bankers are supposed to do, which is to have the currency be stable and so forth and have interest rates at affordable levels and those kinds of issues. In recent years, central banks have been worrying about something called climate change. The Federal Reserve is making comments about it and you are as well. Why should central bankers be worried about climate change? Is that something that's really within your purview?  The mandate of our central bank in Europe is price stability, and I think governments, parliaments, regulators have to be driving the bus of the fight against climate change. It's their main responsibility. But we are all on that bus and we all have to ask ourselves within the parameters of our respective mandates: should I be concerned? Is there something that I can do about it? This is what the Governing Council of the ECB decided to do, and included climate change as part of its strategy review key considerations. We decided that, yes, climate change actually mattered for price stability. Yes, climate change mattered for the right assessment of risks that we hold in our balance sheet; that disclosure of exposure mattered for proper pricing of risk relating to assets. For all these reasons, we believe that it's part of our primary mandate, price stability, and also of our secondary mandate, which includes other matters. To me, it's a no-brainer consideration. Climate change is part and parcel of our mandate. Think about it: drought, famine, pandemic, flood, massive fires. All of that is going to have an impact on prices, hence on inflation, hence on price stability. If you look at risks, not only do we talk about stranded assets but we also have to talk about the transition cost that many, many companies are going to face in order to move from the business they conduct today to how they should conduct their business tomorrow, let alone the new products that they will have to come up with.  For hundreds of years, governments and central banks have issued currency and the currency is used for things – to buy things, sell things and so forth, and to price assets. Now some people have come along and invented various things called cryptocurrencies. Central banks are trying to adjust to what that means for them, so do you think that cryptocurrencies are a plus for the global economy or is it too early to tell?  Cryptos are not currencies, full stop. Cryptos are highly speculative assets that claim their fame as currency, possibly, but they are not. I think we have to distinguish between cryptos that are those highly speculative, suspicious occasionally – and high intensity in terms of energy consumption – assets, but they are not a currency. On the other hand, you have those stablecoins that are beginning to proliferate, which some big techs are trying to promote and push along the way, which are a different animal and need to be regulated, where there has to be oversight that corresponds to the business that they are actually conducting, irrespective of how they named themselves. In all that, you have the central banks, who are prompted by customer demand to produce something that will make the central bank and central bank currencies fit for the century we are in, which is why we are now looking at CBDCs – central bank digital currencies. Instead of having banknotes and cash in our pockets or in our wallet, we can have exactly the same thing but in a digital form. All of us are working on this and I was certainly keen to push the CBDC issue on our agenda because I believe that we have to stand ready for that.  If the ECB – like the Federal Reserve which is also looking at it – were to have a digital currency, would that be to the exclusion of paper currencies, or would it be side by side?  Side by side, because we want customers to have their preference. If they still want to hold those banknotes and cash, fine, then it should continue to be available and around.  Now, some people talk about a cashless society, which is to say get rid of all paper currencies. In your view, is that just too far in the future or not desirable?  I think people should have options. There are countries that are very close to cashless situations. If you look at countries like Sweden, and to a lesser extent the Netherlands, a lot of transactions are conducted without cash. But it's not necessarily to the advantage, to the benefit of all people. You have some senior citizens in particular who have zero interest in having digital currencies and who still want to operate with cash. That's fine, it should be available. People should have the option.  As you look at the European economy today, what would you say its single biggest challenge is and what would you say its single biggest opportunity is?  I think the single biggest challenge always is to deliver; it's to implement. There are lots of good intentions, but implementation sometimes is hard. I think the second difficult area that will need to be tackled is this issue of inequality, because COVID-19 has aggravated inequalities. The third one is climate change, where we will have to transition probably faster than we think, which will imply a transition cost, which will imply a change in the overall structure of our economies. I would say those three: implementation, inequality and climate change.  The biggest impact on the European economy outside of Europe, is that the United States? Is it China or Asia? What parts of the world outside of Europe have the biggest impact on the European economy, in your view?  I think the biggest impact is the one that we experience with our biggest allies, and our biggest ally in this part of the world is the United States of America.  What has been the impact on the European Central Bank or the European economy, if any, of Brexit? Has it been as bad as some people predicted, or better than people thought? What would you say?  I think the conclusion varies depending on which side of the Channel you are on. From our perspective it's a sad development and we have certainly lost the benefit of excellent formal cooperation with the Bank of England. We try to continue to maintain a good relationship because we have lots of links between us, but in terms of trade it has certainly been a loss – for the UK more so than for Europe. We'll see how it goes. All I can say is that, at this point in time, Europe is coming out of the crisis not with flying colours yet, because a lot of work needs to be done, but more strongly than we had expected. I think the UK is having a more difficult time at the moment.  Part of the way you helped deal with the situation in Europe during COVID was that you had the package that you referred to, a very large financial stability package, but that package really involves countries borrowing money against their own abilities to pay it back. You are in effect not a guarantor but you are making certain that they probably won't default. Are you worried about too much debt among European countries, too much debt in France or Germany or Italy? Or is that not a big problem right now?  You know, I think all countries around the world increased and had to increase their debt relative to GDP, and when you have this high debt increase and a big fall in GDP, of course you end up with those ratios that look higher – and are higher – than what they experienced before. But there was no option and no choice but to do that. Had it not happened, I think the story of the pandemic would have been a lot worse than what we have seen. Now it's a question of directing the financing to the right investment, making sure that the economies are going to bounce back in the right shape, with the right structural reforms that will improve the productivity of those economies, that will position them to be more digital and to be greener. I believe that this Next Generation EU, which was voted on a year ago now, is going to help with making countries better converge and reduce the gap that existed between some of the southern European countries and the northern European countries. That is certainly the intention.  Central bankers are famous for not talking in language that the average person can understand generally; sometimes they've done that on purpose. You talk in a language that everybody seems to understand, it's very simple and so forth. Is that a conscious policy that you have, to make what you're doing understandable to the average person?  Yes. I think it's extremely important that people understand what we are doing. A lot has to do with trust. If somebody talks to you in a completely obscure and “jargonic” language, how are you going to trust that person? To me, it was critically important to agree with the Governing Council members that we would communicate in a more understandable, clearer and simpler way. So just to give you an example, after each Governing Council we issue a monetary policy statement. Well, we committed to keep sentences short, to have one idea per sentence, to make sure that the words that we use are understandable by – you, of course – but the normal person as well. We measure that and we try to stick to those principles and will be held accountable.  Do you think your ability to do that – and the Federal Reserve Chairman, J. Powell, is interested in that as well – both of you are trained as lawyers, so do you think that lawyers… I'm trained as a lawyer, too; do you think there is a greater future for central bankers to be headed by or to be lawyers, and there's some hope for me to be a central banker someday? Or not really?  Well, I'm sure you would thrive! I strongly believe in diversity, as you know, and diversity is not all to do with gender, with minority, with sexual orientation or whatever. It also has to do with the background, with the training, with the culture that you carry with you, and to bring it all together around a table with diversity, in my view, improves the quality of the decisions that we make. I learn a lot from my colleagues, brilliant economists, and I hope they can be patient with us poor lawyers!  I would like to know, what is the pleasure of being the Head of the Central Bank? You obviously have to work seven days a week; you did that for many years in your career with the IMF as well. What is the pleasure you get out of heading the European Central Bank?  It is the same kind of pleasure that I take in leading other organisations; it's making sure that people around me are doing the best they can for the organisation, are delivering on their mission, and that we form a team heading in the same direction. So that to me means an awful lot.  Do you believe that people in your position or senior government people or senior corporate executives should be making statements about public policy issues? Historically, CEOs have just worried about their shareholders. Increasingly, some CEOs are dealing with public policy issues. Are those things that you think CEOs should be doing? Should they be talking about climate change or gender discrimination, or should they just stick to worrying about stockholder returns?  I think they should worry about all these matters that you discussed. I believe in this stakeholder appreciation where you have to account for your shareholders, your employees, the environment in which you operate, the community to which you also return dividends. Corporates are not bodies: they don't have a soul, they are not physical persons but they are acting in people's lives and they are acting in the environment. CEOs should address those matters, yes – and more and more of them actually do, which is good.  My final question is really this: in your youth you were a synchronised swimmer, where you have to, I guess, work very closely with teammates and get everything working together quite nicely. Is it the case that when you're doing the central banking role, you have to have the same kind of skillset? You've got all these central bankers of each country. You have to get them to work together, so do you think your synchronised swimming skills actually come to help you as the Head of the European Central Bank?  Yes, they do actually because what you learn in synchronised swimming is that if each individual is brilliant, it's great, but if they don't work together you will not get the gold medal. Working together as a team actually matters enormously and I have tried, and I will try to continue doing so.   "
2021-09-01,Christine Lagarde,Interview with TIME,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, on 30 August 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with TIME   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, on 30 August 2021 1 September 2021  I'm Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum. And I have the great pleasure to have a discussion today with the President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde. President Lagarde, I think we met for the first time just about 20 years ago, and you were a very prominent lawyer at the time. In the meantime, you have developed also a career as a politician, as an economist, as a statesman, and as a banker.   Knowing and admiring your global perspectives and, I would say, your global responsibilities, I would like to concentrate our discussion on what I consider the four foremost challenges we are faced with at this present time: COVID-19 of course, climate change, inclusion and especially gender parity, and finally, the fourth industrial revolution — how well we can harness new technologies in order so they can serve and not harm humanity.   If I may turn to the first subject, COVID, which, of course has determined our lives, and has had tragic consequences for many people. We are now in some way, at a crossroads because while there is so much vaccination, there are still many question marks. So my question would be: how do you see the road back to normal, if any new normal exists?   And also, if I could raise one issue related to your function in the fight against COVID, what is the role of the central banks? We have heard about the IMF and the special drawing rights which may be used to mobilize $50 billion, but what is your view of the road back to normal?  Thank you so much, Klaus. Yes, it's been 20 years of happy journeys together, where we have crossed paths many times, and looked at the world as it goes, and tried to work out ways to improve it if we could. And I'd like to salute your efforts in that journey. To turn to your question about COVID, and your use of the term “return to normal.” Let me take us back to what we have gone through in the past two years, because I think that is actually going to determine how we transition towards a new way of conducting ourselves, in all respects. We have gone through a massive shock to the global economy, that hit us in the face and actually made us realize that health mattered actually a lot more than the economy and finance, at least in the short term. And there was clearly, as opposed to back during the great financial crisis in 2008, a determination to focus on restoring health, securing income for people whenever that was possible, and trying to cure the pandemic that had just fallen on the world. Of course, there were a few hiccups to begin with. But overall, policymakers did a good job of addressing the issues by reacting very promptly, and very forcefully. And certainly — because you asked about the European Central Bank and what central banks can do — with a massive response in terms of liquidity, in terms of availability of currencies that were sought by all economic players, and in terms of sustainability of those plans to help with the financing of the economy. So one thing which I take some confidence in, is that we learned from the previous crisis. We learned that we could not procrastinate, we learned that we could not go slow, we learned that we could not face inwards. We learned the hard way at the time. You know that saying in the stock market, that you either go big or you go home? Well, we certainly all went big, in order to fight what was happening. By the same token, we adopted very strange measures, you know — locking down, and shutting down our economies, these almost mediaeval ways of dealing with this pandemic. And then, thanks in many ways to globalization — and I'll be happy to expand on that — we came up in next to no time with vaccines, which is something that was unheard of. From a pandemic that started in February, we had vaccines available in December. Typically, it takes more than five years to experiment and create a successful vaccine. This time, it was nine months, as opposed to five years. And this is largely a story of globalization. So, number one we learned from past mistakes, and that we needed to go big and go fast. Number two, we benefited from globalization and came up with vaccines very quickly. We are emerging from this pandemic, with economies that are stabilized, with, in a way, little sustained disruption. When you look at the unemployment levels in advanced economies, not much damage has remained from the pandemic. When you look at the level of GDP, the size of our economies, we will be back to where we were pre-pandemic at the end of the year. So, we really fought hard and responded well, and have come out now with a situation which still needs a lot of attention. But it seems to me now that policymakers have to be almost surgical — it's no longer a question of massive support, it's going to be a question of focused, targeted support in those sectors that have been badly hurt. In addition to supporting the recovery, we must vaccinate. If we don't vaccinate the whole world, as we should, COVID-19 will come back to haunt us, and it will come back to hurt us. To do that, the world needs to be a little bit more generous. And in being generous, it will be serving its own interest. As you know, I am baffled by the fact that the entire global community cannot put together $50 billion in order to address vaccination in those countries of the world where only 2% of the population is vaccinated - I mean the low income countries. We have spent, in fiscal support, something like $6,000 billion — what is needed is 1% of that in order to vaccinate the world. So I think that to move to this new normal, whether one likes the word or not, we need to anticipate and vaccinate and then we need to learn the lessons of what we have just gone through. I think the world that we will live in, will bear the stigmas of COVID. By that, I mean, we will not travel in the same way, as opportunistically and as randomly as we did. We probably will not socialize in the same way, as close to each other. And we will probably shift to better protection of biodiversity and better protection of the climate than otherwise we would have had. So I genuinely hope and think that COVID-19, that has hurt so many of us and has made so much hardship in the world, is going to teach us a few lessons for the future, and will help us move faster on what I think are the priorities for tomorrow.  Christine, you mentioned that we have to learn from surprises like this, and we have to think big and act fast. Now, you could apply the same principle to climate change. And if we look at the latest IPCC report, we are not any more in a situation where we can fight climate change. We may have already caused irreversible damage to our planet. My question would be, what can institutions like the ECB and also central banks do to make monetary policy really contribute to a healthier life and wholesome planet?   And actually, what would be the implications of the fight against climate change and preserving nature and biodiversity for our economic model? Many people are afraid it costs us, and it comes with a reduction of our lifestyle and our quality of life. Can we combine the drive towards a green economy with economic cost?  Those are great questions. Let me address the first one. What role can central banks play in the fight against climate change? And that's a highly controversial issue. There are some traditional thinkers who believe that central banks should altogether stay out of that business and exclusively concentrate on inflation, and price stability. I strongly disagree with that myself. At the ECB, we have now wrapped up and concluded our strategy review, which was the first one in 17 years. And I was blessed to have an entire Governing Council unanimously agree that the fight against climate change should be one of the considerations that we take when we determine monetary policy. So at least the European Central Bank is of the view that climate change is an important component in order to decide on monetary policy. Why is that? Because obviously, climate change has an impact on price stability. I'll give you one very simple example that happens in the financial sector, actually. To guard against many of the climate change consequences that we will suffer, economic actors are going to have to take out much higher insurance coverage. Insurance premiums will rise, and so insurance companies will have to deploy their activities differently. And that's only an example from the financial sector. If I look at droughts, if I look at farming, if I look at the rising level of seas, and so on and so forth, it will have an impact on agricultural production, it will have an impact on where people live, it will have an impact on not only the way we live, but the cost of living, and that clearly has to be embedded into the analysis that we conduct. A second observation: Climate change does have an impact on the valuation of assets because it inflicts a risk on companies. Not just the assets that they hold, but also the products that they produce. And this is not yet very well recorded at the moment. So one could argue that without proper disclosure and information about those risks, assets are likely to be mispriced and poorly recorded. From an accounting point of view, they should take into account future profits as well as risks that apply. Many central banks, not all of them but many of them, hold corporate bonds. Are those assets well-priced? Should they be better identified, together with the risks that they carry? That's the second reason. Read more: IMF Chief Kristalina Georgieva Says We Have a 'Once in a Century Opportunity' to Fund a Sustainable Future Having said that, I'm also very prepared to recognize that the key actors in the fight against climate change and the preservation of biodiversity are not central banks. There are parliaments, there are governments, there are regulators who have to decide and who have to convince the public that these matters actually impact their life, and must be taken into account. And sometimes hard decisions have to be made, such as pricing carbon emissions, such as regulating activity, in ways that will make certain things more expensive. And that takes me to your second question. Can we arrive at that trade-off between fighting climate change, preserving biodiversity and yet securing enough growth to respond to legitimate demands of the population? And my first answer, Klaus, to be firm, is that to have a way of life, we need life. And in the medium term, we do have major threats on the horizon that could cause the death of hundreds of thousands of people. So we have to think life, first. We have to think way of life, second. How can we come together to make sure that we secure the first priority, which is life, and also protect the way of life that people have? And make sure that the cost of it is not so high for some people, that they just cannot tolerate it. I think that the trade-off that we reach will probably require some redistribution, because it is clear that the most exposed people, the less privileged people are those that are going to need some help. And under the Paris Agreement, back in 2015, it was decided that all nations would put together a pot of $100 billion in order to help least developed countries adapt to climate change. But that hasn't yet happened. And it was due in 2020. Now, granted, COVID-19 happened, we probably have one or two years extension. But according to U.N. calculations, we are still at $79 billion and not 100 billion that should be made available to least developed countries.  Christine, you spoke about life. I'm very often thinking that my grandchildren’s life expectancy will be such that they are around hopefully at the transition to the next century. And when I look at global warming, I become aware of what responsibility we really have. And the same goes for inequality, another global problem which needs urgent attention.   We have seen that a tendency towards inequality was already with us before COVID and has been tremendously accelerated. And some people would even say that the necessary fiscal and monetary policies of the past 18 months contributed to a certain extent to increase inequality. But on the other hand, they helped to save workplaces.   So the question is open — a number of factors are difficult, conceptually. It’s a complex issue. We have structural changes in industry with the move towards platform companies. We have economic inequality among individuals in a post pandemic economy, defined by increased digitalization and flexibility. And we also, of course, have the fact that many people dropped out of the labor force, or remain unemployed. And yet in some countries, we have as many open positions as we have unemployed people.   So it's a mismatch between skills and probably we have to do much more in order to reskill and upskill people. From your position: How would you contribute to address this issue of inequality?  I like the way you put your question Klaus, because I think that the jury's out as to whether or not the monetary and fiscal support that were provided during the COVID crisis, actually exacerbated inequalities or reduced inequalities that obviously have not arisen if they have been properly addressed. I'm talking here about the jobs lost, the closed factories, the reduced income — all of that, I think, has been well addressed by fiscal and monetary authorities around the world. So let's put that aside, I tend to believe for myself that central banks had to do what they had to do, and had they not put in place those massive plans of liquidity supply and support, we would have been in a worse-off situation, which would have hurt the less privileged more, the most exposed and the poorest people, because they would have been the first ones to lose out. I don’t say that to give us a good conscience as central bankers, but I think that we unfortunately have to deal with counterfactuals. So how can we contribute going forward to reducing those inequalities? We will continue to support the economy, we will continue to guarantee and to procure price stability, we will continue to be focused on our mission. And that will not be enough to reduce inequalities. You know, Klaus, I'm particularly attentive to the inequalities that are suffered by women. During the COVID crisis, those that suffered most actually were women. They were the ones most exposed to COVID because they were in the caring and the nursing and hospital sectors. They were the ones on the frontline in the lower skilled and lower paid jobs. And when the choice was between the man and the woman at home, to stay at home to look after the elderly, or the young kids, often it was the woman who stayed at home. So my hope is that we all recognize that the upskilling and reskilling programmes are necessary going forward in order to adjust to this, these new forms of conducting business, we can actually give a special benefit to those who were most affected, including in particular women. I'm convinced that when given the opportunity to reskill and to skill up in order to readjust into the economy, women will actually thrive and they will want to do that. I have no idea from a constitutional standpoint in many countries whether that can be achieved because there's generally the principle of equal access, equal opportunities and all the rest of it. And we know that the situation is not that equal. But how we can give women a better chance because they were worse off during the COVID crisis is an area that we should explore. It is still mindboggling that in the OECD countries, there is still a major wage gap, and the World Economic Forum index that determines how close or far we are from equality clearly indicates that we are far away from reaching this equal wage, equal opportunity, equal access to education for women around the world.  I fully agree with you that central banks and fiscal authorities had no other choice but to act. And sometimes you have to deal afterwards with the unintended or unforeseen consequences or negative outflows of such decisions.   But coming back to gender parity, I want to ask you, maybe a personal question or two personal questions. The first one is, when we look at women in leadership positions, we see relatively few in the financial sector, compared to the rest of the economy. So, what can be done in order to make sure that we have more women in the banking and financial community in leadership positions?   And the second one, which is a more personal one: What are the greatest lessons you have learned? I mean, you are a woman who made it to the top of the IMF, in the French government and the ECB. How would you tell a woman that they can make the progress they deserve, in spite of the still prevailing systemic discrimination women face?  Thank you, Klaus for that question on women in finance. Just a few numbers to begin with, because often, we just underestimate the situation. If you look around the world banking system, only 3% of CEOs of banks are women. When you look just at Europe, and take into account banks and all financial institutions, it’s still less than 9% of CEOs, or presidents who are women. That's an abysmally small number. If you consider on the other hand, that in the household at home, those who in most instances control finances, are women. So there is an insidious chip on their shoulders that stops them from moving into finance and into banking and into the financial world in general. When they do go into that world, they do extremely well. There have been studies to show that women are better risk assessors, and their performance is at least equal to that that of men. So what trigger would it take for them to go into finance? Honestly, I don't know. I think just like in other sectors, it's going to be a combination: of self-confidence – badly needed; role models – in very short supply at the moment; and education, and I think on that particular front there should be scholarships, there should be support, there should be special incentives put in place in order to encourage young girls to go into math, to go into sciences in general, because they are underrepresented later on in life, in finance, but also in technology, and in economics. And those are fields where sciences, maths, technology, are the grassroots of the education system. So it's really a massive effort that is needed, but incentives, scholarships, anything that works should be used. At the European Central Bank, we have a special scholarship that we've put in place for women to take a master’s degree in economics, and it works. We are really recruiting exceptionally talented woman. So money talks, often. Scholarships, incentives, all of that must be put in place in order to bring them into the fold. Because we cannot have a world where half the population is represented by only 3%. And to your second question, what was most helpful to me personally? I'm sorry to say, but I think it's love. That was most helpful to me. Because the love that I received from parents, family, husbands, children, has actually given me the confidence to ignore some of the noises that I heard along the way. And confidence matters enormously. When you shift from one area of work to another area of work, you think to yourself, can I actually do it? And women often ask themselves, can I do it? Men rarely do. They take the challenge. They go with it. They don't prepare as much, but they don't doubt themselves to begin with. In many instances, women doubt themselves to begin with, and I've spoken to many, many of them. So I won't say love is the way but love is one good nutrient for confidence, which itself is critical in order to take risks. And yes, I did take risk in my life, professionally.  Christine, you emphasize self-confidence. But I would also say I think we should have more trust in women. I will confess that all my financial affairs are in the hands of my wife. I haven’t made any bank transactions in the past twenty years. And I’m not doing too badly with it!   So we’ve addressed the big issues. We’ve spoken about COVID-19, we’ve spoken about the climate crisis, and about inequality. As you know, my particular concern, having coined this notion of a fourth industrial revolution, is how do we use technology to the benefit of mankind, and how do we cooperate together on a global level. And I want to focus on one aspect of this revolution which is digital currencies — or should I say, decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin.   What is your stance on these decentralized currencies? Can they contribute to financial stability, in your opinion, or are they are a threat? And if I remember well you have suggested that the ECB might create a digital currency in the next four years — what would be the benefits of such a move, and what might the pitfalls be? Would it strengthen or weaken the position of the euro on a global level?  I wish we had another hour, Klaus, for that one! But I'll try to zoom in on a few things. Number one, I think that all cryptocurrencies alleged to be cryptocurrencies are not currencies at all. They are speculative assets, the valuation of which changes over the course of time. They present themselves as currencies, which they are not. So I think that we should all in the finance sector and at the regulatory level, call a spade a spade. An asset is an asset and has to be regulated as such, it has to be supervised by the asset regulators and supervisors, but should not claim that it is a currency; it is not. The second category is stable coins. These are devices that have been invented by some of the big technology companies, Facebook is certainly a leading example. There are many others around as well. Stable coins are pretending to be a coin but in fact, it's completely associated with an actual currency. For instance, some of them are saying that they can be used for transactions, but the value will be exactly aligned to the dollar. Fine, but again, let's call a spade a spade. If it is, so then [the coin issuers] have to also guarantee to those holding coins that they can exchange those coins for dollars. And therefore, those coin issuers should have to back up their coins with as many dollars as they have coins. That needs to be checked, supervised, and regulated, so that consumers and users of those devices can actually be guaranteed against potential misrepresentation. I think very recent history has showed that those reserve currencies were not always available and as liquid as they were intended to be. Third is the digital currencies that the Central Bank of China has been experimenting upon for the last seven years, and which the ECB has decided to experiment upon for the next two years before it makes final decision to go ahead with it. The Bank of England is looking at the same kind of approach, and the Fed will soon be issuing a paper to determine which way it goes. At the European Central Bank, we believe that we should be ready and have the technology available in order to respond to customer demands. If customers prefer to use digital currency rather than have bank notes and cash available, it should be available. And we should respond to that demand. And make sure that we have a solution that is European based, that is secure, that is available under friendly terms, that can be used as a means of payment at reasonable terms as well and does not jeopardize the whole banking system, which should be part and parcel of the proposal. So that's the reason why we've decided to go ahead with a two year experiment to ensure that we can actually respond to that demand: Availability, just as cash is available and will continue to be available, but it will be a consumer’s preference; the safety and security of the device; user friendliness; cheap cost; and ways of transacting business that will be recognized and accepted not only in the euro area, but around the world.  Thank you, Christine, for this clarification, because I think there's a lot of ignorance about these new types of coins or currencies. I think we have really explored today some of the great issues and I think you have clarified some issues also. The central banks are considered to be a very abstract institution, which affect our lives only in indirect ways, but I believe you have shown that it is very important to have leadership of central banks, which really contribute to making this world a better world. And I think you are taking the lead. Thank you very much not only for participating in this dialogue, but also for taking the lead for improving the state of the world.  Thank you so much Klaus.

2021-09-01,Luis de Guindos,Interview with El Confidencial,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Miquel Roig and Jorge Zuloaga on 26 August and published on 1 September 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with El Confidencial   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Miquel Roig and Jorge Zuloaga on 26 August and published on 1 September 2021 1 September 2021  You are almost halfway through your term as Vice-President of the ECB. How would you assess your term so far, and what aims do you have for the second half?  These three years have been extremely interesting, and they have been marked, above all else, by the pandemic – an extraordinary event that has sparked an enormous health crisis. It had an extremely severe economic impact in a short space of time, which required an unprecedented economic and monetary policy response. The next 18 to 24 months will be defined by attempts to leave the economic consequences of the pandemic behind us and to minimise its structural impact. That will be the main objective.  I thought you might be a little more optimistic, but it seems you are happy with mitigating the consequences and going back to where we were before.  Some of the short-term impact has been successfully mitigated, but the pandemic will have had structural effects on the European and world economies. The fiscal effects will be the most apparent, with the euro area’s average debt-to-GDP ratio 20 percentage points higher and more pronounced structural deficits. There is also other scarring, which could be structural, in the job market, as well as greater inequality between advanced and emerging economies. The pandemic has had a greater impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, low-income workers and women.  In such an environment, do you think the economy is ready for a gradual withdrawal of asset purchases?  I was talking about the medium term in what I just said. The ECB’s primary response to the crisis consisted of action in three different areas. The first focused on liquidity, through the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTROs, supporting banks’ credit provision to households and firms. The second focused on asset purchases through our emergency [purchase] programme. And the third focused on changes in the field of banking supervision to enable banks to free up capital and increase their lending capacity. These measures were crucial to averting a debt crisis. Bond market fragmentation has been avoided, and we have ensured that financing conditions remain favourable. Future monetary policy decisions will essentially depend on how the economy and inflation develop in the coming months.  But with that in mind, is it not too early to determine whether or not the European economy is ready for the emergency purchases to be withdrawn?  The monetary policy measures were intended to limit the impact of the pandemic on the economy, maintain favourable financing conditions and ensure we met our inflation target. Looking at the European economy, you can see that the recovery was very strong in the second quarter, and we believe it will continue to be fairly strong in the third and fourth quarters. Our emergency [purchase] programme is linked to the pandemic and its economic consequences. But one thing is clear: recent data are very positive. The European economy will be able to recover its pre-pandemic income levels by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. We will have new projections in the coming days and will take our decisions accordingly. In September we will also have to decide on the volume of purchases for the last quarter of this year. If inflation and the economy recover, then there will logically be a gradual normalisation of monetary policy, and of fiscal policy too.  Up until now, you have said that we would reach pre-COVID income levels in the first quarter of 2022. Is it the improving economic forecasts that are now leading you to say this could happen by the end of the year?  It is a nuanced issue – we are talking about just a few months. The economy is performing better in 2021 than we expected, and this will be reflected in the projections that will be published in the coming days. The leading indicators are positive, and in the coming days we will see the actual figures. The main uncertainty was the impact the Delta variant would have. What we are seeing is that it is not having as great an impact as we projected four months ago. This is mainly because governments have responded with fewer restrictions on economic activity than we had anticipated.  Does this improvement in the projections also apply to Spain?  The Spanish economy shrunk by 10.8% in 2020, more than any other euro area economy. So it should logically experience a stronger-than-average recovery. A country’s economic development during the pandemic should be assessed in terms of when it recovers its previous income levels.  What are your expectations for inflation growth?  Inflation will continue to pick up in 2021. Our baseline scenario is that it will fall back in 2022. We have to check that there are no second-round effects, because that would mean this temporary impact would become structural.  What is the ECB’s assessment of the measures governments have taken to soften the impact of the crisis? Did they get it right, or have they gone too far?  In terms of fiscal policy, governments acted in a very similar manner. First, they provided public guarantees, so credit continued to flow. Second, they granted moratoria, which have also had a positive impact. And third, the temporary layoff schemes that have been introduced in various countries have also been very effective. These measures have taken the sting out of the crisis, the impact of which has been greater on GDP than on employment. In Europe, GDP fell by 7%, but employment by just 2%. However, if we look at the figures for hours worked, the fall was greater.  Were any measures missing? Or do you maybe think some measures went too far, like public borrowing?  The measures were appropriate. The rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio was inevitable. Significant action was needed in the realm of fiscal policy. The alternative would have been worse. And at the European level, this time there was a response that stood out: Next Generation EU. European funds, if used well, will be crucial to the recovery.  With the worst of the pandemic over, should steps now be taken to reduce public debt and correct the deficit?  The premature withdrawal of stimulus should be avoided given that the economic situation is still fragile. Some measures are being gradually withdrawn, such as temporary layoff schemes, debt moratoria and loan guarantee schemes. In that respect, we are seeing how fiscal measures are starting to adjust to a certain degree of normalisation. The withdrawal should be prudent, while also avoiding leaving measures in place for too long leading to the creation of moral hazard or the zombification of the European economy.  Nobody is saying that adjustments won’t be necessary, but there are two schools of thought: one is in favour of starting to talk about them already, while the other would prefer to put it off until later. Which do you most identify with?  Once the pandemic and its effects are over, countries are going to find themselves with higher deficits and, more importantly, with much higher levels of public debt. Once the effects of the pandemic are behind us, credible budgetary plans will be required. It will be up to the European Commission to set the pace in this area, since this is a fiscal policy issue. The general escape clause will apply next year, but once pre-pandemic income levels are reached, the Stability and Growth Pact will once again be taken into consideration.   Although fiscal policy is the European Commission’s responsibility, are you not afraid that this increase in public debt could once again raise the issue of the link between sovereign risk and the banking sector?  The pandemic has brought about an increase in budget deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios. It has also led to greater divergence between countries. Those with a debt-to-GDP ratio higher than the European average will have to make a greater effort to rectify this situation through a credible budgetary plan. It’s that simple. The European Commission will decide on the exact form, and in any case, any plan must be implemented gradually and cautiously. At the start of the crisis, one of our main concerns was the risk of a “doom loop”, i.e. the interconnectedness of firms, banks and sovereigns and the risks that could arise from it. Fortunately, these risks did not materialise. The non-performing loan ratio has continued to fall, it has not had an impact on bank balance sheets and credit did not dry up, which would have made the economic situation worse. And this occurred thanks to the fiscal policy measures, the debt moratoria, the government loan guarantee schemes, the liquidity we have provided to banks and the fact that the ECB’s actions have ensured that financing conditions remain favourable.  This is the negative link that has been avoided and that we must continue to avoid. How can we do this? By withdrawing stimulus gradually. There must first be an economic recovery before monetary policy and fiscal policy can return to normal. But obviously we will not always have emergency programmes, since that would mean that we had not put the pandemic and related costs behind us.  All of the ECB’s actions have contributed towards eliminating these negative links. But its actions carry risks as well as benefits. For example, the more stimulus there is, the more difficult it is to withdraw. How dangerous an obstacle is this?  Withdrawal of the extraordinary stimulus measures should be aligned with changes in economic activity levels. If things start to return to normal, as is currently the case, the extraordinary measures will have to be gradually withdrawn. We should monitor economic developments, inflation and economic projections. We will analyse upside and downside risks, then make a decision. We rely on the data. At the end of 2019, before the pandemic, the ECB had its monetary policy and governments had their fiscal policy. When the pandemic is over, we will have to return to using the economic, fiscal and monetary stimulus measures that correspond to a normal economy. We are not there yet, but we are gradually and continually moving towards that point.  The Bundesbank recently renewed its criticism of the ECB’s ultra-loose policy. In the current climate, does this stance worry you?  In a very high percentage of cases, the ECB’s monetary policy was adopted unanimously. This was the case for the pandemic emergency purchase programme. Different points of view do of course exist; there are 25 of us on the Governing Council. Sometimes we take decisions unanimously and other times with a large majority. The strategy review, for example, was adopted unanimously.  We wanted to ask you about that. Some say it is a missed opportunity, others that it goes too far. Do you think it will still be around in another 20 years?  I wouldn’t dare make forecasts for the next 20 years. Besides, we have said that the Governing Council intends to assess periodically the appropriateness of its strategy, and the next assessment will take place in 2025.  But do you see signs that the market thinks that the ECB will be more tolerant about inflation?  It’s not a question of being more tolerant. We have changed the definition of price stability, but that doesn’t mean that in general we will accept a much higher rate of inflation. We have set our target based on a logical development. The inflation target is now 2% over the medium term and not “below, but close to, 2%”, as it was before. That’s not revolutionary. We continue to be fully committed to price stability.  But the definition is more tolerant.  Yes, but that’s a marginal issue. We have said that our target is symmetric, meaning that any negative or positive deviations from the 2% target are equally undesirable. This is important because up until now, the perception was that the ECB acted more forcefully when inflation overshot the target. But we’re not like the Federal Reserve System and we don’t accept inflation compensation. What we have said is that inflation can be temporarily and moderately higher than 2% because current interest rates are zero or close to zero. But that does not mean that in general we have raised our level of acceptance of high inflation.  One of the risks of monetary policy is the development of bubbles in assets such as real estate, which has continued to increase considerably in Spain. Do you see a risk of overheating?  There are certain sectors in the European real estate market, such as residential real estate, where we are seeing prices rising and which we are therefore monitoring. These cases of very specific sectors, which are nevertheless starting to become more common, have to be addressed through macroprudential policy. Monetary policy is not the appropriate tool because it cannot differentiate in that regard.  And, in your view, have the conditions been met for macroprudential buffers to be activated in certain countries?  There were some countries, like Germany or France, which had taken measures such as activating the additional capital buffer. But they deactivated it when the pandemic hit, which makes sense. Once things return to normal, it would also make sense to take measures of this kind if there are instances of overheating.  There have been quite a lot of mergers in Spain. When you were a minister you worked with the idea of there being fewer banks. Do you think there is still scope to work along these lines?  The context is one of low profitability in the banking sector, and consolidation is a tool that can be used to improve profitability through cost savings. But it is a tool and not an end in itself. It’s the market, not the ECB, that takes decisions about bank consolidation. What the ECB has identified – in Europe, not just in Spain – is an environment of low profitability. This has now improved because the level of provisioning hasn’t been as high as it initially might have needed to be. From the structural perspective, Europe is facing a situation of overcapacity and excess costs. And consolidation is a tool that can be used to bring about improvements in those areas.  And in this context of overcapacity and the need to improve profitability, what are your views on the debate in Spain about bank redundancies? Could it get in the way of the improvements needed in terms of profitability?  As ECB Vice-President I can’t comment on that kind of domestic matter. In general, bank consolidation is one of the methods that can help to improve profitability. This sometimes means making adjustments, which can be painful in the short term. But if the adjustments are not made, there’s the possibility of a crisis. Moreover, bank profitability is not only a medium-term problem. It has implications for banks’ ability to generate capital now, and it even ends up affecting their lending capacity. Of course, we must think about measures that might minimise the downside of the necessary adjustments. But, if nothing is done, over time that low profitability ends up becoming a much more structural crisis.  Following the controversy surrounding [the asset management company] Sareb, would you change anything from the 2012 bailout?  The bank bailout allowed Spain to grow [at a rate] above the European average for years and has made it easier for Spanish banks to face the stress tests and the crisis with sufficient levels of solvency. Having said that, there is always room for improvement.   During the latest round of earnings announcements, the banks have been clear that current provisions are more than sufficient, and some even see the right conditions to start releasing some, which goes against the ECB’s message. Have the banks won the battle with the supervisor?  It’s not a matter of battles. A wave of corporate bankruptcies, as was feared in March or April last year, has been successfully averted. But the fact that developments in non-performing loans lag behind economic developments must be taken into account. And this is particularly true in the current circumstances, when there have been moratoria and government guarantees. The current low levels of non-performing loans don’t appropriately reflect what might happen in the coming months. Non-performing loans are going to rise. So from the financial stability and supervisory perspectives, caution is the best approach. Banks will have to adjust those provisions to an increase in non-performing loans due to the significant time lags. The “fallen angels” situation has been avoided, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be an increase in non-performing loans in the coming quarters. And if that happens, provisions will have to be adjusted.  Despite all the attention the ECB has given to stopping reputational issues in the banking sector, they are still very much present, at least in Spain with cases like Villarejo. Does it worry you that there is no end to such cases?  A bank’s main asset is its reputation. The banks themselves have the greatest interest in their reputation being spotless, since their credibility and business depend crucially on the trust that is placed in them.   "
2021-08-25,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt 25 August 2021  Could you give us an update on the outlook for the eurozone economy?  It’s important to differentiate between the first and the second halves of the year. It’s significant that second quarter GDP came in well ahead of our June projections. That reflects an earlier opening up, with many countries opening in the middle of the second quarter and onwards. The strength of the world economy and progress in vaccinations were also important factors.  In terms of the second half of the year, it’s still early days. But there’s probably some counterbalance to that good second quarter. The counterbalance is that it looks like bottlenecks are going to be more persistent than expected. There is also some moderation in the world economy, which is natural. And the Delta variant, although it has a more limited impact than earlier waves, remains a headwind.  If you put all of that together -- the fact that the second quarter came in above what we expected and what the third and fourth quarters might look like -- I would say we’re broadly not too far away from what we expected in June for the full year. It’s a reasonably well-balanced picture.   Does that mean you don’t expect substantial changes in the staff projections in September?  Staff projections are quite comprehensive and it’s too early to make a call on that, but I think I identified the big topics: the fact that the second quarter was ahead of expectations, but there are also some headwinds: more extensive bottlenecks, maybe some slowdown in the world economy and maybe some risk of the Delta variant.   What is the impact of China’s slowdown on the world economy?  The key question is whether it’s an organic slowdown. All economies slow down after the recovery from the pandemic. China went through the cycle earlier, so it’s natural that it would be slowing down at this point. But the real question is whether the extent of the slowdown is bigger than what’s already baked into the projections and I’m not so sure about that.    How is the Delta variant going to affect the economy?  It’s clearly a negative for the recovery in international travel and tourism. It’s a negative for the reopening of high contact domestic sectors as well. But the fact that it has not required more extensive measures and that localised measures have been reasonably effective does indicate that, in terms of the overall economy, the impact is quite limited so far.  The Delta variant is spreading around the world and came to the United States later than to Europe and it’s now part of the mix in the US and global economies. Because of high vaccination rates and prior lockdown measures, Europe may not be among the regions hardest-hit by Delta.  Europe is more the exception now, given the scale of vaccinations and the resolution of the vaccine supply problems. To me, attention may be rotating towards how the world is going to be affected by the next waves of the pandemic, even if Europe itself is going to manage this quite well, I hope. Vaccination is still incomplete, but the infrastructure is there, the system is there and that has eliminated uncertainty about Europe’s ability to carry out vaccinations.  Is it still appropriate to maintain “significantly higher” purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP)?  The overriding aim of purchases is to maintain favourable financing conditions. Favourability is defined by whether financing conditions are sufficiently favourable to make sure we’re countering the negative pandemic shock to inflation.  The other ingredient is what’s happening to financing conditions. Market interest rates have moved down compared to the peak and are now in an intermediate zone: lower than in late spring, but higher than the very low levels we saw at the turn of the year. We’ll have to assess at the September meeting the appropriate calibration for the final quarter of the year, taking into account the movement in market interest rates and the inflation outlook.  But in the grand scheme of things, this is a local adjustment. Throughout the PEPP period, we have had a high rate of purchases. Purchases in the second and third quarters were significantly higher than in the first, but even in the first quarter, compared to historical norms, purchases were pretty high. Any adjustment we make within the pandemic period is within the single philosophy: maintaining favourable financing conditions. If this can be done with lower purchases, we’ll buy less. If favourable financing conditions require more purchases, we’ll conduct more purchases.  September is very far away, even from the earliest conclusion date of PEPP, which is next March. Our commitment to maintaining favourable financing conditions throughout the pandemic crisis phase means that the purchase decision should be viewed as an implementation issue. It’s subordinated to the deeper commitment, which is favourable financing conditions.  Given the drop in yields, couldn’t you maintain favourable financing conditions with lower purchase volumes?  It is a universal aspect of quantitative easing (QE) that today’s yields incorporate market expectations about future purchases. What we have implemented since last December is a dynamic process: we observe what happens in terms of financing conditions, especially market interest rates. We don’t respond day by day, but we did make a conscious decision in March to step up purchases, and we made a conscious decision in June that we should maintain that pace. In the upcoming meetings, whether September or December, we’ll have to take into account the movements in interest rates. Our tolerance for the level of financing conditions depends on how robust the inflation dynamic is looking.  As you said, March 2022 is still quite far off. Should we then expect a discussion in September about what happens in March and beyond? If it’s too early, how much time should markets be given?  Asset purchases will continue after PEPP because we’ll have our regular asset purchase programme (APP) running, as conditions to end APP are not there. That’s why we still have time. If we were in a pure taper situation, going from supporting the market to finishing net purchases, then preparing the market is an issue. But that is not the situation here. Regardless of when PEPP might end, that’s not the end of the ECB’s role in terms of QE. This is why we don’t need a huge lead time to think about it. Of course, we can’t leave it too late either. But six months is quite a lot of time. In the autumn, we’ll have to work through a lot of issues relating to what 2022 should look like.  We already know what we’re doing until March, which is maintaining favourable financing conditions, so we have time this autumn to work out what comes next.  We also know the autumn and the winter will give us further information on what happens to the pandemic, so we should use the autumn to think about these issues.  PEPP will continue until the crisis phase of the pandemic is over. What is your personal definition of the “crisis phase”?  For me, the crisis phase lasts while the downside risk is substantial. What we did last year and continue to do now, is provide a lot of stability. To me, the assessment is whether we’ve seen a sufficient reduction in downside risk that we can be comfortable in moderating policy support. PEPP is a crisis instrument. What we’ve done, along with public health and fiscal action, is to ensure that all sorts of downside scenarios have not come to pass.  At the same time, I’m sure risk tolerance will be something to think about, because you never have zero risk.  With inflation exceeding forecasts in the near term, how much impact will that have on medium-term price pressures?  Let me make a distinction between the expectations of financial traders and the real economy, like firms, worker representatives and households.  We’ve seen significant movements in the beliefs of financial traders, which is quite important because that influences asset prices. Over the course of the year, since the bottom seen last year, one narrative – a kind of pessimism that inflation was locked into a very low trajectory – has been repriced. Over the summer, you’ve also seen a narrative that a new chronically high inflation era is coming. That has by now also been repriced. So, there is a kind of reversion to the middle.  We need to observe whether the inflation readings we’re seeing right now will influence wage negotiations. I don’t see that at the moment, though there is often a lag in the wage negotiation system. You probably need to look across the full pandemic period because a lot of wage negotiations were postponed during the pandemic.  In 2020 inflation came in at 0.3%. In June we predicted that 2021 inflation would be 1.9%. If you put those together, you have an average of 1.1%. That’s broadly where inflation was pre-pandemic. The question is whether there’s going to be a radical shift in wage outcomes.  Does this mean that these near-term upside surprises are not changing your view of inflation in the medium term?  By and large that’s true, our view of subdued inflation pressures for the medium term still holds, but my first point also applies. It does serve to remind everyone that this type of fatalism that inflation will always be very low is being given less weight in markets. But equally, the kind of speculation that we are entering a chronically high inflation period is also seen as less likely.   Inflation expectations have not moved up significantly since you unveiled your new strategy in July. Did the guidance then achieve your goals?  There are two basic points to make. One: in relation to the two per cent symmetric inflation target, what we decided is not a really huge surprise given the discussion in the last several years. So, I’m not sure it should have led to a huge revision in market beliefs. Two: the rate forward guidance was more novel. I think the rate forward guidance will take on increasing importance as time goes by. I don’t think that should be evaluated primarily in terms of the announcement effect because nobody believes we’ll meet the conditions to lift interest rates anytime soon. But it is also true that as inflation goes up in the coming years, the rate forward guidance will provide discipline and strong guidance about our patience. It’s going to play an important role in ruling out speculation that – as the inflation environment improves – we might be tempted into premature tightening. It’s not so relevant now, because we’re not near that zone. But at some point we’ll enter that zone where inflation is rising and it’s moving closer to two per cent.  We understand from your strategy that overshooting the target may happen, but I have not got a firm enough answer on whether the ECB will aim to overshoot. So, just to be sure: is overshooting merely going to be incidental or will it be an aim?  It’s clearly the former and it’s important to recognise this distinction, because it’s a conscious one. To support these kinds of policy choices, for example, the rate forward guidance, we would run all sorts of simulations to assess what inflation would look like under various configurations of the economy. And the intention here is to deliver the two per cent inflation target. But if you keep with the rate forward guidance, it may imply a transitory period of inflation above two per cent. So, we recognise this is possible, we recognise under various simulations that this may well happen. But that is not the orientation. The anchor is two per cent. It is all about delivering two per cent. But to acknowledge that two per cent in the medium term may involve a transitory phase of inflation moderately above two per cent should be basically viewed in a “matter of fact” manner. It’s an implicit possible element of these policies, but it is not the goal.  The Federal Reserve is now openly debating tapering. How will their eventual decision affect the ECB?  The impact on the euro area is really a function of a few different dimensions. One is how much insulation might be provided by the exchange rate. If the exchange rate moves, counterbalancing monetary policy elsewhere, this insulates the euro area from some of those spillovers. In any case, the ECB is not a passive bystander. If there are spillovers to euro area financing conditions, we are willing and able to move as appropriate, as we have already demonstrated.  Of course, it is not a surprise that at some point the United States will end QE. So, it’s all about whether it’s a smooth process, which is already baked into financing conditions, or whether it contains some surprises.  The other basic point is that the US taper decision depends on substantial progress in the US recovery. Substantial progress in the US economy is good news for the world economy, it’s good news for Europe. So, it’s not a kind of random external shock.  Do you think investors are right to expect an increase in APP purchases once PEPP ends?  Whenever PEPP ends and we rely on APP as the primary QE instrument, the driver of policy will be the gap between where inflation is projected and our medium-term two per cent target. Our strategy is crystal clear, we will set monetary policy to deliver on our target in the medium term.  A second consideration is net bond supply. You cannot think about the volume of the APP independently of the volume of net bond supply. The relatively high fiscal deficits that we saw last year and this year will not be lasting in the coming years, but the scale of deficits may remain higher than the pre-pandemic levels. A third element is investor demand: we have seen this year significant shifts in investor demand, and such investor demand shocks are relevant in thinking about the appropriate calibration of net asset purchases. I think we have plenty of time to think about those questions.  What elements of flexibility from the PEPP should be carried over to the APP?  I think it is crystal clear that the parameters for flexibility should be different in normal times compared to a crisis. You can take the view that the ECB has shown that, when necessary, it can design a crisis programme pretty quickly.  The other dimension of flexibility relates to maximising the efficiency of the APP even in normal times. This programme has been around since 2015. We have learned a lot and it has been pretty effective, so there’s value in maintaining a well-seasoned, well-oiled programme. On the other hand, a principle of good governance does mean you take a look at the kind of basic design of any policy every so often.  Do you have any red lines in this flexibility?  Our policy decisions, including those on the design of the APP, should be based on an integrated assessment. Weighing different factors suggests that we should try to minimise the amount of absolute red lines, because we have an overriding price stability mandate to meet, and all characteristics should be assessed on whether they are desirable or interfering with us delivering our mandate. At the same time, of course, all has to be within the legal framework, which in the end is a set of red lines.   How vital is it to keep Greece in QE? It is part of the PEPP but not the APP. Can you foresee changes in your APP eligibility criteria tailored to keep Greece in QE?  There is a general point here: if you have favourable financing conditions, that benefits the bond market in general, not only the bonds we purchase. The impact of our policies is much wider than the individual securities we buy. It was very important to include Greece during the pandemic, because of the downside risk element of a crisis phase, and the PEPP has been very successful in this regard. And, of course, the PEPP will be reinvested at least until the end of 2023, so there will be a lot of ECB presence in the Greek bond market through the PEPP, regardless of whatever happens to the APP. The issue goes back to, it’s always reasonable to reassess on a regular basis the effectiveness and efficiency of how the APP is implemented.  We’re approaching the second to last TLTRO III tender. Is it time to discuss the future of the TLTRO programme?  It’s too early in the sense in that repayments are still some way off. We do have a window of time to think about whether any new programmes will be needed in the future. There’s no urgency about TLTROs.   "
2021-08-21,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Focus,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Carla Neuhaus on 17 August and published on 20 August 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Focus   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Carla Neuhaus on 17 August and published on 20 August 2021 21 August 2021  Ms Schnabel, do you see the images of the catastrophic floods in Germany or the forest fires in Greece as a sign that the ECB should also do something to counter climate change?   For me, the latest events have confirmed that we are doing the right thing with our new strategy. Only recently we decided to give more consideration to climate protection in our monetary policy. Climate change is the greatest challenge of the 21st century. Unfortunately, we will likely see extreme weather events, such as those we have just experienced, more frequently in future.   But why is that a topic for a central bank?   Climate change has far-reaching effects on economic developments and therefore also on price stability – which is our main task. For example, it exposes the economy to more frequent macroeconomic shocks, which has an impact on growth and inflation.   Critics say that it is up to governments to respond to that, not the ECB…  Of course governments are primarily responsible for taking action. But we as the central bank cannot just stand on the sidelines and do nothing. Our primary objective is to keep prices stable in the euro area. And climate change has large implications for price stability. That is why we are obliged to act in order to fulfil our mandate.   Does climate change push up prices?   That can happen if firms pass on to customers the higher costs they incur by having to become more environmentally friendly or having to adapt their business models. Think of the transition from combustion engines to electromobility or the energy sector’s changeover to renewable energy sources. Added to that is the increasing price of carbon. Food prices may rise, too, if droughts or floods occur more frequently in the future. Nonetheless, it’s not certain that climate change and the transition to a climate-neutral economy lead to higher inflation.   But rather?  Countervailing effects are also conceivable. For example, the prices for sustainable energy sources may decline if more efficient technologies are developed. It may then become cheaper to generate electricity from renewable energy sources. We will therefore have to see which effects ultimately prevail.   What does that mean for the work of the ECB?   We will need to incorporate climate change considerations into all of our future activities. That starts with us having to redesign the models underlying our forecasts and monetary policy. To do so we need new data that we will have to collect. Climate change will in the future play just as much of a role in banking supervision as in our monetary policy measures, such as our asset purchases.   The ECB is still buying particularly high amounts of bonds from firms with high carbon emissions.  That’s true. When purchasing corporate bonds, we have up to now been guided by the bonds available in the market. That automatically results in us holding a relatively large number of bonds issued by firms with high carbon emissions as part of our portfolio, because such firms usually have considerable financing needs and issue large amounts of bonds. We therefore need to reconsider the principle of market neutrality that we have adhered to up to now. However, it would not make sense to completely exclude climate offenders.   Why not?  We have to focus on accelerating the transition to a climate-neutral economy. Excluding certain sectors or firms from our asset purchase programme would be counterproductive. In order to lower emissions, firms with high levels of carbon emissions are extremely important because they offer scope for making the most progress. If these firms want to become climate-neutral, they are dependent on favourable financial conditions.  But how do you intend to ensure that the firms actually put the funds raised by issuing bonds towards revamping their business model?   To that end we need to draw up new criteria for selecting bonds. For example, we could in the future buy more bonds from firms that commit to the goals of the Paris climate agreement and thus show that they are willing to adapt their business model.   So is exclusively purchasing green bonds not an option?   No, a purely green asset purchase programme would not be realistic at present in any case. Even though the market is growing rapidly, there would still be far too few green bonds. And let’s not forget: we are already buying almost a quarter of eligible outstanding green bonds.   As a central banker you also need to keep an eye on financial stability. Could the climate crisis become a financial crisis?   Climate change is also an unprecedented risk for the financial system – and it is not limited to one country but has a global effect. This is what we call a systemic risk.   What does that mean in practice?  Around a third of the loans that euro area banks have granted to firms are – to a significant or increasing degree − exposed to climate risks from extreme weather events. That emerged from our macroeconomic stress test, for which we recently evaluated data from 2,000 banks and four million firms. We took into account the effects of natural catastrophes such as floods, forest fires and droughts, which entail huge losses for firms and thus also for banks and insurance companies. In addition, the climate transition measures pose a threat to many firms’ business models.   What conclusion can be drawn from your results?   Above all, they tell us that the earlier we react, the better. We can then still shape the transition to climate neutrality in a way that allows firms to adapt. The longer we wait, the faster and more radically we will have to respond. If the transition comes too late and too fast, many firms could become insolvent and banks could face high loan defaults.  Are these climate risks factored in at all right now? Do rating agencies take them into account when assessing the creditworthiness of firms, for example?  Currently, climate-related risks are presumably not yet appropriately reflected in prices. However, rating agencies are aware of the problem and are working hard to take better account of climate-related risks when assessing credit quality.  What is the situation like for banks?  The ECB as European banking supervisor has already made it very clear to banks that they need to consider climate-related risks. However, initial analyses show that not a single credit institution is fully compliant with the outlined requirements. The progress made by individual banks varies greatly: while some have made significant headway, others still have a long way to go. That needs to change.  Isn’t it in the banks’ best interest to know their risks?  Indeed it is; that is why banks are keen to tackle this issue. As early as next year there will be a comprehensive supervisory review of how banks account for climate-related risks in their balance sheets.  Will climate considerations play a role in banks’ future lending decisions?  Yes, it is safe to assume so. Climate-related risks will weigh more heavily in future decisions whether, for example, a company will be granted a loan and at what terms. Climate may also play a role in real estate lending: it might become easier to borrow money to build an energy-efficient property. This would set incentives, making energy-efficient buildings more attractive. This is why banks play a key role in the green transformation.  To what extent is inflation affected by climate policy measures, for example the introduction of a new carbon tax in Germany?  At the beginning of the year, prices went up following the introduction of the carbon tax in Germany. For now, these are one-off effects. Nevertheless, a gradual increase in carbon prices may well lead to higher inflation rates in the coming years.  In Germany, the inflation rate is already 3.8%. Are you not worried?  We are faced with a very unusual situation and the current high inflation figures are largely due to transitory effects. At the beginning of the pandemic, inflation decreased significantly starting with the first lockdown. This was mostly due to the fall in energy prices and the policy reactions to the crisis – such as the VAT cut in Germany. Now that we are seeing the economy reopen, these effects are reversing. Energy prices are rising, the VAT rate has gone back to its original level, and all of that automatically pushes inflation much higher. In part, this is simply because the high prices of today are set against the very low prices of last year – the inflation rate always shows the change in consumer prices year-on-year.  So the high inflation rate doesn’t bother you?  No, but I do understand why people might be worried. However, if you compare today’s prices with those before the pandemic, it doesn’t look all that dramatic. While we expect inflation to continue rising until the end of this year, especially in Germany, our estimate is that it will fall significantly as of next year.  Does this mean that you see no reason to change your loose monetary policy any time soon?  That’s right, because monetary policy looks at inflation developments in the medium term. And on that horizon, we expect inflation in the euro area to be below our target of two per cent. As surprising as it may sound to some – we are more worried about the inflation rate being too low in the medium term rather than too high. This may change, of course, for example if trade unions were to negotiate higher wages. But appropriate wage adjustments would also be a good sign from our point of view. Increased demand on the back of higher real wages would bring us closer to our inflation target – which we have been falling short of for years – and help us escape the low interest rate environment.  Why exactly did the ECB change its inflation target? It used to be “below, but close to, two per cent”, now the inflation rate is also allowed to moderately exceed it.  The old wording was less clear and had occasionally been misinterpreted. Some had seen it as a ceiling, assuming that while inflation must not exceed it, undershooting it would not be a problem. That is why we made it clear: the target for us is two per cent. And it is symmetric, meaning that too low inflation is considered equally undesirable as too high inflation.  What’s next for the economy? Are we going to see the strong recovery we’re hoping for?  We continue to expect to see a strong recovery. Given the high level of vaccinations, another hard lockdown is unlikely, despite the current rise in incidence rates. The supply-side bottlenecks in some products, such as microchips, are currently the major constraint. This has hit German manufacturers particularly hard. To solve the problem, it would be important for the international community to support developing countries in boosting their vaccination rates in order to successfully contain the virus.   "
2021-07-29,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Frank Wiebe and Jan Mallien","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Frank Wiebe and Jan Mallien 29 July 2021  Mr De Guindos, the European banks’ stress test results will be announced on Friday evening. What can we expect?   We are not publishing any details until Friday evening, but I can already tell you this much: European banks are robust, they are resilient. The adverse scenario is even more challenging this time than it was in the last test held in 2018 and, on top of that, banks have just come through the difficult year of 2020. Despite this demanding framework, banks have generally performed well in the test.   The average is one thing, the distribution another. Were there significant outliers?   You are right. The range was probably not any wider than last time. But we must of course keep a particularly close eye on banks with clearly below-average results.   Let’s stay on the topic of financial stability. We now have years of lower interest rates and continually rising stock prices behind us. In the United States especially, people are voicing concerns that the system’s debt levels are increasing. How worried are you that maintaining a loose monetary policy will generate bubbles which ultimately imperil stability?  In the euro area we have a lower level of private indebtedness of the economy than in the United States. Some smaller segments of the residential real estate sector may be at risk of overheating, but that was also the case before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. And, importantly: the greatest threat to banks, namely a surge in insolvencies and defaults, has not materialised so far despite the fears we had at the start of the pandemic.  But in general, isn’t there still the danger that a prolonged loose monetary policy will create risks? How can you keep those risks under control?   In formulating our new strategy we decided on a reform, which I don’t think has received enough attention. The previous two pillars of monetary policy, the economic and the monetary analysis, are now being integrated. Monetary policy decisions are built on an assessment of the economic analysis and the monetary and financial analysis, the latter explicitly including financing stability considerations. That is a major step. Moreover, our stimulating monetary policy is necessary now − and for the time being in order to maintain favourable financing conditions.   Does that mean that  financial stability will play a more prominent role in future than it has up to now?   Yes, that’s exactly what it means.  There are fears that the European Central Bank (ECB) will never manage to normalise its monetary policy, because higher interest rates would be too risky, especially for highly indebted countries.   The normalisation of monetary policy, and equally of fiscal policy, follows the normalisation of the economy. If the recovery takes hold, if we go back to pre-pandemic output level, growth is back to potential and inflation reaches our target of 2 per cent, then we should start to normalise our monetary policy. We need to fulfil our price stability mandate, under all circumstances.   But there is still a mountain of sovereign debt.  Yes, that is a legacy from the pandemic. All in all, public indebtedness will be about 20 percentage points higher than before the pandemic. And it’s crystal clear: countries with especially high levels of debt must find a credible path back to sound finances, albeit cautiously and not prematurely. The markets will demand that. But it’s also obvious that the countries had to take action in the crisis in order to contain the economic fallout of the pandemic.   Many economists think that the old rules under the Treaty of Maastricht, of a budget deficit of no more than 3 per cent and government debt capped at 60 per cent, both relative to GDP, have long become outdated because of the current low rates of interest.   Whatever the exact rules are, it’s more important that countries reduce their public debt ratio. But that should only be done when this crisis has faded away.   Do we need a central fiscal authority at European level, also to give the ECB a common counterpart for its monetary policy instead of 19 different governments?  Yes. We need a central fiscal capacity at European level, which would become a key component for the completion of the economic and monetary union. But that would indeed require fiscal and financial convergence among the individual euro area countries.   To that end, would it be helpful if inflation in Germany continued to slightly exceed that in weaker euro area countries?  That is exactly what we have been seeing, for example, in comparison with Spain since 2011. And this has been reflected in the Spanish current account surplus since 2013 until today.   During the pandemic, but also throughout the preceding long phase of low inflation, a certain degree of coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy was important. In this instance, both have been working towards the same goal. But what if differences emerge between the two later, when inflation picks up?  Without this joint effort of monetary and fiscal policy, we would be in a much worse place today in terms of inflation, growth, and employment.  Let’s get down to the details of the monetary policy stance. In its July meeting, the ECB adopted a somewhat complex formula determining when interest rates may increase. Some observers have offered a simple summary, which reads: lower for longer. Is this the correct interpretation?  We agreed, with a large majority, to increase interest rates when we see inflation reaching our 2 per cent target well ahead of the end of our projection horizon and durably at least for the rest of the projection horizon, which presently stretches until 2023. We also need to see a realised progress in underlying inflation. This is not the case right now. While we are currently seeing inflation rates of close to 2 per cent in the euro area, we are expecting them to fall next year and remain in those levels after.   What do you base that assessment on?  We draw on a number of different indicators. But the core components are the official ECB staff projections and, especially, the assessment made by the Governing Council of the ECB.  Short-term interest rates are just as important as the ECB’s asset purchase programmes. The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total volume of €1.85 trillion is due to expire at the end of March 2022 at the earliest. When will we find out whether it will really end then?  We still have time to decide about the future of PEPP. In September we will set the pace of the purchases for the fourth quarter, in December for the first quarter of 2022.  What will the decision depend on?  The PEPP should end when the emergency is over and its dampening effect on inflation disappears.  How do you define the end of the emergency?  It is a medical question first and foremost. It depends on whether the vaccination campaigns are successful in combating the delta variant and whether new, more resistant variants appear.  When will the economy go back to normal? Some define it as being back to pre-pandemic levels. I would argue that back to normal means back to the pre-pandemic growth path.  Could we see the asset purchase programme (APP), currently running at a rate of €20 billion net purchases per month, increase when the PEPP ends post-March?  There are a number of options. In my view, the main priority is to avoid a cliff effect when the PEPP expires. We will need substantial monetary support for the economy for some time to come. Even if recovery is successful, there is still a lot of uncertainty.  The PEPP is more flexible than the APP. The PEPP allows targeted bond purchases from specific countries, regardless of the capital key, which is weighted by economic output and population. Would it make sense to transfer that flexibility to the APP?  We deviated from the capital key somewhat at the beginning of the pandemic, which was certainly helpful. But since then, the bond purchases have broadly been in line with the weights of the capital key.  Do you think there will be more tension within the Governing Council when it meets to discuss these topics in the autumn?  The Governing Council is made up of 25 knowledgeable people and I respect the differences of opinion that may transpire.  Let’s focus on the core of monetary policy – inflation. In the United States in particular a lively debate is under way about whether the current pickup in inflation is temporary or a sign of more lasting price increases. What is your opinion?  Our situation is very different to that in the United States. Over there the inflation rate is well above 5 per cent. For the euro area we are expecting a peak around 3 per cent in November. Next year the pace of inflation will slow down again when a number of one-off effects, such as the temporary VAT cut in Germany in 2020, disappear.  What happens if people get used to higher inflation and react accordingly?  The potential second-round effects such as increased pressure on wage bargaining behaviour or indexation of pensions and the salary of civil servants is something we need to monitor closely. This is because temporary inflation must not be allowed to become structural inflation. So far, however, there have been no indications that this is the case, but we should remain vigilant.  Let’s go back to financial stability. How worried are you about cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin?  First of all, I would call them crypto-assets, not cryptocurrencies. So far, we have not seen evidence that they threaten the stability of the system, but this may of course change in the future. We need to continue reminding people that these are highly speculative investments whose valuations are based on extremely weak fundamentals.  Is bitcoin the motivation behind the creation of a digital euro?  This is a completely different subject – a digital euro will complement banknotes. And we must keep financial stability considerations in mind. A digital euro will complement cash and services offered by banks. People will be given new opportunities to access the digital world.   "
2021-07-29,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Corriere della Sera,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini 29 July 2021  Now that a strong pick-up is under way, is it right for governments to keep running a deficit to provide an expansionary impetus?   The risks of an incomplete recovery are still high, while the risks of the economy overheating and high inflation are still contained. There is still ample slack in the European economy, with people out of work and production plants that have not reopened. We are still not back to the level of GDP that prevailed before the crisis; we’ll only return to that level in the months between the end of this year and the start of the next year. And we are well below the pre-crisis growth path, namely the point we would have reached if the economy had not been hit by the pandemic. We should recover the GDP lost along the way and the productive capacity and jobs destroyed by the crisis as quickly as possible. The United States is about to reach that goal and I don’t see why Europe can’t do the same. To do this, fiscal policy and monetary policy must continue to support the economy.  Is it possible to do this?   Of course. With additional public investment equal to around 1.6% of GDP, the euro area should be able to return to the pre-crisis growth trend in 2022. If the economy doesn’t grow, the poorest citizens will suffer the most. Europe has new common measures, such as NextGenerationEU (NGEU, the EU’s recovery plan), and we can be ambitious. Only a sustained pace of growth will solve the problems of employment and debt.  It all depends on how the Stability and Growth Pact is revised. Does a system like the recovery fund need to be made permanent?   The European Commission has said that the general escape clause, which allows for temporary deviations from fiscal requirements, will remain in effect until the end of 2022.  Should we make the crisis management system launched in 2020 permanent? I think it would be an important step forward, but not everyone agrees and the different points of view are understandable. Future developments and the possibility of making further progress will depend in a decisive way on how we use the NGEU resources. European funds must be used – particularly by countries benefiting most, like Italy and Spain – to modernise the economy and to trigger a growth phase that everyone can take advantage of.  Even the strongest economies?  Underpinning the approval of the NGEU programme is the understanding that in a single currency area with closely integrated economies it is in the interests of all countries – including those with the strongest economies – to benefit from widespread growth. Anyone who thinks they can grow on their own would be behaving like Baron Munchausen, who wanted to lift himself off the ground by pulling himself up by his hair.   But we can sell to foreign markets. Isn’t China a market for German cars?  Europe is one of the world’s largest economies, we cannot rely on foreign demand alone. During the financial crisis we tried through austerity measures to dampen domestic consumption and have foreign demand as our engine of growth. It didn’t work: we ended up with stagnant demand, a sluggish recovery and a long period of dangerously low inflation.  We need to stimulate domestic demand. The NGEU programme can play a key role in this respect, which will be of benefit to everyone. For example, Germany’s GDP will be higher by half a percentage point thanks to the growth that will be generated in other European countries by NGEU.   What is your opinion of Italy’s recovery fund plan?  In the past, structural reforms in Italy were like the Loch Ness monster: much talked about but seldom seen. But now the situation is different. Unlike what happened during the financial crisis, we aren’t planning reforms during a recession or in the midst of political and social tensions caused by austerity. The reallocation of resources between sectors and firms is more agile if the economy is growing. The availability of large amounts of funds to be used for reforms and for stimulating growth provides better starting conditions. Moreover, the basis of the plan presented by Prime Minister Draghi is a very cogent analysis of the problems of the Italian economy: low productivity which translates into low growth, and an unsatisfactory distribution of income and opportunities, including at local level.  Yes, but what about the responses?  Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza – PNRR) has the potential to have a positive influence on the daily lives of households and firms through measures to make the public administration and the judicial system more efficient. Investments are planned in “traditional” sectors (infrastructure, tourism and culture) as well as more innovative areas, such as support to the ecological transition and investment in human capital to overcome the digital divide between Italy and the rest of Europe. With 40% of the funds earmarked for the southern regions, there is an opportunity to address the gap between the south and the central and northern regions – which in my view is one of the main unresolved problems for the Italian economy.  Don’t you think the problem lies in the effectiveness of implementation?  Indeed, maximising the macroeconomic impact will require high quality investments. We are talking about a difference of one point of GDP. The governance of the NGEU programme was designed with this in mind. For example, the gradual disbursement of funds will require the measures to be implemented in line with the provisions of the PNRR.  And I think it goes without saying that Prime Minister Draghi is very well aware of the importance of making the best use of every euro out of the €200 billion that will be made available.   But will the Italian economy grow after the initial rebound?  It is growing and the stimulus from the NGEU is now on the way. The Italian economy will also benefit from the indirect effects of the stimulus that NGEU will provide to the other EU economies.  It is one thing to rebound by 5% after a slump, but quite another to continue at the same pace. Can Italy do it?  If the reforms provided for in the PNRR succeed in modernising the Italian economy, increasing its growth potential, in the coming years a fast pace of growth will be possible. There is the fiscal stimulus making the economy expand and then there is the effect of the structural reforms.  Governments always say that they are combatting tax evasion and carrying out reforms. Then they cut investment.  The funds to carry out investments are now available alongside a coherent plan for reforms. And all this will be set in the context of a growing European economy. Therefore, robust growth rates are not impossible.  The ECB has just approved its monetary policy strategy. Some claim it is more restrictive than that of the Federal Reserve System. Is that true?  We have clarified that we want an inflation rate in the medium term of 2%, not below 2%. A rate of inflation of 1.4% or 1.5% – like we currently have in our projections – is unsatisfactory. We have also clarified that a 2% rate of inflation is not an ultimate limit: if it helps to anchor expectations and makes the 2% target credible, then we can temporarily go slightly above it. Because inflation has been below 2% for so long, we need values of above 2% to pursue our target symmetrically.   These seem like subtleties for insiders…  They aren’t, though. A too-low inflation target can put excessive downward pressure on interest rates and hinder central bank efforts to support the economy. This can be very costly in terms of growth and employment.  The new formulation in the strategy should remove the misconceptions generated by the previous definition of inflation as “below, but close to, 2%”, which led people to believe that the ECB wanted to stay well below 2% and that it was ready to intervene as soon as there was a risk that price dynamics might overshoot that threshold.   What exactly does all of this mean for your monetary policy?  Above all, we will respond forcefully to negative shocks that can push inflation below our target. For cinema-lovers, from now on when inflation falls below 2% our monetary policy should take inspiration from “Pirates of the Caribbean”, even if some would prefer “Sleeping Beauty”.  When price dynamics approach 2% we’ll be patient, however: we will only raise rates when we’re convinced that inflation can be firmly anchored at 2% in the medium term according to a series of parameters which are clearly set out in the new forward guidance, for both expected and actual inflation.  Can you explain why the way in which your stance on inflation is perceived as so important?  The ECB is a very important institution in terms of the economy’s development, and particularly for the path of inflation. If the ECB lets it be known that it is willing to accept very low inflation, then market participants will take this into account. Unions will take it into account during wage bargaining. Firms will take it into account when pricing their products.  The ECB’s inflation target influences inflation expectations and, as a result, actual inflation. Its definition must therefore be clear and credible if our monetary policy is to be effective.   Do the choices made as part of the strategy reflect the fact that the Delta variant is giving cause for concern?  The strategy review established the “ground rules” of monetary policy which will be valid for everyone in the coming years. The forward guidance renders these rules operational and indicates how we will react if the Delta variant delays the return of inflation to 2%. But it’s not a response to the variant.   But could the Delta variant hinder the recovery?  I’m not an epidemiologist and I can’t foresee what will happen with the virus. Some European countries have reintroduced social distancing measures, and we can’t rule out the possibility that this may end up stymying the recovery. The impact will probably be weaker than it was for previous waves. This is partly because many people have been vaccinated, partly because we are learning how to protect ourselves.  Having said that, the still challenging situation in emerging economies also poses risks for us.  Does being prepared to tolerate slightly higher inflation also imply that you would be prepared to accept an overheating economy?  In the past, impatience led the ECB to raise rates prematurely, keeping excessive downward pressure on inflation and stymying growth. So it’s therefore clear to everyone that in order to guarantee price stability, it may be necessary to, as they say, “run the economy hot”, to let it rev up a little.  Isn’t that risky?  On the contrary. It’s a way of making our efforts to bring inflation up to 2% credible. It’s a prerequisite for making full use of the labour resources available and for generating upward pressure on wages that will push inflation up to levels in line with our target.  Is it not the case that after the summer, you will show a more hawkish side by reducing the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the bank’s special asset purchase programme?   The Governing Council has not discussed this issue. It is no secret that there are different opinions on this topic, and when a discussion starts from very different points of view, it’s best to deal with and solve one issue at a time. So the discussion on asset purchase programmes is yet to take place. I can give you my opinion on the matter...  Please do.  At the moment the ECB is using two monetary policy instruments in particular: the recently approved forward guidance on interest rates, and asset purchases. It would not make sense to implement an expansionary monetary policy with one instrument (forward guidance) and a restrictive monetary policy with the other (asset purchases). The main issue for me is how to use asset purchases effectively to consolidate the forward guidance, in particular to ensure an even transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.  What makes you think that the increase in inflation won’t last?  Inflation has risen because oil prices have been rising, but they can’t rise indefinitely. Bottlenecks in production have also pushed the prices of certain goods up for a few months, until the economy returns to normal. There has also been a temporary boost owing to the recent increase in VAT in Germany following last year’s cut. These are all transitory factors that will only have a temporary impact on inflation.  Central banks in the United States and the euro area have been working with governments to support the economy. Some think this could damage the central banks’ independence. Do you agree with this?   Consistency between monetary policy and fiscal policy is crucial at the moment: with negative interest rates, low inflation and weak demand, monetary and fiscal policy both have the objective of getting the economy operating at full capacity again. During the pandemic households and firms were paralysed by lockdowns and uncertainty about the future, and everyone agreed that central banks and governments should push in the same direction. Consistent monetary and fiscal measures are still needed to stabilise inflation at 2%. Our forward guidance shows how financial conditions will develop in the future, allowing governments to take measures without being afraid that the cost of debt will rise prematurely.  There are some who fear that this will result in fiscal dominance – when central banking is subservient to governments’ objectives.  When it’s necessary to take fiscal measures to safeguard price stability, if monetary policy allows fiscal policy to operate this does not result in fiscal dominance. On the contrary, this would be monetary dominance, in that the central bank would actually be using fiscal policy to achieve its inflation target.  How would you explain to a lay person that the digital euro will improve their life?  Today European citizens are making ever more payments using private digital means – think of credit cards – and are buying ever more products online. These trends limit the ability to use banknotes, which offer everyone the option to make risk-free, costless payments. The digital euro will complement cash, offering the option also in the future, in a digital era, to use a universally accepted, risk-free and costless means of payment. No one will be left on the sidelines of payment facilities. Having the digital euro will be like having cash, but in digital form.  Are you taking action because you are afraid that the Chinese digital currency or the Diem – Facebook’s currency – will take over the European market?  That’s not the main reason. If citizens want to make digital payments or make purchases online, the State – more specifically the central bank – must provide the payment instruments to do so. Moreover, the currency is a symbol of the strength, stability and reliability of the State. A State without a currency would be unthinkable, it would only be half a sovereign. For this reason, in a world that is becoming digital, the European Central Bank is assessing the possibility of developing its own digital means of payment alongside cash.  That said, we are not unaware that China and Facebook are working to issue electronic means of payment. A digital euro would protect European monetary sovereignty. But I don’t believe that the euro area is particularly vulnerable to the spread of a Chinese digital currency or the use of a private digital payment instrument. And there is no need for so-called stablecoins, which are instruments that are stable in name only.   Why might they not be stable?  Because they cannot guarantee 100% of the value of the instruments they issue. And we cannot offer citizens a payment instrument that could be worth less at face value tomorrow than it is today. By contrast, the central bank can guarantee 100% of the nominal value of the means of payment that it issues. Commercial banks can do this too thanks to a series of safeguards provided by law: supervision, deposit guarantees and capital requirements.  Proper regulation is required to make stablecoins truly stable. The measures being taken by the European Commission (with the Regulation on markets in crypto-assets) and the Eurosystem (with the launch of the system for supervising electronic means of payment) are going in the right direction and positioning Europe at the cutting edge. But the risks for citizens are still fairly high.  Diem is prepared to let the ECB and the Federal Reserve System distribute their digital currencies via its infrastructure.  This is the opposite of the line from “The Godfather”: it’s an offer that can’t be accepted. It is an ideal offer for Facebook, not for the European economy. We cannot put the entire payment system – which must allow citizens to do their daily shopping, to receive salaries and pensions, and to access their savings – into the hands of a private monopoly. These are tasks and functions that the central bank cannot relinquish. Only the central bank can offer these services with the sole aim of guaranteeing the common good.   "
2021-07-13,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 11 July 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 11 July 2021 13 July 2021  It is only a few days since you announced a new strategy. How will this change the ECB?  I think what has changed is how we define price stability and while in the past, we had this vaguely ambiguous and a little bit complex “below, but close to, two per cent”, we now have what I would call a simple, solid, symmetric two per cent target. So we express very firmly that we are determined to deliver two per cent. I think that is a big change.  Number one, it is simple. So we do away with the perceptions, the ambiguity, the variations between what some see as 1.7, others as 1.95. It's two per cent and it is simple. It is solid because it gives us space to manoeuvre our monetary policy, it is a well-accepted measurement of price stability around the world and it limits the welfare cost of too high inflation.  And maybe the really important third “s” is symmetry, because we affirm very clearly that there may be deviations up or down, either below or above two per cent and we state that we consider both deviations up or down as equally undesirable. At the same time, we know that it's not going to be a straight two per cent linearly forever once we reach the target and we'll recognise that it will oscillate around two per cent.  And finally, we also acknowledge and draw the conclusion from the constraints resulting from the effective lower bound, and we know that as we are close to the effective lower bound, it will require an especially forceful or persistent monetary policy response. So those two qualifiers are very important: an especially forceful reaction or a persistent reaction because we are close to the effective lower bound.  So that's what has changed from a pure monetary policy point of view. I have also some other changes on my mind. And you can obviously understand that having inserted climate change as one of the key components that we take into account going forward is important, is important to us all, because it was unanimously agreed. But it was important to me as one of the goals I had.  It has been an 18-month process and you have done a lot of work and heard from a lot of people. What are the main lessons you've drawn from the strategy review?  There are two lessons that I draw from that process. One is that process matters. And bringing together staff from the entire euro system was important, taking time and making sure that we actually spent a full day, sometimes more, with all Governing Council members able to respond, to react, to internalise, to convince all other members of their views and to arrive at some collective thinking. In my view, this was decisive in making sure that we had turned every stone − as I had committed to at the beginning − and that all voices were heard.  Second, we made a point of listening to the people, which I don't think had ever happened before. So throughout Europe, in 19 countries, and certainly at the ECB, we conducted what we called − copycatting the Fed a little − the ECB Listens. There were multiple events that took place in various countries. I know that, France, for instance, has had 19 different events, not only to listen to what people thought, to hear their concerns, but also to try to explain what monetary policy was doing and what contribution it made to the economy, to investment, to employment with the overarching goal of price stability. So that was a real learning experience for all of us, I think, to understand the Europeans’ concern about monetary policy, what it does, what inflation means to them, what links there are with unemployment, which was a big concern.  What were their biggest concerns?  During the events that I participated in myself, and I heard it from other governors, key concerns revolved around, number one, climate change. Why aren't you doing more about climate change? Why are you financing some segments of the corporate sector that are not respecting the commitments of the Paris accord or that have no concern for the planet? That we heard loud and clear. The second concern that we heard loud and clear as well, was housing costs. Housing costs us a lot, we Europeans, and this was the case in many countries. Why is it not more taken into account in your measurement of inflation? And that led us to do two things. One is to identify a technical and statistical path to better including housing costs in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is not something that we are responsible for, but that we can recommend and encourage, which is what we've done. It would be for Eurostat to hopefully deliver. But second, because we know it's going to take time, we also agreed to take into account alternative measurements, alternative indexes that are not necessarily published in the same rhythm and in the same sequences as HICP, but which will also inform our decision-making process. Those are the two major, strong inputs that we received from the ECB Listens events.   By ditching the inflation target of below two per cent and diluting the importance of its monetary analysis, are you breaking the final links to the old Bundesbank strategy that shaped the creation of the euro?   No, I think what we tried to do with the strategy review was to really adapt the ECB to a world that had changed significantly in the last 20 years. The strategy review was not a random or tantrum decision on my part. It was the acknowledgement that since 2003, the world had changed a lot. You know, the natural interest rate, the equilibrium rate had gone down. A lot of factors were having an impact that probably was not as strong in 2003, let alone in 1999 when the euro was launched. So demographics took not a new turn - because it's a long trend - but certainly became more salient. Productivity was clearly affected as a result of the various crises and the saving trend and behaviour - all that has changed since 2003. And it required that we had a fresh look at the strategy of the central bank to make it fit for purpose for the current circumstances. And I think it's also a recognition that circumstances will continue to change, possibly at an accelerated pace because of the digital revolutions that will be accelerated because of the greening of our economies that need to take place. It's in recognition of that, that we agreed that the strategy would have to be looked at again and reassessed in 2025.  Does the new strategy make the ECB more accommodative than it was previously?   I think the new strategy gives us the ability to be flexible around two per cent, because we recognise that two per cent is not a ceiling and we recognise that there will be oscillation around two per cent. It is more flexible in that we recognise the effect of the effective lower bound and the constraints that it imposes on us. And we define very clearly with the especially forceful or persistent response and the strong response that we are prepared to give. And we also accept that it may imply on a transitory basis, moderate deviations above the target. So in that sense, it is more flexible.  Second, we also recognise the effectiveness of all the tools that we have in the toolbox. And that is not just the first and foremost and traditional tool of the ECB interest rates. But we recognise the effectiveness of those other tools that we had to invent over the course of the last ten years, which are forward guidance, asset purchase programmes, targeted longer-term refinancing operations and negative interest rates. So in that way, I'm not saying that it is more accommodative, but I'm saying that the tools are there and, if they need to be used, we recognise their effectiveness and the fact that some of them, given the effective low bound that we are close to, will have to continue being used.   Do you think the new two per cent target and the acceptance of some overshooting of it in certain circumstances mean that you will be more patient before raising rates in the future, even when you hit your inflation target in the medium term?  I think that what we will have to do now is redefine our forward guidance to align it with the strategy review. When we say that our response has to be especially forceful or persistent, I think persistent is precisely intended to signal that we will not prematurely tighten. But that will have to be a little bit clarified in the forward guidance that we will revise shortly in order to align it with the strategy review. But the use of “persistent” is an indication that there cannot be premature monetary tightening as we have seen it in the past.   That word “persistent” does seem to be key. So do you think it will feature in your forward guidance?  The forward guidance will have to align with the strategy, as we have agreed upon. I'm sure that we will try to shed some light while reserving enough judgement, discretion and capacity to adapt to circumstances. But I don't want to prejudge on that because that's going to be debated around 21 and 22 July.   Critics say that the new strategy has done nothing to convince them you're better equipped to hit your new target more than you have done in the past. Why should they believe you this time?   Three points. One is we will remove any ambiguity. Below, but close to, two per cent is ambiguous. You can sit down on either side of 1.8 or 1.7 or 1.9. And those decimals actually matter. So we remove the ambiguity. It's two per cent full stop. Second, I think our commitment is strongly affirmed. We are committed to delivering on our target, which is two per cent. The strategy, which I regard as a sort of constitutional foundational framework chart for future monetary policy determination, is a strong signal. We are all on the same page. There's a unanimous agreement. There is a total consensus around that foundational document, that constitution of ours. And third, there is also a commitment to better communicate around the strategy review, which I hope we are doing, but also to better communicate on an ongoing basis so that the ambiguity that we have removed from the “below, but close to” does not resurface with ambiguous communication. So I think that, of course, proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but we need to be very clear in our communication of our commitment to deliver our 2 per cent target  The first test will be in changing your forward guidance in just over a week and a half.   It will be tested every six weeks from now on. But I'm not under the illusion that every six weeks we will have unanimous consent and universal acceptance because there will be some variations, some slightly different positioning. And that is fine.   The ECB said in its strategy review that it discussed new instruments. Did you discuss things like buying other types of assets, like equities and bank bonds, or even doing direct distributions of cash like helicopter money?   As I said, we tried to leave no stone unturned, so out of intellectual integrity, we looked at the whole range of anything that you can think of. But that was as part of the intellectual exercise of looking at the whole realm of possibilities. But it didn't go further than that.   Did you reach any conclusions on the possibility of those being in your tool box at a future date?   We certainly concluded that all the unconventional and new instruments were actually part of the toolbox and could be used under the circumstances of the effective lower bound and the need to be persistent in our response.   Did you assess as part of the review whether further loosening of monetary policy is less effective when interest rates are already at or close to their effective lower bound? What was your conclusion?   What we reaffirmed very clearly is the principle of proportionality, of measuring the efficiency, the effectiveness, of calculating the possible side effects and doing what I call a cost-benefit analysis. We are committed to doing it each and every time, as we should. And that was the high-level strategy platform that we agreed on. It's then a monetary policy decision, a mechanism to actually apply that reasoning to each and every tool that we possibly recalibrate one way or the other.   People have said your new strategy doesn’t mention the elephant in the room, which is fiscal policy. Why not come out and say that to hit your inflation target you need more help from fiscal policy, for instance, a permanent borrowing facility at the EU level and more flexible fiscal rules at the EU?   It is actually extensively mentioned, but not in the two-pager. In the 15-page accompanying document, you have quite a bit on fiscal policy and on the close bond between fiscal policy and monetary policy. And, yes, you're completely right that in this environment of low interest rates and when there is the slack that we still have, fiscal policies are very effective and fiscal multipliers are higher and both of them working in tandem is actually much more efficient. So it is not that we were completely oblivious to the fiscal policy impact. Quite the contrary, we did actually have one special seminar on fiscal and monetary policy and there is a lot of hard work that was put into it.   A big worry for some Governing Council members is monetary financing and the idea that you will end up being unable to tighten policy when needed, even under your new strategy, because it would be too painful for the heavily indebted countries of southern Europe in particular. Did you examine this potential problem in the review?   This is a matter that was obviously raised and discussed when we looked at fiscal and monetary policy and how one actually multiplies or leverages the other, and how different it has been this time around from the great financial crisis and the immediate years after that. I think there are sufficient safeguards both on the monetary front and on the fiscal front and obviously, they're going to return and come back into the debate on the fiscal front in particular. But as far as monetary policy is concerned, we have a clear and unambiguous prohibition to do monetary financing. And we have to absolutely respect that, whatever format, whatever clothes it takes. Equally, on the fiscal front, there are many safeguards that have been put in place that have been escaped from over the last couple of years and will continue to be escaped from until the end of 2022, but will come back in some shape or form in order to protect from this monetary financing.   Do you have a view on the shape of the EU fiscal rules when they are reintroduced? This debate has already started in Brussels. Do you want to contribute?   If we are asked for our views, we will certainly communicate them. And I think we have in the past already. But we are certainly keen that whatever is built is simple, easy to measure, countercyclical and comes soon enough so that governments and investors actually know where they stand in terms of the framework within which fiscal policies will be exercised. I think we've also been known to argue that a good euro area budget is certainly a step in the right direction in order to complete the monetary union by giving it a fiscal arm as well. But this is not really a decision that belongs to central banks. It is something that is going to belong to the governments of the 19 Member States.   Your new strategy includes “the recognition that financial stability is a precondition for price stability”. Does that mean that if we have another shock in the future and spreads widened dramatically in government debt markets, we could count on the ECB to do whatever it takes to combat that.   We have demonstrated that in the past, and we certainly fought against the risk of fragmentation simply because we want our monetary policy to be properly transmitted throughout the entire euro area. So if that was to happen again, we would certainly take the measures in order to protect the transmission of our monetary policy and set aside that risk of fragmentation. In the words of one of my predecessors, the euro is irrevocable and monetary policy has to be channelled through all corners of the euro area.  What is the goal of your climate action plan? Is it to guard against the risks of climate change for the ECB's own balance sheet and the wider financial system? Or do you have broader ambitions to act as a catalyst for making Europe a greener place?   Both. It's clear that, from a risk management point of view, we just have to change the way in which we operate by better analysing, better advising and being active in relation to our own portfolio and our own eligibility criteria when it comes to accepting collateral. So it's on all three fronts. The analytical work that we do has to factor in climate change in a much deeper and better way. The advice that we give, in particular through ECB Banking Supervision, has to embed climate change concerns and alert the banks with which we work to the risks that they are facing. And we've very recently done a lot of climate change testing and scenario analysis using the Network for Greening the Financial System scenarios to really understand, and help the banks understand, where there is exposure and how concentrated it is. And we have to act. We started on our non-monetary policy portfolio. We are going to extend that.  We are not going to invent the information and disclosure requirements. We are not going to be able to actually assess the transition plans. And there will be lots of efforts that will be required by the standard setters, by the auditors, by the accounting firms and all the rest of it. But we also have to be, together with these others, at the forefront and not three steps behind. And if we signal that strongly enough, then we certainly operate as a catalyst force. When you set eligibility criteria, it's a bit of a signal.   There are growing tensions in the Governing Council, particularly over the pace of your emergency bond purchases. How long can you preserve this unity that you have managed to construct, not least by sitting down with all your fellow Governing Council members to watch the football and by going on retreats to the Taunus hills?   I neither have the expectation nor the illusion that we will be unanimous on all the decisions that we make. As I said, I regard the strategy review as foundational. The agreed framework within which we are going to weave our policy responses over the course of the next five years, and that's why it mattered so much to me. That's why we went to the Taunus retreat and spent two days hammering out some of those issues and why we watched football together. Yes, that's true. But the weaving of monetary policy within that framework is going to take multiple colours. So unanimous agreement on each and every weaving moment is not a requirement. The more we can agree, the broader the agreement, the better. I think we should really not undermine or underrate those keywords that we have, which is this especially forceful or persistent reaction, the recognition of the constraint, this sort of gravitational force exercised by the effective lower bound that we have to resist, and the transitory period during which we recognise that our policies may imply a moderate deviation above target.   On those keywords, how key is the word “or”? Why not say especially forceful “and” persistent monetary policy action?  I think it's the recognition of the effective lower bound. The “especially forceful” is if the economy is facing an adverse shock. So in the face of the adverse shock, you have this especially forceful reaction because you don't want to be trapped. But recognising that close to the effective lower bound you need to be even longer in the game, that's why you say “persistent”.  Do you think that you are already forceful enough because you're clearly close to the lower bound? Or is it now just a question of being persistent and you’ll get there?  It’s being persistent. It's being very attentive to the next projection and how both headline, core and other indicators of inflation and inflation expectations will be delivering, to see that the persistence we have demonstrated is actually moving the needle.   The new strategy says you will “continue to respond flexibly to new challenges as they arise”. Does this mean that you want to preserve some of the added flexibility of the PEPP, your pandemic emergency purchase programme, after it ends, for instance, on issuer limits and also on buying non-investment grade securities like Greek bonds?   This is not something that we debated as part of the strategy review. We will discuss those matters because they will matter when we get closer to the end of PEPP, but this has not been a strategy review topic.   We've seen record rises in house prices in many European countries and many countries in the world. At what point could the risk of a housing bubble and bubbles in other asset markets lead to changes in monetary policy?   It really depends on what we see. And while there are cities, in particular in some countries where housing prices have gone up significantly and are a concern for people, we don't see it on average across the euro area. We will include housing prices through alternative indexes into our assessment of overall inflation.  The cost of owning a house, not house prices, right?   We will include the consumption part of owning a house. So we will not include the investment part.   There is still much to be decided on how you implement the strategy isn’t there?  Sure, and it will be a constant effort every six weeks. But I tell you, it's been a very interesting process, sometimes laborious, but every bit of it was helpful and conducive to this result.    "
2021-07-10,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Bernau and Dennis Kremer on 8 July and published on 10 July 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Bernau and Dennis Kremer on 8 July and published on 10 July 2021 8 July 2021  Ms Schnabel, the ECB has set itself a new, higher inflation target of two per cent. Do people now have to fear higher inflation?   No, they don’t. For one thing, the increase in the inflation target is minimal. And for another, a target of two per cent has an important function: it creates space so that our monetary policy can have its stabilising effect. In bad times, such as during the pandemic, monetary policy stimulates the economy through low interest rates and so has significant favourable effects on economic growth and employment. However, today’s interest rates are already so low that they cannot be reduced further very much. That is not primarily the ECB’s doing. We have seen a pronounced desire to save, reflecting demographic developments for example, whereas demand for investments has been comparably low. That is why interest rates worldwide have been falling for many years. The new inflation target safeguards our room to manoeuvre and benefits people.   But if inflation rises too high, it’s not good either.   That’s true. The two per cent target also continues to protect people from perceivable losses of purchasing power.   What would you do if inflation overshoots this target?   Our target is symmetric: inflation may sometimes be slightly above it or below. We look through short-term deviations. By contrast, we regard persistent negative and positive deviations as equally undesirable. But when the economy is close to the lower bound, especially forceful or persistent policy measures are required to safeguard price stability. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above the target of two percent. The Governing Council supported this unanimously.   So Deutsche Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann also gave his agreement.   Unanimous means unanimous.  The inflation rate in Germany will shortly reach four per cent. Might it be that the ECB has already lost control of inflation?   No, this development is temporary. Inflation in Germany is now relatively high on account of the pandemic. We will see this as of July – precisely one year after the reduction in value added tax – when prices will be particularly high compared to last year, but only because prices were reduced at that time. The recovery in oil prices has a similar effect. The Deutsche Bundesbank forecasts that inflation will reach just over four per cent in Germany towards the end of this year, but will already fall again significantly next year. Given such short-term fluctuations, the ECB’s monetary policy is oriented towards medium-term price developments – across the entire euro area. Our medium-term inflation projection is subdued: only 1.4 per cent in 2023. Though that is surrounded by uncertainty, I am sure that we will not experience excessively high inflation.   What makes you so sure?   We are currently experiencing an exceptional situation. First the economy was shut down and then it opened up more rapidly than expected. Demand consequently soared, but it has outpaced supply. Think of the problems with the supply chains.   But what if that continues?   We will watch that very closely. Whether inflation rises sustainably ultimately hinges on whether wages also rise and amplify inflation through second-round effects. So far we have seen little evidence of that – also in Germany.  At what rate of inflation will the ECB start to intervene?  In previous years, inflation was too low. The global financial crisis, the sovereign debt crisis, the pandemic: all these crises weakened demand and dampened inflation. That is why it is important to firmly anchor people’s inflation expectations close to our target of two per cent. Moderately higher inflation is a sign of a better economic outlook. We have to support this with our monetary policy for as long as it takes to achieve our medium-term inflation target.  What happens with countries that have high levels of debt, like Italy, if inflation remains high and you raise interest rates? Will it become difficult for them?  Governments will manage this. Many euro area countries reacted to low interest rates by significantly extending the maturities of their sovereign bonds. An interest rate increase has no direct effect on total sovereign debt, but only on the part that has to be refinanced.  So countries don’t have to worry?  Every euro area country has to be aware that interest rates will not always remain low. That means, above all, one thing: countries must use targeted measures to deploy the large amounts of public money that have, for good reasons, been made available during the pandemic, so that they get to a sustainable growth path. That is the best way to deal with pandemic-induced higher government debt.  In the worst case, the ECB would not risk government default.  We are far away from such a situation, thankfully. During the pandemic, the greatest crisis since the Second World War, there was not a single moment when the debt sustainability of a euro area country was seriously called into question.  The higher inflation target gives you leeway to continue purchasing government bonds for longer.  We are yet to decide on the concrete effects that the new strategy will have on our current monetary policy stance. It is clear that we must achieve our medium-term inflation target in a sustainable manner. Bond purchases are part of our standard toolkit.  You are now describing bond purchases as standard? We learnt something different in college.  That is also an outcome of the strategy review. Our primary instrument is the set of ECB policy rates but, when rates approach the lower bound, instruments such as bond purchases are effective and indispensable.  You haven’t placed the resilience of financial markets in the face of crisis at the centre of your new strategy.  Financial stability actually plays a very important role in our new strategy. It comes into play when we assess the costs and benefits of different measures. In addition, we have modified our analytical framework: as before, we have two strands of analysis but they are now more tightly interwoven. The second strand – previously the monetary pillar – has been expanded with financial considerations and now focuses on monetary transmission and financial stability. Few central banks pay such attention to this topic in their monetary policy.  Climate protection also plays an important role in your new strategy. Why is a central bank involving itself in an issue that is not a monetary policy matter?  Climate protection is first and foremost a matter for governments. But climate change is the greatest risk facing economies in the next decades and it has massive effects on price stability and, consequently, on monetary policy. For instance, climate risks in the financial system can compromise the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. This means we have to take it into consideration in the context of our price stability mandate. Until now, our models have not sufficiently taken climate risks into account. This is something that we want and need to change.  Are you also going to be looking at whether companies act in an environmentally friendly way?  It will play a role, both in banking supervision and monetary policy. For example, we are planning to only accept bonds as collateral if the companies that issue them disclose climate-related risks. We also know that private sector bonds bought by the ECB are on average relatively carbon-intensive. This is because we buy bonds according to the volumes that are available on the market, and the market is dominated by carbon-intensive companies. But is the market the right benchmark if it fails to take sufficient account of the climate impact? We will be looking into that very closely.  The devil is in the detail. How much agreement is there on that? We have unanimously agreed on an ambitious action plan. Individual projects will need to be discussed in detail but we all support the overall goal and planned measures.  What if others pipe up now and say: we are also doing great work for society, give us better financing conditions too?  Our overarching goal is price stability. In the case of climate change, the risk of a severe crisis with wide-ranging consequences for price stability is particularly high, and climate change is at least partially irreversible. So it’s problematic for our policy to favour carbon-intensive business activities.  If low-carbon firms were issuing more bonds, you would be buying more of them already.  This is exactly the transition we mean. Once the climate measures fully take effect, market distortions will disappear.  Is it not something that needs to be decided by democratically elected politicians rather than the ECB?  Politicians have already decided just that. But we know that such transition takes time and requires huge private and public investment. The financial market is crucial here. This is where the central bank plays an important catalyst role and can support political efforts.  20 years ago the ECB wouldn’t have discussed such specific issues of economic policy.  Climate change was probably not something that was discussed much even five years ago.  Why has this changed?  A lot has changed in society as a whole. The ECB cannot ignore that. We care about the things that are important to the people – for example house prices, which we will account for better in our inflation measure. We engaged with citizens in our strategy review and we will continue to do so. All of this strengthens people’s trust in their central bank, and trust is valuable in monetary policy.  You want to communicate your monetary policy discussions in “plain language”. Will you manage?  Not everyone will follow our monetary policy statements in great detail. The point is to tailor our communication to different target audiences.  The ECB is getting closer to the public.  That is true, and this could support our price stability objective. While the euro enjoys high approval ratings, trust in the ECB fell somewhat after the financial crisis. It has recovered since but we need to do more. To win their trust, we must ensure our actions are understood by the people.  Is this where Christine Lagarde’s famous charm comes up against the technocratic leviathan that is the central bank?  Christine Lagarde has made a big difference at the ECB. She has put climate change on the agenda. But the ECB is hardly the only central bank that is looking at that topic.  The new strategy was announced sooner than expected – just three short weeks after the Governing Council of the ECB met in the Taunus mountains. Does this suggest that working remotely may not be the answer to everything?  Indeed. Video calls have worked surprisingly well even in serious emergencies. But when trying to reach a consensus, you are much more likely to succeed if you can talk to each other during informal breaks.   "
2021-07-02,Christine Lagarde,Interview with La Provence  ,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie Cécile Berenger","   INTERVIEW  Interview with La Provence    Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie Cécile Berenger 2 July 2021  What was the European Central Bank’s role in the health crisis?   Let’s recall the situation prevailing in early March 2020 when all the political and economic players in the public and private sectors suddenly realised that the health crisis would also have severe economic consequences. The financial markets were then gripped by major uncertainty. Like the other major central banks in the world that I was in contact with at that time, the European Central Bank (ECB) had a dual role. The first role was to stabilise the markets. We launched our pandemic emergency purchase programme, with an envelope which was increased to €1,850 billion over time, to calm the markets and help stabilise prices in line with our primary objective. The second role was to ensure that banks had sufficient funds to finance the economy. At such times there is a risk of credit tightening, of firms no longer having access to liquidity and of economic activity freezing up completely.   Did stabilisation involve purchasing corporate and sovereign debt?   Stabilisation involved purchasing different categories of assets, corporate bonds and public debt (on the secondary market in the latter case, never directly from governments) to provide reassurance and avoid the risk of market fragmentation. Monetary policy should indeed apply across the whole euro area.   Was all of that decided as a matter of urgency? Was there consensus?  No, there was no immediate consensus, but our analyses quickly converged! Given the scale of the risk, we came together in extraordinary circumstances. As it was at the start of the lockdown and the ECB premises were closed, we began to work by videoconference, albeit without the equipment that we now have at our disposal. The emergency purchase programme and the massive funding for firms were decided on during the night of 18 March by all of the governors of the 19 central banks. In my case, I was with some members of my Executive Board around my kitchen table in my apartment in Frankfurt! Our teams had worked flat out for long full days in order to put the finishing touches to these two major programmes. For when the need arises, a central bank is able to respond rapidly and overwhelmingly. Moreover, we tried hard to achieve the broadest possible consensus.   What are the limits to this support to economies by creating money, what is the risk?   The most serious risk would have been to do nothing. The ECB’s primary mandate, laid down by Europe’s founders, is to maintain price stability. For that, the economy needs to be running smoothly, there needs to be investment, growth and job creation. It’s in this context that we offered our support by using the two levers of emergency purchases and exceptional loans at extremely favourable conditions. And we agreed to maintain these measures until at least March 2022, and in any case, until we judge that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. While the recovery is now beginning to get under way, it remains fragile.  What are the limits of these measures?  The ECB’s primary mandate is to maintain price stability. How do you measure this stability? By ensuring that medium-term inflation is below, but close to, 2%. That is our objective, the point we are aiming for. Prices need to increase in a gradual, stable and sustainable manner. For that we need a sustainable economic recovery. But we are not there yet.   Was this reassessment of inflation heralded by the explosion in commodities prices? Is it good news?   The recovery in itself is good news: it started in China, is markedly stronger in the United States but Europe isn’t being outdone. The double monetary lever applied by the ECB and the fiscal policies pursued by the governments and the European Union are fuelling the recovery. We observe a price increase which is notably driven by two base effects. The first relates to petrol prices, which collapsed to less than USD 25 per barrel during the pandemic before climbing back up to around USD 75 per barrel currently. The second base effect concerns Germany, where the rate of VAT, which had been lowered last year to support the recovery, was restored on 1 January 2021. However, these base effects will not last. We will see a return to lower rates of inflation as indicated in our projections.   What are your inflation expectations?  Our inflation projections for this year are around the 2% mark – which is something we haven’t seen in more than eight years. The increase in prices should nevertheless slow to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023. We therefore expect inflation in the medium term to stabilise below our objective  As the ECB’s core task, how does this price monitoring occur?  We measure price increases using several instruments. We take what we refer to, for simplicity’s sake, as a “basket of goods” from which we then strip out food and energy prices. When we look at this more limited basket, we see that prices have increased slightly every quarter over the last nine months. We also closely monitor wage negotiations because a rise in prices leads to higher wage demands, which in turn has a second-round effect: an increase in wages creates additional demand, which puts pressure on prices. We keep a very close eye on all of these factors.  Do you agree with the opinion of some observers that the sovereign debt generated by governments should be cancelled?  No, I don’t. First of all, it runs counter to the legislation and would be an infringement of the treaties. Furthermore, it’s an accounting illusion. Most of the coronavirus-related debt contracted by the French Government and purchased on the secondary market as part of monetary policy is recorded on the Banque de France’s balance sheet. The debt canceled would create a gap in the balance sheet that would have to be filled, either through a contribution from the French Government to the Banque de France, or through a reduction in the revenues transferred by the Banque de France to the French Government. It’s a bit like borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. It makes no economic sense, because interest rates are extremely low at the moment and because if a country were to stop repaying its debts, lenders would be reluctant to fund it. That’s what happened to Venezuela, Argentina and Lebanon.   Should the French people be worried about this debt?  Creating this debt was crucial to avoid an economic disaster. The response of the euro area countries, including France, was necessary. It was fast and complemented by a European effort, the result of which we have just seen – France’s share of the New Generation EU plan, €39.4 billion, has just been announced, 13% of which is scheduled for disbursement in 2021. Immediate measures have been introduced at the national level, such as the partial unemployment schemes, government loan guarantee schemes, etc. At the European level, there must now be a major push to modernise economies. It’s not enough to say “let’s be green, let’s go digital”; we must implement the necessary reforms.  Is helicopter money a solution?   In its purest definition, i.e. in the form of central bank direct handouts to households and firms, it has never been used. That is a matter for the budgetary authorities, not a central bank.  You never miss a visit to the “Rencontres économiques”, do you?  That’s true, I’m more or less a veteran! Except for one time, I think, I’ve attended every year since 2004. It’s an opportunity for sharing ideas, proposals, suggestions and for bringing together the best economists and contributors from a whole range of fields. It’s like one big beautiful melting pot of ideas!  You are also fond of this part of France, aren’t you?  Yes, dating back to my childhood. I lived in Avignon for a few years, where my mother had a home. One of my grandfathers lived in Lourmarin, where he passed away, and I did part of my studies in Aix-en-Provence, so I think I have genuine ties to Provence. My strongest connection to the region is through my husband (editor’s note: Xavier Giocanti). He comes from Marseille stock, which is why I come back to Marseille whenever I can.   Can you tell us about your favourite places?  I especially like Marseille because it’s a port. I spent 17 years of my youth in Le Havre, which is also a port and was a rival to Marseille. The gateway to the sea, the wide horizons and the port activity are enchanting. I like going to the Miramar for bouillabaisse, buying a piece of tuna or anglerfish from my dear friend Christine at the Vieux Port, walking along the Prado beaches when the sea is really agitated, doing some cyclo-cross biking in the Calanques and stopping for a bite to eat in the Baie des Singes. I love Les Goudes! A long time ago, before the Calanques national park was created, I tried to persuade Xavier to buy a little cabin there, but it didn’t work! It’s too late now…  What advantages does our region offer?  There are so many. Against the background of a new Europe and a new growth which is both green and digital, I think Marseille’s positioning is strategic. Apart from being a gateway to the Mediterranean, an area of influences, Marseille is present in key sectors thanks to its university infrastructure and research centres, particularly in the area of healthcare. Marseille offers a mix of geography and climate that can help start-ups get off the ground, particularly in the biotech and digital sectors. You also have the national park, now well-established, which protects the environment, and a whole range of sea-based services for protection purposes. In tomorrow’s economy, this coastline and city boast unique advantages that must be taken advantage of.    "
2021-06-20,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 14 June 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 14 June 2021 20 June 2021  You are getting close now to a decision on whether to pursue further work on the digital euro. You recently completed your public consultation on this, in which the biggest concerns were about privacy. So how do you address people’s concerns about privacy and still do all the necessary checks to make sure that it’s not abused for money laundering, tax evasion, and all of those things?   If the central bank gets involved in digital payments, privacy is going to be better protected. Why? Because we’re not like private companies. We have no commercial interest in storing, managing or monetising the data of users of a digital means of payment. We’re not a profit-maximising institution, we work in the interest of citizens. So we’re a different animal than private service providers. This also emerged from the public consultation. People feel safer if their information is in the hands of the central bank – a public institution – than if it is in the hands of private companies. Second, there are many ways in which we can protect confidential data while allowing the checks foreseen by law to avoid illicit transactions, such as those linked to money laundering, the financing of terrorism or tax evasion.   How would that work?  First of all, we could segregate the data. Suppose that I have to give you money. I’m the payer and you’re the payee. I would go to my bank, which would know that I’m making a payment and would transmit a code to the payment operator. The payment operator would transfer the payment between one code and another code. It would not know the identity of the payer behind the one code and the payee behind the other. So the payment will go through, but nobody in the payment chain would have access to all the information. But this is only one example. We could use cryptographic codes. It could be possible, for example, to make offline payments for small amounts, in which no data are recorded outside the wallets of the payer and payee. One could imagine that for payments of small amounts – €70 or €100 – you could have offline payments without a connection.  But don’t you need to link back to the identity if you’re going to restrict people to a certain amount?   For these amounts, one can also imagine that you don’t do that. Why do we want to have all payments traceable? Because there are issues in terms of money laundering, the financing of terrorism and tax evasion. This risk is much lower for small transactions, as long as they are not used to split a larger payment into many smaller ones. We addressed this in past experimentation by introducing “anonymity vouchers”, making it possible to anonymously transfer a limited amount of digital euro over a defined period of time. So the concept is that controls should be cost-effective. For very small amounts, we could permit truly anonymous payments, but in general, confidentiality and privacy are different from anonymity. Full anonymity must be considered very carefully, because there is a trade-off between guaranteeing full anonymity and guaranteeing compliance with fundamental regulations in areas such as anti-money laundering, combating the financing of terrorism and tax evasion. And let’s not forget that citizens will still be able to use cash, which guarantees anonymity. There are many things we can do, with the help of technology, so people feel safe about how their data are used, and at the same time, so a payment can be reconstructed ex post if the police want to assess whether there’s been any illicit activity, any crime going on. But that would not be in line with the incentives of private intermediaries, which are interested in the commercial value of transaction data. We’ve done some preliminary experimentation on how to safeguard confidentiality with national central banks, which will be published. So we’re discussing possible ways to guarantee privacy. Why are we doing this? For obvious reasons and because the message that emerged from the consultation, as you said before, is very clear. Privacy is a top priority for users.   What about people who say that, while the ECB may not have commercial interests, you are a public sector body? So the idea of the government spying on people by looking at what they’re doing with their money, isn’t that also a concern for people?  I start from the assumption that people should be able to rely on a public institution, and we’ll make sure to set up governance structures to avoid any possible abuse of data. We’ll act within the scope of European legislation, which is the most advanced worldwide in protecting data, with an independent data protection supervisor that we will be interacting with.  Can you tell me a bit more about the experimentation? What does that entail?   The experimentation we’ve done so far is to get a preliminary sense of the pros and cons of different technologies and the limits of, for example, handling payments while safeguarding confidentiality. In this preliminary phase, we’ve organised four work streams in which we’ve tested the possibility of running a digital euro with a centralised system, a decentralised one, a mixture of the two and with offline payments. If the Governing Council gives us the green light in July, we’ll start a formal investigation phase focusing on the design of a digital euro. After two years, we’ll get back to the Governing Council, and in the meantime we’ll interact with other European authorities and institutions – the Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Eurogroup – all those who are involved, because the digital euro will require legislative changes. So at the end of these two years, ideally, we would have more clarity on the steps which would be necessary to issue a digital euro, if the decision were taken to launch it. Then we expect to have, by and large, three years to be able to implement what we have decided on, by working together with the technology providers and banks on the end user features of a digital euro so it could be integrated into the services that they’re already offering to their customers.   Why do you need legislation?  Because, for now, a digital euro is not explicitly foreseen in the European legislation. There are different ways in which you could define the legal basis for a digital euro, depending on its characteristics. Existing legislation may also need to be adjusted to cater for a digital euro. For example, to allow the anti-money laundering authorities to have powers to verify, ex post, not only transactions through bank accounts, but also through the digital euro.   Let’s take a slight step back. There are still some people who are scratching their heads and saying, what is the problem that you’re trying to solve with this project? What is the point of the digital euro?  First of all, for many centuries, from ancient Greece to the Roman Empire and Charlemagne, the sovereign has always offered money to citizens – sovereign money, which is the ultimate reserve of value for citizens. We’re doing the same. We intend to continue to do so. So why do we need a digital euro for this? There are two reasons. First, people are paying more and more digitally, and less and less with our current means of payment – cash. And second, people are buying more and more online, and with e-commerce it is relatively difficult to pay with cash. So people are using the means of payment backed by the central bank less and less. We’re moving into a digital era, so by introducing a digital euro we would be changing how people can access our balance sheet and use our means of payment.  So it is the decline of cash that you are responding to? But you can pay digitally with electronic money, you don’t need a digital euro to do so. I can already buy pretty much anything I like sitting here with my mobile phone.   First of all, there is no digital means of payment that you can use everywhere in the euro area, from Finland to Cyprus.   What about a Visa card?  You can’t use it everywhere. As you know, even here in Frankfurt you can’t use Visa or American Express in every shop. And it can be expensive to use them. Second, I think that this is not just about preserving the role of the instrument of the central bank. There are many other reasons. First, we would offer a means of payment that is risk-free. I think that people do have the right to access the balance sheet of the central bank, which is the only risk-free institution, even less risky than the sovereign. One could imagine that, in most cases, liabilities of commercial banks are pretty similar to the liability of the central bank. But there are situations when differences do matter. You remember in the financial crisis when banks stopped trusting each other. So in that situation, the liability of a commercial bank was not perceived by citizens or by banks themselves as riskless. So you must have a riskless means of payment, a riskless financial instrument in the economy. And this is the liability of the central bank.   Are you also worried about the threat from cryptocurrencies and other central bank currencies?   This is not why we started this analysis and will possibly start a project, but of course there is the potential threat that could come from others issuing a digital means of payment. This could be a so-called global stablecoin or another sovereign providing a digital means of payment. And if people do want to pay digitally and we don’t offer them a digital means of payment, somebody else would do that. So I can give you many, many reasons. And by the way, it’s not just about payments. This, I think, is a historical change that will not only change the way the financial system works. This will change the attitude of citizens towards digital instruments. I think this is a fundamental change to how payments will function in the future, both for the financial system and for society at large. And it is generating huge interest.  Do you think the end consumer is going to notice a big difference? Because legally they will have a claim directly on the central bank. But for all intents and purposes, it’s just going to be numbers on a screen, the same way that their digital deposits are shown on a banking app.   Most of the time I would agree with you, but not always. The great financial crisis was a very big wakeup call. It’s not true that people don’t differentiate. Most of the time, they don’t need to differentiate between different means of payment, among liabilities of different issuers of different means of payment. But there are situations in which people do understand very well. They optimise. They don’t care about whether they have bank deposits or cash, unless the bank deposit becomes risky. In that case, they seem to understand the difference very well and they seem to differentiate very carefully.   Some people imagine that the central bank is going to be operating these digital euro accounts directly. But is that really how it’s going to work? You’re more likely to outsource the management and the operation of this to the commercial banks and some fintechs, right?  It’s theoretically possible that the central bank would handle the accounts of individual citizens. But it’s extremely unlikely that this would be the choice we would make. Why? First of all, there are currently, I believe, around two million or more bank employees in Europe, dealing with 400 million customers. There’s no way that the limited number of employees at the central bank could do this. So even if we were crazy enough to embark on such a project, we could not do it. We’re very productive, but not that presumptuous. Second, we don’t want to use the digital euro to change the structure of the financial system or to destabilise the functioning of the financial sector. Banks already provide citizens with a large number of services, and in the future they would add access to the digital euro as one additional service to build a business model with the “digital euro inside”. Banks are also much better than central banks at onboarding, and at know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks. We could not do it. So even if it is theoretically possible, it’s very unlikely. What we want is for the digital euro to be a sort of raw material that we would hand over to banks to provide the services they are providing now, plus access to the digital euro, in the same way they’re already providing access to cash.   Only banks?  Well it would be intermediaries that are involved in the provision of payment services. They would need to be regulated and supervised intermediaries. So not only banks.   Is there a danger of crowding out innovation by the private sector?   We’re a very peculiar supplier of services, because in general, private service providers want to take market share from competitors. We’re not that type of provider. What we want to do is negate the risk that the digital euro would crowd out banks and innovation in payments. So we’ll take care of that. I think the digital euro would be a source of innovation, not the opposite. And we’ll not crowd out banks, because this will be a public good provided by the central bank to foster innovation, progress and efficiency in the financial system.   That must be one of your primary concerns: to avoid destabilising the banking system in any way or facilitating runs on banks in crisis times?   Absolutely. We’re reflecting on how to avoid that. What we want to offer is a means of payment, not a form of investment. To avoid crowding out banks, we are discussing possible alternatives. One possibility is to put a cap on the amount of digital euro that individual users could hold. So you can hold a maximum of, say, €3,000, but not more. Any money in excess of that would have to be transferred into a bank account. Another possibility is that you can hold as much as you want, but beyond a certain threshold, you would face a financial disincentive. Up to €3,000 euro, amounts held in digital euro would never be treated less favourably than cash, they would never be remunerated at interest rates below zero. But if for some reason you wanted to hold more than that, then you would face a financial disincentive that would discourage you from doing so. Why would we do that? Because if people could hold an unlimited amount of digital euro, they could shift all their deposits from bank accounts into digital euro, especially in the run-up to a crisis, potentially precipitating a banking crisis. Which would destabilise the financial system. By the way, these proposals which originate from the ECB are now being discussed quite widely around the globe.   Are you leaning towards one or the other of those?  No, we will take that decision after consulting with stakeholders, citizens, merchants and banks, and there are implications and pros and cons in either method. For example, the cap may be more powerful. You cannot hold more than €3,000 full stop. Right. But then we would have to deal with a number of complications. Suppose that you have €2,800 in your digital euro account and I owe you €500. If I make a payment to you, what happens to the €300 that exceeds the threshold, the cap of €3,000? Either the payment cannot go through, which would be disastrous as it would create uncertainty about the completion of a payment, or a waterfall mechanism would have to be set up to transfer the rest to a bank account. But that would mean obliging you to have a bank account, which is at odds with the concept of financial inclusion, which is one of our objectives. Access would need to be provided to basic bank accounts that are free of charge. Tiered remuneration is of course more market friendly. But is it powerful enough? In a crisis, it could be very difficult to have a financial disincentive that is large enough to cause you not to seek security if you fear that your bank could go under and that you could be bailed in. So you would need to bring down the remuneration of digital euro in excess of a threshold when there are concerns about a financial crisis. But then that would be a signal that would need to be managed. So, you see that there are solutions, but each of them – cap or tiered remuneration – has advantages and disadvantages.   Is a digital euro going to use blockchain, or distributed ledger technology?  In our tests, we have experimented with two systems. One is a centralised system known as TIPS. We have used this to analyse the functioning of a theoretical digital euro. How many transactions can be done per second using that infrastructure? And how much time does it take to complete each transaction? We had excellent results with TIPS, suggesting we could handle hundreds of millions of transactions per day, and the completion time for payments was negligible. Then we have also looked at distributed ledger technology (DLT). While there are types of DLT which are used by commercial banks for financial transactions, there’s no experience of DLT that could serve the needs of 400 million customers. And we’ve also experimented with a combination of the two, because there’s no reason why one should exclude the other. We could have a centralised system with different nodes, and then these different nodes would interact with the centralised base enabling you to multiply the power of the system. But this is a question for the IT experts.   Regulation of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, how do you see that? Do you think that stablecoins need to be more tightly regulated?   We still have unstable coins. To become stablecoins, a necessary although not sufficient condition is that they need to be regulated and supervised. And obviously, the coins have a number of risks for individual consumers and for the financial system at large. So what is the mechanism behind the so-called stable or unstable coins? The stablecoin issuer sells the coin to you, then uses the proceeds from the sale to invest in reserve assets. But those reserve assets do not have the certainty or stability of their value. They may be low-risk assets, but they are not risk-free assets. It is also uncertain whether the issuer holds an adequate amount of such assets to back the value of coins in circulation. Then there is the possibility of the value of the asset changing and the value of the coin changing. In periods of financial tension, there could be an expectation that the value of the coin would change significantly because of the value of the asset, and then there could be a risk of people going to the issuer and withdrawing their money. That is the mechanism that leads to a run. But unlike in the case of banks, there is currently no supervision. There is no deposit guarantee scheme and there is no emergency liquidity provision by the central bank, because the central bank cannot commit public money to save entities that are not subject to adequate prudential requirements, meaning that there is an inherent instability in the function of these coins – and for this reason they are still unstable coins. Once we have regulation and oversight, it is possible they might become more deserving of the name “stablecoins”. But only the money issued by the central bank is truly stable. Europe is at the forefront of regulation in this field. The European Commission’s legislative proposal for a regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) sets out a number of mechanisms to reduce the risks to consumers and to financial stability. And the message sent is that until the regulation is in place, the presumption would be that no stablecoin should start operating in the euro area. At the same time, we are looking to adopt our oversight framework. We are currently discussing our new Eurosystem oversight framework for payment instruments – the PISA framework – and it will be adopted to include oversight of stablecoins. Once this is done, then we will discuss the possible introduction of such coins.   What about cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and the like? How are you managing them at the moment? Because the regulation framework isn’t in place yet.   There is no formal mechanism that we can use to prevent any investor in the euro area from buying crypto-assets. They are not currencies; they are not money. The risks they bear are very high. I think there should be careful regulation. MiCA introduces regulation for crypto-assets. Our PISA framework will also give us the possibility to conduct oversight of crypto-assets.   What does this mean, oversight of crypto-assets?   It’s very difficult to regulate them, to oversee them, because there is no responsible legal entity. They are decentralised. They could be in China. They could be in Switzerland or in South America. They could be anywhere. But to the extent that intermediaries are involved in the supply of those crypto-assets, then we would have regulation and oversight in place.  In my view, crypto-assets are very dangerous animals. They are not money, they are contracts that are perfectly fine for gamblers. We should try to protect consumers as much as possible. And we know from recent experience that those crypto-assets are largely used for criminal activities. We also have the issue of energy consumption. Bitcoin mining, for example, uses a huge amount of energy. This is not sustainable.   When will this supervision start? When is PISA coming into force?  By the end of this year, I hope. But we also need the MiCA regulation, because it is complementary to our PISA framework.   Let’s talk about monetary policy and the implications for that. You talked about imposing negative interest rates on digital euro to disincentivise people from holding too much of it. Could it be a way to make interest rates even more negative?  No, because first of all, we’re not planning to withdraw cash. The reason why there is an effective lower bound for monetary policy is that if you bring interest rates too low, people would turn to cash, as the cost of storing cash would become lower than the cost of holding a non-cash instrument.  We’re not introducing the digital euro because we want to change the way we implement monetary policy in any way. We’re not planning to withdraw cash. So we would never use the digital euro for monetary policy, and we would never use it to impose deeply negative interest rates by design, because we’ll continue to supply cash.   Have you got any idea of the cost of launching the digital euro project?   Currently we pay for the costs of producing banknotes and end users are not charged, but we are not losing money. Quite the contrary, because we earn seigniorage – which results from the difference between the face value of money and the cost of issuing it. Likewise, with the digital euro we won’t charge end users and we will incur some costs, but we won’t lose money. Seigniorage means we’ll have more liabilities and more assets, and we’ll make money out of that investment under normal market conditions. As part of the investigation phase, we’ll discuss the overall architecture and how the various stakeholders involved in the transactions charge each other, but citizens paying with digital euro won’t be charged. And I don’t think that the cost of issuing a digital euro will be large. We already have experience with wholesale and retail payments. Suppose that we use TIPS – the technology is already in place. And national central banks already use DLT. So I don’t expect the cost to be prohibitive. And the proceeds would be very large, because that’s a way of maintaining the size of the balance sheet, which means that you have more liabilities and more assets. This means that you’ll earn more seigniorage.   Will intermediaries make money on it?  The ECB as the issuer will not charge users. Intermediaries will offer services with digital euro inside to cover their costs. This is a complicated issue that will have to be addressed: the interaction between banks, intermediaries and customers. And competition has to be ensured to limit the fees and charges for customers.  How will this change the world of finance, the world of money for the consumer out there?   This would be a very powerful push for digitalisation. It would allow everybody to have access to a safe, risk-free, cost-free means of payment in the digital era. We’re currently still in a period of transition, but 20 years from now, everybody will be using digital instruments. The digital euro and cash could co-exist, but I’m sure that everybody would be using digital means of payment. You can build programmable products at lower cost. For instance, users could decide to allow automatic payments for routine transactions, such as paying bills, using a toll road, going to the cinema or parking.   So is this just for the eurozone or will it be available to people outside the eurozone? And if so, is there a danger you erode the monetary sovereignty of smaller countries?   There is indeed such a danger, and that is why we’re considering which potential users should have access to digital euro. Within the euro area, €3,000 would already be above the cash requirements of most people today. But in some countries, including some not far from us, with lower GDP per capita, €3,000 in digital euro form could be too large an amount, as it could trigger financial instability by depleting bank deposits. We’ll have to reflect very carefully on access and limits for foreign users. Of course, foreigners that come to the euro area as tourists should have access to digital euro. But here too, we would use limits. Then there is another and more positive international dimension: the possibility of doing cross-border payments. We’re already cooperating at the international level. The advantages of introducing central bank digital currencies would be maximised if we made them interoperable, as they could make cross-border payments more efficient and much cheaper.    "
2021-06-17,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Bloomberg TV,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon on 17 June 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg TV   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon on 17 June 2021 17 June 2021  I am here with ECB Executive Board member and chief economist, Philip Lane. The ECB has, of course, only recently, last week, pledged to maintain an elevated base of bond-buying through the next quarter. So it's not ready to go anywhere near tapering or anything like that at the moment, but let's have a chat with Philip and find out what the next steps might be. A very good day to you. The Fed yesterday, brought a little bit of a surprise. Certainly, it's taken a step towards tapering, a baby step. Does that influence how fast the ECB might move in that direction?  I think it's very important to recall that, of course, the pandemic is global, but in the end, where the United States is today and where the euro area is are so different, both in terms of the stage in the pandemic recovery, in terms of the reopening of the economy, but also in terms of the wider inflation dynamic, and fundamentally – there's a few days' difference in these meetings. Last week we had an assessment where inflation, even if it's a little bit high right now, is going to converge back to 1.4 per cent in 2023. So a low inflation medium-term pressure. The Fed has a very different medium-term outlook, and that difference really just means we can't spend too much time trying to compare central bank priorities on both sides of the Atlantic. We are just in a very different phase to the Fed.  The Fed noted that inflation has been stronger than expected. The readings in the eurozone have also been stronger than expected. I'm aware your forecasts don't see it as holding above target, but there was always the risk that there are surprises that start to seep into expectations. Your colleague Robert Holzmann, the Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, said at 3 per cent inflation the ECB would have to react, although he didn't say how and what that reaction would be. Would you agree with that kind of a threshold?  What's been interesting is that everyone is thinking more generally about inflation these days, but when you start to analyse it, the conditions under which those famous second-round effects might actually take hold, when we may actually see them in the data, are really most likely with a very strong labour market. Going back to that basic point, the basic difference between the European debate and the US debate is that we have a general measure of unemployment which is around 15 per cent. It's very difficult, when you have unemployment so high, to see very strong wage pressure. The wage negotiations we do see are coming in low, which is not surprising given the slack in the labour market. So the narrative of this second-round dynamic, of course we look at it, we monitor it, but you actually have to see it converted into wage decisions and pricing decisions, and we don't see it so far. The economics of it is that we know it's going to take a long time for the labour market to fully recover, and without that full recovery, the bargaining strength to compensate for rising prices, without that dynamic it's very hard to sustain that narrative.   So say you did get 3 per cent, or 5 per cent as in the United States, for one month, you would be happy to look through that?  At the ECB, like at all central banks, we know we have to have a medium-term orientation, for two reasons. One is that monetary policy doesn't work on a dime. We have no way to influence the inflation rate in the next month, two months, three months, even longer. The focus has to be on the medium term. When we know that the dominant sources of high-inflation readings are transitory factors, base effects, spikes which are going to reverse, we maintain our focus on the medium term.   So for the next quarter you're going to be maintaining favourable financial conditions and an elevated pace of bond purchases. Given that the market will be thinner – it's always thinner in the summer, the ECB has always slow-purchased in the summer – would you expect your pace of bond buying in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter because you can have a bigger impact?  So I think it's very important to appreciate the philosophy of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). Last week we had our meeting and we decided to maintain the same stance, and that the conditions where the economy is improving but there remains upper pressure on nominal yields are conditions where, essentially, we think the decision we made in March to step up remains a good decision, remains the best guidance. But with PEPP, we also have a very strong philosophical design, which is that we're not mechanical, in the sense of saying: “We will do X amount and no more and no less.”. (The alternative way of doing quantitative easing is to say: “We're going to buy X billion.”) And then the seasonality factor is easy, because you just rearrange. You know August is coming – August comes every year, it's not a surprise – and you rearrange your fixed schedule: more in other months, less in August. We don't have a fixed volume approach to PEPP.  This is why, the issue about the summer liquidity is secondary, because we want to observe, and we have the day-by-day flexibility. There could be investor shocks over the summer, in either direction, positive or negative, and so we very philosophically are determined not to express monetary policy as an exact ex ante volume, but to say: “We will purchase in response to market conditions.” So this is why it's kind of a subtle argument. Please remember seasonality is usually just a mechanical adjustment, which is, basically, unmet over the course of a period and adds up to zero – it's a rearrangement. But with PEPP, because we're buying flexibly in reaction to market conditions, we want to be sure that we look at everything on a frequent basis, and seasonality is just one factor.   So you've got a meeting coming in July, but one assumes that that's stocktaking. September is more likely to be the big one where you've got a new round of forecasts, your Strategic Review will be close to finished or maybe finished. Then you're six months before the scheduled end date of PEPP. At that point do you think you have to talk within the Governing Council on tapering?  We have tried to explain so much about PEPP. We've said from the word go that net purchases will remain so long as the pandemic crisis phase is with us. We said: ”How do we conduct net purchases?”. It's in order to offset the negative pandemic shocks to inflation, and in terms of implementation we're going to buy flexibly to preserve favourable financing conditions. All of those remain, and given that flexible philosophy, given the importance of thinking about the inflation outlook, given the unpredictability of the pandemic, I fully agree with President Lagarde that it's unnecessary and premature to talk about these issues. When we get towards a time – and let me focus maybe by saying that that time is state-contingent. It's state-contingent on what we are learning about the pandemic, first and foremost. So trying to box that into a particular calendar I don't think is very productive, while also agreeing with you, of course, as time moves on, as we get more good news about vaccinations, about dropping case rates, there will be a time when it's no longer premature and unnecessary to talk about it. But right now, the focus for me is, we're going into a very interesting summer, and the challenge of preserving favourable financing conditions, we have to keep our eye on that.  Going back to September, we will have new forecasts, but remember, we have a very strong forecast for quarter three, but quarter three is not over until the end of September. We're not necessarily going to have every piece of hard data you want to have going into the September meeting. If you recall, last year our beliefs about quarter three were quite different in September to the outcome. So September is, of course, going to be an important meeting, but there's going to be a lot of data coming in throughout the autumn, and I think it's a mistake – because we know from September onwards there's a lot that could be happening. It's not some kind of “turn-on-a-dime” situation where we're going to know everything at a point in time, but of course, we'll know a lot more over the summer.   It sounds like, though, potentially, September is also premature, given that it's still summer. It's not winter. We don't know what's going to happen to the virus during the winter. We don't know what waves we're going to get. So could we get an elevated pace of bond-buying right through to the end of the year, and December's the big meeting?  Again, I'm going to repeat, this all depends on what's happening to the pandemic itself, where the data come in, because, of course, I've mentioned to you that not all the hard data will come in, but there's so many forward-looking indicators. But I would say that, regardless of how the September meeting goes, there's going to be a lot of work to do between September, December, into next spring. And given the fact that the inflation outlook remains quite subdued, of course, it's a multi-year challenge for us. Having the accommodative monetary policy to bring inflation up towards where we want it to be, it's not a situation which is going to end very quickly. So we do have a sustained campaign ahead of us.  Just quickly, I mentioned the Strategic Review. You've got a weekend retreat coming up somewhere outside Frankfurt. The two big issues there, for most people, are the inflation goal and climate change. Are you nearly resolved? Are all the sticking points sorted on those?  What we've had over the last year, year-and-a-half, is a lot of analysis. Let me praise the work of the Eurosystem staff at the national central banks and the ECB. We've had amazing inputs into our discussions. We've had many discussions on individual topics, but it is fair to say at this point in time, over the summer, we do have to move from analysing and discussing to kind of forming our collective view about where we want the strategy to be. My own assessment is we've made a lot of progress. I think it's actually been a very interesting intellectual journey, but the whole point of a retreat such as this weekend is not to put ourselves under pressure. It's not a decision-making meeting; it's just a meeting in the spirit of every organisation who has a retreat, to be a little bit open-ended, relaxed and have a good conversation.  Most people would expect the inflation goal of below but close to 2 per cent, which Lagarde said can be confusing in her last press conference, to be dead. That's gone. There is going to be a hard 2 per cent. There's a lot of debate about how flexible you can be around that, but would they be wrong to jump to that conclusion?  Again, I think I'll be correct about procedure here, in that, as in many situations, nothing is decided until everything is decided. I think you've heard from many of my colleagues – I'm sure I've said myself – that, essentially, there is a downside to the current formulation, for the reasons you give. That one of the overriding philosophies of central banks these days is to try and be clear in our communication. Not always possible, but where we can, we've been clear in our communication, and I think everyone recognises the case for having a clearer expression of our inflation aim.   Climate change, that's been a thorny subject sometimes.   Here I think there's a lot of global convergence. Let me emphasise, of course, there are interesting and vital discussions about some operational issues, such as corporate sector purchase programmes. That's a global conversation, but the bigger issue for me as the chief economist is how climate change is affecting economic dynamics, and how the necessary carbon transition is going to be a very large structural change for the euro area economy, for the global economy in the coming years. It already is. We see it meeting-by-meeting. So the fact that you have to, as a central bank, consciously make the effort to make sure you're investing, to make sure you've got the framework, to make sure you're fully responding to the challenges of climate change, I think that's just necessary, and it's so important that we do it. At that level it's not controversial. You've seen it around the world. Look at the expansion of the Network for Greening the Financial System, look at the global movement, look at all the announcements from many central banks.  So I would say, of course, the ECB is very committed. I think we've been a prime leader in this. But what we have now is, essentially, a global movement where maybe some details will differ, but by and large everyone's moving in the same direction. It's not the fact that central banks have some special role here; it's the fact that the world's policymakers, in line with the Paris Accord, there's a huge job of work to do, and central banks need to play their part. A lot of this, of course, is just implementing what other policymakers are leading on in terms of disclosures, transition plans, carbon regulation, carbon pricing. All of these policy changes by others have a counterpart in how central banks need to behave.   "
2021-06-14,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Politico EU,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck and Florian Eder on 11 June 2021 in Frankfurt","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Politico EU   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Johanna Treeck and Florian Eder on 11 June 2021 in Frankfurt 14 June 2021  The eurozone still needs fiscal and monetary support. That is why we would very much love to know for how long you expect the region to still need the proverbial crutches that you cited?   In terms of real gross domestic product (GDP) we are likely to be back to the pre-COVID-19 level that we had in December 2019 – if the Delta variant doesn’t ruin our plans – in the first quarter of 2022. That is one quarter earlier than we had expected in our projections in March. We have to take the economy through the pandemic and into a recovery phase, which has now started. We need to really anchor the recovery. We always talk about inflation anchoring and we are not oblivious to that. But the recovery needs to be firm, solid and sustainable.  You don’t remove the crutches from a patient unless and until the muscles have started rebuilding sufficiently so that the patient can walk on his or her own two legs. The same applies to the economy. We are at a turning point where, bearing in mind alternative variants, we are on that recovery path, heading firmly towards a return to the pre-COVID-19 level. According to our latest projections, we see the euro area economy being back to the pre-COVID-19 level during the first quarter of 2022. That said, I am not suggesting that the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) is going to stop on 31 March. We have plenty of flexibility, but in terms of economic outlook we are heading in the right direction.  So there are indications that, as originally foreseen, you should be able to end the PEPP at that time?  I wouldn’t say it that way, because the wording in the introductory statement, including yesterday’s, is very specific and says until at least March 2022 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the pandemic crisis phase is over. But our projection, and the design of the PEPP as we have it, seems to be heading in the right direction. But as stated previously, it is far too early to debate these issues.  As you are assessing the outlook, do you have an eye on the developments in the United States, for example, and in other economic areas?  Yes, I think it’s very healthy to have a panoramic view and to look at the global economy because the global economy, whether it’s advanced or emerging market economies, has an impact on any domestic situation.   G7 leaders are at this very moment meeting in Cornwall. Should there be more of a coordinated response among the West?  The answer is a strong yes. You know I’ve attended G20 meetings for 15 years. It’s a relief to see this impetus, momentum, determination to go together and come together and have some steps along the way, as we have seen in the last six months, since US President Joe Biden was elected. Before there were a few years of difficult multilateralism, particularly in the last four years. In 2008, during the global financial crisis, there was also a determination to come together; Gordon Brown was UK Prime Minister and in the leadership of the G20 at the time. President Barack Obama was interested in multilateralism, but he was already not as interested in Europe as he was in Asia and his famous pivot towards Asia. Multilateralism, as we had known it before, was changing. But now it’s clearly back. And even the announcement of half a billion shots of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for poorer countries that was made yesterday is quite spectacular on the part of the United States.    Can we talk about the strategy review? Some of your colleagues have suggested that you might follow the example of the Federal Reserve and move towards average inflation targeting. What do you see would be the merits of that approach?  I’ll tell you how we are conducting the strategy review because I think the process matters. There had been no strategy review since 2003 and I thought it was overdue.  When we started this strategy review I said we would leave no stone unturned. We’ve had more than a dozen seminars on each and every aspect that you can imagine. From the definition of price stability to the measurement of inflation, to the definition of medium term, to the relationship between monetary and fiscal policies, to climate change impact, to communication. We looked at every possible issue. In so doing we also looked at what everybody else was doing because we learn from either the past or from the neighbours. So of course we looked at what the Federal Reserve had come out with – its average inflation targeting with asymmetric symmetry and focus on employment. This is what they do, this is what worked for their strategy review. It does not prejudge what will work for us, and our work has not yet been finalised. One thing I can tell you is that we will stay within the boundaries of the EU Treaty. The commitment I had made was to leave no stone unturned, but equally to get something that is going to work. What would have been unreasonable would have been to go through that process and declare that we needed a Treaty change. So we are working within the parameters and the boundaries of the Treaty. That’s very clear.    You promised results of the strategy in the second half of the year, which starts soon. Our understanding is that you have progressed very far, so might you present results towards the end of the summer already?  I would hope so. But whether it is at the end of the summer or in autumn is less important than the quality of the review and the solid consensus.  Would you support a more regular strategy review exercise? A five-year cycle has been floated.  I’m not sure it has to be every five years, honestly, we haven’t settled on that one. My personal view is that if you do this every five years, there comes a time when a new president comes in and he or she is almost stuck for the first five years of his or her term. Instead it could be aligned with the presidency. That way, the first year every presidency will continue with the previous strategy implementation while getting a new review under way.  It’s somewhat of a constitutional moment, when you think about the route, the anchor, the instruments, the relationship of monetary policy with fiscal, with financial stability, for example. It’s really foundational in a way. Therefore, you shouldn’t have to do that on a too-frequent basis.   You say that the Treaties are the boundaries. To what extent is the German constitution or the German Constitutional Court in your mind when you think about these things. Is that much of a concern?  It’s one of the other things that I had to deal with in my first year as ECB President. It is this judgement by the Karlsruhe court and the determination of what the relationship is between the European legal order and the national legal orders. Obviously, the European Union has to pay attention not just to the German Constitutional Court, but to all the Supreme Court equivalents or highest court in the countries. But as far as we are concerned, we are governed by European law and we fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  What is fascinating about the ECB is that it is riveted on one objective and that is price stability, price stability, price stability. I must have heard it 1,000 times in my first couple of months. So you are riveted to that. But at the same time, the world changes around you, and not just the world in your vicinity, but in the 19 Member States that you serve. And you have to constantly be attentive to the interactions and the changes that are occurring.  I hope that when we complete the strategy review, climate change will have a space. It will be an indication of the fact that the ECB is attentive and capable of adjusting and adapting. Climate change is an example, the digital euro is another one. We are riveted to our price stability objective, and we are the custodian of the euro, but we have to be attentive to the big developments around us as well.   So would you say that, following the strategy review, the ECB is giving more room to its secondary mandates.  No, not at all. I’m telling everyone interested in those distinctions, particularly those who say the primary objective matters most: price stability is a very focused as well as a broad mandate. For instance, if you don’t pay attention to climate change, how can you assume that you have price stability, and that your new definition of inflation is correct? How can you assume to have price stability if you don’t change your models not only to take into account what happened in the last 30 years but also what’s likely to happen in the next 30 years and will affect asset values today?   Do you think it is easier for you, because you did not spend a career in central banking, to look a bit more to the left or to the right than a classic central banker would, as you just described?  I like to think so but maybe others don’t. If I didn’t think so I would be very unhappy every morning when I wake up and I come here. Diversity helps.   On the strategy review, the general expectation is that at the very least you will move towards a more symmetric target of price stability at 2%, which would imply a slight change of your goalposts. Would that then warrant a policy reaction to bring policy in line with the target?  If we were to go in that direction, that would be a clarification of the symmetry that has already been affirmed since July 2019, but which is, which probably has been, confusing for observers and for markets as well.  Is there one particular lesson that you have learned from listening to people? I was wondering what people have on their minds when they are asked about monetary policy.  The outreach exercise that I think you’re referring to was opened up to anyone and everyone who wanted to participate. I would put the respondents into categories. We had our usual interlocutors: members of NGOs, trade unions and other interest groups. And they asked the expected questions. But what I found most interesting were the people who participated and did not belong to any particular group. They raised questions like: “Why don’t you take climate change into account?” and “Why aren’t housing prices better incorporated into the measurement of the price pressure that we are under?” And we had some vivid examples of people saying “Okay, five years ago I was paying so much. There’s not been any improvements to my apartment and I’m paying so much more now. And yet you’re telling me that inflation is only that. Explain to me why that is.”   Is that a pan-European topic actually?  It is. The 19 national central banks had their own outreach events. And housing was a key point. People were also interested in what the ECB can do to help with unemployment, and what we can do with wages. So, this is not the primary objective but with the medium-term aspect, climate change, housing costs, employment and wages can be captured as well. We had very good questions, such as “Why do you want to pursue this 2% inflation goal – I’m happy with a zero increase in prices?” So, it certainly told us that we have to better communicate why we need some inflation and that we have to be more explicit and use less jargon than we did – and still do actually – in our various communication channels.  Did you make progress on figuring out how you might incorporate housing prices? It’s been an issue that’s been around much longer – I think under your predecessor Jean-Claude Trichet, even back then it was debated. So do you think that you’ve made progress?   I hope so.   Speaking of people’s opinions, the latest Eurobarometer survey showed 80% of respondents support the euro but only 46% trust the European Central Bank. What are you doing wrong?  First of all, 80% is a phenomenal number. It has improved over time and has fared well during the crisis. So, the euro, of which the ECB is the custodian, is popular. It is regarded as a link – or the cement – between the 19 euro area countries and the populations of these 19 EU Member States. That is phenomenal. I still remember the front pages of various newspapers 20 years ago, not necessarily on the Continent, predicting that the euro was doomed to fail and that it would be a disaster. So that is a superb result. The 46% that you mentioned – that is an improvement on where we were a few years ago. Our image might have to do with the role that the ECB had to play during the euro area crisis. Because the ECB was associated with the Troika, and the Troika was itself associated with austerity, harsh measures, and decisions coming from the outside. There was this sentiment of abandoned sovereignty – people feeling that they were no longer in control of their destiny, that the “men in grey suits” were coming to dictate the rules, which is a caricature of what was hoped for and expected. That may have caused some of this discrepancy between the trust in the euro and trust in the ECB.  But for the first time since then, we have more people who trust the ECB than don’t. But we need to work on that further. We need to explain what we do and how we do it. As custodian of the euro we fight for the citizens, but explaining that price stability is a fight for them, that’s sometimes difficult.   Everybody knows that one famous sentence of your predecessor. Can you define the “whatever it takes” for your term, for the post-pandemic era?   Our commitment to the euro has no limit. That’s what I said. And that’s what I tweeted on the night of 18 March 2020, when the Governing Council decided the PEPP. I think it was explicit and those in the know understood the message very well.  Support has no limit meant exceptional circumstances require an exceptional emergency purchase programme. If you pack all that together, it’s heavy. And I think we delivered. Not to brag about it, but we sure delivered.   What’s your take on the EU recovery fund, Next Generation EU? Is it courageous enough, is it big enough, will it help?  When I look back, it’s amazing the change that occurred, first in May, then in July last year. In May, it’s an indication that when the Franco-German tandem works, it makes a huge difference. It’s not enough, but it’s a strong impetus, and messages were well understood. Then came July, again a strong signal of unity of purpose and joint action. Now it has been ratified and the process was completed one month ahead of schedule. The Commission will be active on the markets next week, and it will be able to deliver 13% of the funds before the end of the year as advanced payment. I think that’s a very, very strong change and it’s a structural response to the very severe shock that was inflicted on all of us.  Now the next question is whether this is enough. Well, let’s first make sure that it’s issued, it’s distributed and, more importantly, it goes towards projects that enhance growth, structural reforms and towards the changes that are contemplated. If countries can demonstrate that not only do they ratify, not only do they submit the plan, not only do they collect the money but that they also actually deliver right to the last inning – meaning that, on the ground, it’s actually done – that is a very strong statement.   It’s a big challenge and one that can really transform the future of Europe. I think all governments know that. President Draghi, where he is now, recently acknowledged that challenge.   So you are very confident that this time it will work, and that reforms are going to happen. Do you think this is built into this process and into the new rules, or is it rather because people are aware of what’s at stake?   It’s both, I hope. When a country says that it’s going to restructure its justice system, which has been untouched for decades, it’s hard work. As Wolfgang Schäuble would say, it requires “implementation, implementation, implementation”, and attention to detail, because the moment you want to change, you come up against so many barriers.   How do you see Europe after Angela Merkel’s retirement?  Europe will be different because Angela Merkel has been a defining leader for a long time. I am not taking any views with regard to who will be the next chancellor. But I am confident that he or she will lead a pro-European government and that will be good for Europe.   "
2021-05-28,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi, Frank Siebelt and Francesco Canepa ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi, Frank Siebelt and Francesco Canepa  28 May 2021  What is your assessment of the economic outlook, particularly in comparison to your last projection made in March?   We have reasonable confidence that we have reached a turning point. The pace of vaccinations has accelerated, infections are going down and containment measures are gradually being lifted. Sentiment indicators have come in quite strong recently, not only in manufacturing, but also in services. So, we are seeing a surge in demand, which sets the stage for a firm recovery. Consumer confidence is also picking up quite sharply. At the same time, fiscal and monetary policy remain very supportive. The short-term outlook has brightened.   Are we still in an emergency? What are the criteria to declare the end of the emergency?  We are still in the middle of the pandemic. It is far from over, neither from a health nor from an economic perspective. But we are seeing substantial progress, helped by the extensive policy support. We can be confident that a large share of the population will be vaccinated by the end of the summer, which makes new containment measures less likely. But a relatively large part of the economy remains in a state of emergency. Activity and employment are still below pre-crisis levels and the recovery remains uneven.  From a monetary policy perspective, the main thing to look at is the inflation projection. This is the ultimate yardstick against which we measure whether the emergency is over, since we said that our tools are meant to offset the negative effect of the pandemic on the inflation outlook. The recovery still depends on continued policy support. A premature withdrawal of either fiscal or monetary support would be a great mistake.  In December 2020 we made clear that our support would be there until the end of the pandemic period. It will be there at least until March 2022 or until the Governing Council judges that the pandemic crisis phase is over. Our intention was to remove uncertainty about a premature withdrawal of support.   Should we expect an increase in your growth projections?  It’s too early to tell, we will have to wait for the numbers. But in any case, projections in these times are surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty because we are in a crisis that lacks a precedent in the recent past.   Given that nominal yields have risen but real yields have not, are we still enjoying favourable financing conditions?   Some of the increases in nominal yields have reversed lately and the President’s communication of last week was important in clarifying certain aspects of our policy.  I’ve always stressed that when it comes to favourable financing conditions, it’s insufficient to just look at the numbers. We have to understand the drivers behind the movements. It’s instructive to compare what happened recently to what happened at the beginning of the year. There are notable differences. Most importantly, recent yield developments were more clearly related to an improvement in the euro area’s growth outlook rather than to foreign spillovers. Rising yields are a natural development at a turning point in the recovery: investors become more optimistic, inflation expectations rise and, as a result, nominal yields go up. This is precisely what we would expect and what we want to see. It’s therefore important to also look at real rates and, as you say, real rates have been broadly stable. So, from this perspective, I would certainly say that financing conditions remain favourable.  At the same time, government bond yields have recently been rising more quickly than risk-free rates, even for the safest bonds, such as German Bunds. We are attentive to such developments because they may point to changes in the expected amount of duration supply, and this could be related to expected changes in our asset purchases. This would be a source of concern.  Is it time to reduce the pace of PEPP purchases to levels before the March increase?  There is one fundamental misunderstanding about PEPP and it’s related to the current public discussion about tapering. In December we committed to preserving favourable financing conditions until the Governing Council judges that the pandemic crisis phase is over, but at least until March 2022. This implied two things: first, the PEPP is linked to the pandemic and, second, the volume of our purchases is data-driven. In June we’re going to look at the drivers of financing conditions, we are going to consider additional aspects such as seasonality, and we’ll analyse the inflation outlook. This joint assessment will then determine what is going to happen with our asset purchases.  The whole concept underlying the PEPP is inconsistent with the idea that there will be a mechanical tapering of asset purchases. We always have to be willing to reduce or increase asset purchases in line with our promise to keep euro area financing conditions favourable and to offset the impact of the pandemic on the inflation outlook.  Some of your colleagues have explicitly come out in favour of keeping the pace of PEPP purchases stable at the June meeting. Do you also have such an explicit view?  One cannot give a firm answer at this point without having seen the data. This is an essential element of the PEPP: we don’t announce in advance a specific volume of purchases that we are going to have every single month; rather, we assess financing conditions jointly with the inflation outlook and then take a decision based on these data. That is very important to me.   You also have a quantitative target, which is the size of the envelope. That is why some people say you either taper or increase the envelope. Is it time to discuss increasing the envelope?   The remaining envelope is quite large. For now, it doesn’t impose any restrictions on our decisions. It is therefore premature to talk about things that will become relevant only well into the future. It will all depend on two things: on how financing conditions evolve and on when the pandemic crisis phase is over.   PEPP was launched as an emergency tool to deal with the effects of the pandemic. Could it end up staying until inflation converges to the ECB’s target?  It is not the objective of the PEPP to bring inflation fully back to 2%. PEPP is designed to counter the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. We have other tools to bring inflation back to our aim. We should not forget that we continue purchasing €20 billion every month under the APP.   At what point is the steepening of the yield curve damaging and inconsistent with favourable financing conditions?   It all depends on the underlying drivers. If the economy improves, yields, nominal and real, will go up at some point. Yield increases will only be harmful if they are not accompanied by an improvement in the outlook, or if they are disorderly. It depends on this distinction, whether a yield curve steepening is considered benign or not.   Some of your colleagues say the ECB will need to rotate at some point from PEPP to APP. When should this rotation start and what conditions are required?  I wouldn’t use the term rotation here. PEPP and APP are separate programmes and serve different purposes. PEPP aims to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on the inflation outlook. The PEPP will end when this has been achieved. We are not seeing this yet.  But, ultimately, getting back to the pre-crisis inflation path is not enough. As things stand today, it’s likely that when the PEPP ends, we will not have reached our medium-term inflation aim of below, but close to, 2 per cent. In that case, we will continue to run a highly accommodative monetary policy also after the PEPP. This not only includes APP, but our other monetary policy tools such as the TLTROs, negative interest rates and forward guidance.   Do you think it would make sense right now to consider a rate cut to stem the appreciation of the euro exchange rate?   It makes a big difference whether the euro appreciates in the context of an improved economic growth outlook or because of expected changes in our monetary policy. These drivers directly determine how the exchange rate is affecting medium-term inflation dynamics, and this is what ultimately matters. This type of analysis is important to see if our monetary policy is calibrated appropriately. At the current time I don’t see the need to adjust the deposit facility rate. However, we always stress that this is one of the instruments that we have in our toolkit and that we could use if needed.  How will the recent commodity price rises impact the medium-term inflation outlook?  In our baseline, we assume that the factors we are seeing today are transitory. But we cannot be sure.  To see this, it is useful to distinguish two types of factors. On the one hand, there are technical factors, like base effects. These we understand well. A large part of the volatility of inflation this year will be driven by these factors. It’s perfectly clear that we have to look through these temporary effects, and this has to be explained to the public.  The other factor relates to how supply and demand are going to interact when the economy reopens. It is much harder to assess how persistent these effects will be.  At the moment, demand is surging while supply is plagued by bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions. This has implications. We see that delivery times have gone up quite substantially, the ratio of orders over inventories has gone up and producer price inflation has accelerated. The question for us is how this will translate into consumer prices. Before the pandemic, cost-push factors were often absorbed by profit margins. Now, we have to see whether it stays like that in a situation where firms are suffering because of weaker balance sheets and where there is a lot of pent-up demand. And should the pass-through be higher than in the past, it could also be the case that there are second-round effects with increases in wages. But all this is highly uncertain and we cannot at this point in time be sure of what is going to happen. Our baseline is that it is likely that most effects are going to be transitory and that at some point the bottlenecks will disappear. But there is also a risk that it’s going to be different, so these are developments that we should watch very carefully.  The governor of the Banque de France made the case the flexibility built into PEPP to be carried over to APP and he mentioned flexibility in the pace and jurisdiction of purchases. Is that something that you would support?  This is something that would have to be assessed very carefully, so it’s too early for me to make any statements on this. We’re soon going to come out with a new monetary policy strategy. As part of this review, we will reconsider all of our instruments and ask ourselves how to best move forward under our new strategy. That is the moment to discuss adjustments to our tools.  Would it make any sense to remove the reference to a “significantly higher pace” of PEPP, which is quantitative rather than qualitative in nature, from the policy statement to make it clear that purchases depend on financing conditions and not on a pre-determined volume target?  Significantly higher is not a quantitative statement, it just indicates a direction in the volume of purchases that was taken in response to developments in the markets that we considered premature at the time. I don’t think this stands in contrast to the idea that we don’t want to make quantitative announcements.  Would you be in favour of just saying something like “the pace of the PEPP will be adjusted based on financing conditions”?  I guess markets will be interested in knowing the direction of adjustment. I don’t see anything that speaks against including an indication of that in the policy statement.  Now to the review that you’ve just brought up. Would you support taking a leaf out of the Fed’s book and having an average inflation target, albeit with a lot flexibility around it?  We should reconfirm our commitment to symmetry with respect to the definition of our price stability objective. It should leave no doubt that we take risks of too low inflation just as seriously as risks of too high inflation. There are also very good reasons to stick to the medium-term formulation. It gives us flexibility, for example to deal with supply-side shocks. It also clarifies that we cannot fine-tune the inflation process to the first decimal place.  An open question is whether we should tolerate higher inflation temporarily when we are in a situation in which inflation has been too low for too long, as is the case today. This is something that needs to be discussed in our strategy review. I would say that our current forward guidance already signals our willingness to do so to a certain degree because we say that we will not raise our policy rates until we see that the robust convergence to our inflation aim has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. There are certainly ways to make this commitment clearer. When it comes to going a step further towards average inflation targeting, I’m quite sceptical. Theoretically this is appealing, but the implementation faces substantial difficulties. It may heal one asymmetry, caused by the zero lower-bound, only to create another one. While it may be credible to keep inflation higher for a while when there has been an undershooting, the opposite is not so clear, because the associated economic cost would be substantial. The implementation and communication of average inflation targeting are also quite tricky. How long should the period be over which the average is calculated? How much of that should be communicated? How would we deal with supply-side shocks that central banks typically look through? All this may create additional uncertainty. And while this type of strategy appears attractive when inflation has been too low for an extended period of time, it may not fare equally well when the environment changes. I personally don’t think we should follow such a strategy.  Is it time to start discussing an extension of the current TLTRO operation? Is it becoming semi-permanent?  The TLTROs have been, besides asset purchases, our main instrument to deal with the pandemic and have ensured that the bank lending channel has remained fully operational. We still have three operations left until the end of the year, which implies there is still quite a bit of stimulus in the pipeline. Now is not the time to discuss further operations, but if we see that there is a need to do more we can do more.   Given the surge in excess liquidity, when are you planning to revisit the tiering multiplier?  Since the start of the pandemic, owing to the asset purchases and the additional TLTRO operations, excess liquidity has continued to increase. But the net costs to the banking sector are, in the aggregate, much smaller due to very generous conditions on our TLTROs. All this has to be considered together and, if we do that, we don’t see any particular risks to the bank-based transmission of our monetary policy. Therefore, there is currently no need to discuss adjustments to the tiering multiplier. But, of course, it is an instrument we can use if needed. The remuneration on the exempt reserves could also be adjusted, but at this point in time I don’t see any need for that either.   "
2021-05-26,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Nikkei ,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jun Ishikawa ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Nikkei    Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jun Ishikawa  26 May 2021  What’s your assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area? Philip Lane said that we are now at an inflection point…  The lesson from last year is that we should be careful about declaring victory too soon. We received positive data over the summer, everybody was celebrating the end of the pandemic, and we know how that turned out: the economy went into a double-dip recession. The outlook is now improving. We expect a rebound in the second half of the year, supported by the acceleration in vaccinations, the firming of global demand and, domestically, by the deployment of Next Generation EU funds. The recovery in tourism flows, which hopefully will last more than a couple of months like last year, will be emblematic of a gradual normalisation. But there are two points to keep in mind. First, the recovery is incomplete: euro area GDP is still 5.5% below its pre-pandemic level and even further beneath its pre-crisis growth trend. This means that millions of jobs lost during the pandemic have not been recovered. Second, the economy still relies on the oxygen provided by both monetary and fiscal policy: we are far from the point where we can see self-sustained growth. For example, job retention schemes continue to play a major role: in the euro area, the share of workers who are unemployed, discouraged or enrolled in such schemes is around 17%, double the headline unemployment rate. It will take time to see how the economy will exit this terrible period and the real damage it has left behind. There's also still a lot of uncertainty, as you can see from consumers’ prudent spending behaviour and high precautionary savings. If you have a job supported by your government, you can make a living today, but you would naturally be worried about your job in the future. In such an environment, a premature withdrawal of policy support would risk suffocating the recovery before it becomes self-sustained. And it would exacerbate uncertainty, further weighing on demand. So we must continue to closely monitor the incoming data and ensure that the exit from the crisis is supported by a robust and lasting recovery. The output gap, the employment gap and the inflation gap are the key variables to determine when we have truly gone beyond the pandemic phase. They are expected to gradually narrow, but they are still far from satisfactory.  We are not out of the woods yet …  No, absolutely not.  What is your inflation outlook? Euro area annual inflation increased to 1.6% in April. It looks like inflation is coming back, doesn’t it?   We are currently seeing a transitory increase in inflation driven by rising commodity prices at the global level, statistical base effects and the reversal of the German VAT cut. But this will be a temporary hump: it is not expected to last beyond this year, as it’s not self-sustained and it’s not domestically driven. In any case, underlying inflation, which is mainly driven by domestic services, remains very low, at 0.7% in April. Looking further ahead, our March projections foresaw that medium-term inflation would remain subdued: only 1.2% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023. We should not extrapolate from what is happening in the United States. We don’t expect the same kind of surging demand and tight labour markets that would generate stronger lasting price pressures. Recent inflation surveys are in line with this picture. I am concerned by the fact that, over our policy horizon, inflation is going to remain well below our objective of 2%. This may affect our credibility after so many years of inflation “misses”. Moreover, too-low inflation aggravates the real cost of debt at a time when private and public debt ratios are rising in order to offset the collapse in income caused by the pandemic.  Why does it take such a long time to return to 2%? Can we call it Japanification?  Japanification is the wrong expression in my view. It describes a situation where inflation expectations re-anchor at very low levels and become hard to dislodge. That’s not what we see in Europe. Long-term market-based inflation expectations are still around 1.6%, which is not optimal but a sign that the situation is very different from Japan. What we’ve had is a sequence of huge shocks. First, the great financial crisis. Then the euro crisis. And now the pandemic. But the European Central Bank (ECB) can bring inflation back to its objective. We have the tools to push inflation close to 2%. And there is general agreement in the Governing Council that the current levels of projected inflation are unsatisfactory. It is clear to me that the level of inflation in the medium term is still decided by the central bank. And we need to preserve our credibility, continuing to act forcefully until we reach our objective.  I would like to move on to monetary policy. Should the ECB continue after June to purchase bonds under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at the same pace as it does now?   The objective of the PEPP is to maintain favourable financing conditions, which are crucial to supporting spending by both the public and private sectors. With demand still weak and underlying inflation at very low levels, policy support remains essential and a premature tightening in financing conditions must be avoided. The risk of providing too little policy stimulus is still high. In my view, only a sustained increase in inflationary pressures, reflected in an upward trend in underlying inflation and bringing inflation and inflation expectations in line with our aim, could justify a reduction in our purchases. But this is not what we projected in March. And, since then, I have not seen changes in financing conditions or the economic outlook that would shift the inflation path upwards. In fact, we are now seeing a further undesirable increase in yields after the rise we observed earlier in the year. Financing conditions are tightening. In this environment, it is not surprising that we have also seen a persistent, non-negligible appreciation of the exchange rate, which – if sustained – would weaken inflationary pressures. We will discuss the implications of these trends in our June meeting, especially in the light of the new projections for medium-term inflation.  Would it be very difficult to end the PEPP by the end of March 2022 as scheduled?  I can’t currently speculate on what we will do in March 2022. That is almost a year from now, and a year is like a century today, given the high degree of uncertainty. And let's not forget that we did not say that we would end purchases in March unconditionally. The Governing Council decided that we would continue to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Our objective is to stimulate the economy enough to end the coronavirus phase. So let's see what the recovery will look like six or nine months from now, and what happens to inflation and inflation expectations. And let’s remember that, even when the coronavirus phase is over, inflation will still be far from our aim and we will need to use our tools to get back to our 2% goal. In this respect, we have formulated clear forward guidance on how we will use interest rates and asset purchases during and beyond the pandemic period.  Klaas Knot suggested shifting from emergency support to more conventional forms of support. What do you think about this idea?  The decisions to increase or decrease the pace of purchases, and to prolong or end the PEPP, are collegial decisions that depend on the state of the economy. They are conditional on seeing evidence of a robust recovery and sustained inflationary pressures, reflected in an upward trend in underlying inflation, that bring inflation and inflation expectations in line with our aim. From my viewpoint, the conditions that we see today do not justify reducing the pace of purchases, and a discussion about phasing out the PEPP is still clearly premature. Our decisions should not be swayed by narratives from abroad. Instead, they should be guided by compelling data about the euro area.  Should we wait until September or October?  We should wait until we have more clarity on economic and inflationary developments, and until we can be confident that they will enable us to deliver on our mandate. This implies, first, that we neutralise the effects of the pandemic on inflation, and second, that we continue our policy action until we see inflation sustainably reaching levels in line with our aim in the not-too-distant future. In my view, it is reasonable to look at a horizon of around two years for inflation to converge towards our aim.  You will decide in the next few months whether to launch a formal project to assess the possible introduction of a digital euro. But why do you need a digital euro? We already have many tools, such as Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, Google Pay…  For two main reasons: we see that people are buying more and more online and that they are using digital payment methods with growing frequency. If these two trends continue, the role of cash as a means of payment may decline significantly. But cash is the payment instrument issued by the central bank, its tangible link to citizens. Providing safe, sovereign money as a public good has been a core mission of central banks for centuries. I think we should continue to fulfil this core mission. Second, we need to prevent the European retail payments market from being dominated by a handful of non-European players who could be relatively immune from the regulatory scrutiny and oversight of European authorities. This could result in insufficient competition and data protection. And in the absence of a European digital payments solution, our monetary and financial sovereignty would ultimately be at stake. A digital euro would protect privacy, increase consumer choice, reduce transaction costs and support the digitalisation of the economy while making sure that sovereign money remains at the core of the financial system. And it would level the playing field by allowing all market participants to build on the digital euro to offer additional services.  So do you see the big tech companies from the United States as a threat to Europe?  A small number of non-European companies already dominate some parts of the market for retail payments, such as credit cards and online payments. In the future, the role of the big tech companies could become very significant in financial services, posing risks to privacy, competition and technological autonomy, as we have seen in other markets. The introduction of a digital euro would help to keep competition open and stimulate innovation while strengthening Europe’s autonomy and financial resilience.  You said that a digital euro would be safe and riskless. But it could also be troublesome. What do you think about the impact on the existing banking system?  The digital euro would offer consumers a safe, riskless, totally liquid means of payment. In the absence of any limits or constraints to its use as an instrument to store wealth, it could attract huge investments, including large transfers of retail deposits from banks to the digital euro. This could increase the risks to financial stability, especially in a crisis. But we would avoid those risks. There are two possible ways to address them. One is to restrict the holdings of digital euros by individual users, for example to no more than €3,000. This would limit the outflow of deposits from banks to the digital euro. The second possibility is to discourage large holdings of the digital euro by imposing a penalising remuneration on amounts held above a certain threshold. The digital euro would therefore provide an efficient way to pay digitally in sovereign money rather than act as a form of investment. This would avoid instability in the financial sector and preserve financial intermediation.  Will you restrict using or holding a digital euro outside the euro area?  A digital euro accessible to non-euro area residents would offer a safe means of payment for retail transactions across borders. But in vulnerable emerging market economies, a digital euro could also be a very attractive form of investment. If not properly designed, it could facilitate capital outflows or even currency substitution, which could trigger financial instability. Conditions for access and use by non-euro area residents could therefore be designed to prevent excessively volatile capital flows or exchange rate fluctuations. Limiting or disincentivising excessive digital euro holdings by non-euro area residents are examples of how this could be done. In any event, international cooperation on design, cross-border use and interoperability would be key to reap the potential benefits of central bank digital currencies for cross-border payments while addressing risks to the international financial system.  China will issue a central bank digital currency by 2022. Would it be a threat to you?  The Chinese authorities have announced that the digital renminbi will be designed for domestic use and for retail transactions. They want to preserve the role of sovereign money in the digital era and they are reacting to the expansion of Chinese big techs. In the longer term, building interoperability between central bank digital currencies could reinforce their domestic benefits. This would make cross-border payments easier, cheaper and more efficient.   So China is not a competitor, but a partner for you?  Central banks are already cooperating, both bilaterally and in international fora. We are in contact with central banks in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland and also China. We can learn from each other and improve our understanding of the challenges that are associated with the possible introduction of a digital currency.  When will you start issuing a digital euro?  We started our discussion with the horizon of five years in mind. Five years is likely to be the minimum time necessary for the introduction of a digital euro. The Chinese started working on their digital currency eight years ago, in 2013. The Swedes started to work on the e-krona in 2017, and they have said they might be able to introduce it in 2026. So experience shows that the introduction of a digital currency requires time.  Does that mean we could have a digital euro in 2026?  That would be the earliest date. We should not rush to finish first. This is not a race. We cannot take the risk of introducing a digital currency that will not work well for users, or that would generate instability, domestically or abroad. It is such an important change. If we decide to issue a digital euro, we want to be sure we get it right.   "
2021-05-10,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Le Monde,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert and Marie Charrel","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Monde   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert and Marie Charrel 10 May 2021  The eurozone has gone through a double-dip recession. After the huge recession of the first half of 2020, GDP fell again in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. What is the state of the eurozone economy?  Rather than looking at this quarter by quarter, we should look at how far the economy is below its 2019 level. Right now, we're probably four or five per cent below that. This is a huge downturn. In comparison, in a normal recession, it is maybe one or two per cent. I think we are now, in May and June, at an inflection point. From now on, the economy will be growing quickly, but from a subdued level. So even with pretty rapid growth for the rest of this year, the euro area would only get back to its 2019 GDP level around this time next year. For the labour market, we think unemployment will only fall back to its 2019 levels in 2023. It is a long journey, which requires a sustained effort by fiscal and monetary policymakers to support the recovery.   How much scarring do you fear the economy will have?  There are reasons to be optimistic. Compared to the decade following the 2008 financial crisis, the pandemic will only be a two or three-year event. So scarring can be limited because the recession will be shorter. At the same time, there are sources of concern, because there was not just the shutdown of the economy. Education and healthcare have been disrupted, which will have a lingering effect. The effects of the pandemic have also been very concentrated in some sectors: hospitality and travel, for example, will be very disrupted for a long time. The world will not be the same after the pandemic. There will be structural changes and some losers and winners. For example, if you were in a city centre location providing services for offices, or in the travel industry, you face long-term challenges. On the other hand, there'll be those who gain from supplying services for working from home, like IT for example.  You said that a lot of fiscal support is necessary. There is a €750 billion package from the European Union, Next Generation EU (NextGen). The problem is that it was agreed in principle in July and is still only being ratified. Is the EU doing too little, too late?   When you look at the European fiscal response, you have to look at the national responses and this extra layer at the EU level together. While we wait for NextGen to be implemented, national fiscal policies can act in the meantime, providing disaster relief and general macroeconomic support. It was always clear that NextGen had a medium-term orientation. It is essentially a five-year project, focused on investments, to make sure that we have a sustained recovery over five years.   But when we compare it with the Biden plan (USD 1.9 trillion) and the stimulus packages launched by the former US president, doesn’t the EU plan seem very small and less ambitious?   I take a different view. Economic performance is not a race, a stronger US recovery is good news for Europe. At another level, for Europe, it also illustrates the potential of having a common fiscal framework and deeper fiscal integration. NextGen is a step forward in fiscal union, but in a limited way. It shows the potential that could be unlocked if we had a more common approach to fiscal policy.  In the United States, the ability of the government to finance any scale of deficits is not questioned. If we did have more of a fiscal union in Europe, the ability of European governments not to worry about how to finance deficits would be a lot stronger. But the EU has already played a positive role. What would Europe have looked like during the pandemic without the European institutions and the ECB? What we were able to do last year would not have been possible if we had 19 national currencies in Europe. It shows the value of having a single central bank. Similarly, without the euro, many small European countries would have had to borrow in foreign currencies, which is more restricted in terms of scale. The common currency has increased the fiscal capacity of all euro area countries.  On top of that, Europe has demonstrated it is willing to have a degree of joint financing like NextGen. It should not just be seen as €750 billion. The world's investors have understood that Europe will stand together. The signal NextGen has sent had an immediate effect of lowering risk premia across Europe. The value of that is many times the value of the fund itself.  However, isn't there a danger that, after the pandemic, European Union countries withdraw their stimulus too early and make the same mistakes as in 2010 after the financial crisis?  It remains important that everyone recognises that the recovery is not going to be a super-quick process. It will require sustained fiscal and monetary support. But the challenge is quite different from ten years ago. Many of the fiscal measures, the subsidy programmes for firms and workers, will automatically expire as the economy recovers. Then, tax revenues will recover. So large fiscal deficits will self-correct to a relevant extent in an automatic way. The other very important difference is that we've seen very large fiscal deficits but no current account deficits. The large fiscal deficits essentially have their counterpart in large household savings. We will have a kind of internal rebalancing over time. Households will start to spend more and that will offset governments which are spending less. So it's totally different to the kind of twin deficit problem we had ten or 15 years ago.  Nevertheless, sovereign debts have increased a lot during the pandemic. How worried should we be?  In 2008 interest rates were still relatively high and the most indebted countries faced the prospect of using a lot of their tax revenues and national income just to pay the bondholders. Now, we have a world in which many countries issue long-term debt at very low interest rates, so the financial burden of high sovereign debt is going to be very low.   What happens if the world changes and interest rates trend upwards?   We don't see this risk on the horizon. And even if it did emerge, much of the debt issued now is long term. International investors understand this: they are not requiring high risk premia to hold sovereign debt. So current levels of debt in today’s environment are not a source of concern to global investors – but, of course, governments will have to rebuild fiscal capacity once the recovery firmly takes hold.  If sovereign debt is not an issue, what is the main financial risk?  Staying with the pandemic, I would highlight the risk around corporates. Many corporates have lost revenues and survived only because of extensive fiscal support. We have to make sure that the phasing-out of these fiscal supports is not so quick or so severe that firms are unnecessarily pushed into insolvency.  What about a financial bubble?  I don't think we have the ingredients for that in Europe, I am not discussing what is happening elsewhere. For a true bubble, the usual risk calculations have to be ignored, like before 2008. We do not see that kind of loss of risk awareness. Today, European investors remain relatively cautious. Furthermore, various assets have gone up in value, but that's a rational response to a low interest rate world. And finally, a bubble is also usually amplified by a lot of debt. And, by and large, we’ve not seen debt-driven speculation on a pan-European basis.   Coming back to your point about yields being low, in Europe rates have steadily increased since December. The French ten-year bond yield went from -0.2% to +0.2%, Italy’s is close to 1%, Germany’s is getting close to zero. Shouldn't the ECB intervene more?  It’s true there have been increases in the ten-year rates, but it's important to recognise that yields remain relatively low and anchored, and we have a lot of stability in interest rates thanks to that. Also, all parts of the yield curve are important, because many firms might take out one-year loans, or three or five-year loans. Our overall commitment is to maintain favourable financing conditions. In March we concluded that we needed to step up significantly our asset purchases within the pandemic emergency purchase programme, and this higher level will continue over the coming weeks. We will review it again at our June meeting, when we assess the favourability of financing conditions together with the inflation outlook. And we can increase or decrease our purchases depending on what is necessary to keep financing conditions favourable.  The pandemic has brought to the fore the concept of European economic sovereignty. What does it mean? What are its limits? Should Europe do more for its main industries?  There is some confusion between the concept of sovereignty and the concept of being open. Having a very open economy is actually a very good platform for sovereignty. In the context of monetary sovereignty, the common currency is a very strong platform for sovereignty. Again, imagine what Europe would look like without a common currency. That said, sharing sovereignty, which is the basic definition of the European Union, would be reinforced by having a more complete banking union, a capital markets union, more integrated payment systems, a central bank digital currency... Before we think about European champions in the global marketplace, we must also ask ourselves: are we doing enough to make sure that the best firms in Europe can grow on a pan-European basis? We're far away from that. We do not have a true single market in Europe, in terms of the different types of goods, in services, but also in banking union and in capital markets.   There's been a lot of disruption in global trade because of the pandemic. Are we seeing some kind of deglobalisation?  Rather, we are now seeing a strong recovery in global trade. Trade has been very resilient and globalisation has played a powerful role in the most important issue for all of us now: the production of vaccines, which has been a global effort. It proves that the answer is not to build redundancies and closed loops in Europe, America or Asia. But we should minimise bottlenecks. If everyone is reliant on the same small number of producers for some essential components, or on exactly the same shipping routes, then there is clearly a concentration risk for trade.   "
2021-05-08,Frank Elderson,Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad,"Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annemiek Leclaire","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad   Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annemiek Leclaire 8 May 2021 The job interview with René Smits started as soon as I had come through security at De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). “Let’s take the stairs,” he said and began to race up two steps at a time, asking me the first questions on the way. It’s far easier to pose questions when you’re dashing upstairs than to answer them. By the time we arrived on the fourth floor I was out of breath. Smits had invited me for breakfast but I decided to have something at home first because I knew I wouldn’t manage to eat a bite.  I began my career at the law firm Houthoff Advocaten specialising in EU competition law. At the end of 1998, when stationed in Brussels, I was charged with researching an issue for a major customer: a US tobacco company whose billboards featured cowboys at sunset. The European Commission wanted to clamp down on those advertisements, and I was asked to explore whether we could stretch out the process.  In US films you sometimes see a young lawyer studying through the night in a library; that was me in Brussels. At three in the morning I had a flash of inspiration that allowed the customer to continue advertising for at least another six months, a period in which you can sell plenty of cigarettes. But when I woke up the next morning I had mixed feelings. It was terrific that I could tell my boss what I had found. But then again, what was I doing? My father was a doctor, as was my wife. I thought: I don’t want to spend the rest of my life working for large tobacco companies, I want to do something that I believe in. The legal profession had fantastic intellectual appeal, but there’s more to life than racking your brain; what are you ultimately using your brain for? I did some soul-searching: what really motivates me? Resoundingly, that was “Europe”. Some ten years earlier, as a grammar school student, I had written a final examination paper on the causes of the First World War. In 1913, just a year before the war broke out, people thought they were embarking on a century of peace. The first aeroplanes had flown, there was radio, you could telegraph each other and sail all over the world. An era of opportunities lay ahead. One year later saw the start of the worst carnage in the history of mankind, and two decades on it happened again. I read diary entries by people from that time who were equally well educated, listened to the same classical music, read the same Russian classics. I realised that there was unnervingly little difference between that time and our own. The only difference was that we knew how terribly wrong things could go. And that we had institutions such as the European Union, NATO, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations. None of these international bodies for cooperation existed at that time but they do now. I wanted to contribute to that cooperation, I just wasn’t sure how.  I spotted a job advert from DNB seeking lawyers to further shape the monetary union. It was after 1 January 1999, the euro had been born. You couldn’t yet withdraw it from ATMs, but legally it had seen the light of day. It would be great if I could contribute to that. During that interview René Smits, Head of Legal Services at DNB, impressively brought the idea of working for Europe to life. The European Central Bank had just been set up in Frankfurt. As its President, Wim Duisenberg was the first Dutch person on the ECB’s Executive Board. Smits said, “You’ve probably seen on television how things work at that table in Europe. The members of the ECB’s Executive Board are spread around the table among the governors of the national central banks. If you come to work here, I’ll bring you along and you will join the legal committee.” And indeed, already that autumn I sat beside him at such a table. Funnily enough, my current office is now two floors away from that very table. Smits asked me, “You’ve been a lawyer for four years and you’re now thinking of coming to work here; what will you actually be doing in ten years’ time?” “Maybe I’ll have your job by then”, I replied. I think that he found that a little presumptuous, because when introducing me to his two deputies, he said, “So now you have to tell these colleagues what you said.” Thinking that I should make it sound a little more modest, I said, “Oh yes, I think you asked what exactly I would be doing 15 years from now…” But he interrupted me with, “No, it wasn’t 15 years, it was ten!” The extraordinary thing is – and that’s how life plays out sometimes – that I actually did have that role within ten years. Another thing I remember is the trust that he expressed, telling me, “I have very high expectations of you.” I often thought about that afterwards. I saw it as an incentive, he was setting the bar high. When I began after the summer I made sure I knew all the documents that he had given me by heart.  My entire path within DNB which took me where I am today, and the fact that, if I so wished, I could now re-enter that plenary meeting room and sit on the same chair, lends a special significance to that interview with Smits.  ‘“Are you out of your mind?” my lawyer friends asked me. “That’s such a boring place!” But just imagine what kind of financial crisis could have erupted if there had been no European cooperation during the pandemic and no ECB. To be honest, the power of Europe is still my driving force.    "
2021-05-03,Luis de Guindos,Interview with La Repubblica,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni on 27 April 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with La Repubblica   Interview with Luis de Guindos, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni on 27 April 2021 3 May 2021  Are the euro area’s economic prospects likely to worsen in a scenario where coronavirus variants continue to multiply?  The current situation is bittersweet. The first quarter was weaker than we expected three months ago. On the other hand, the pace of vaccination is gaining momentum across Europe. This is good news, because it will have a major impact on the economy. For the time being, it is estimated that growth will be around 4%. We expect the second half of the year to be very positive, even if there is still uncertainty. We note elsewhere that as soon as vaccination accelerates – like in the United Kingdom, Israel or the United States – the situation normalises rapidly. I hope that we will be in a much better situation by early summer.  Mario Draghi presented a €248 billion recovery plan which also contains important structural reforms. The Italian Prime Minister has said that Italy’s destiny is on the line. You worked alongside him as Vice-President for two years at the ECB: in your opinion, can Draghi restore trust in Italy?   Mario Draghi has made a very important contribution to Europe and is now making a very important contribution to Italy. For the time being, his main contribution to Italy is that he is leading a unity government that has the support of a very large majority in Parliament. That’s very important. And the recovery plan for Italy will be key to determining the future of its economy. I also think that Draghi’s prestige and reputation have provided the glue for the unity we are seeing in the Italian Parliament. This is an excellent signal for Europe as a whole.  You knew him in your capacity as Vice-President. What’s his best quality?  He has extraordinary leadership skills, which he clearly demonstrated as President of the ECB. And this is the best quality to allow a country to look ahead with confidence.  You said that Italy’s recovery plan is important for the success of the country. As Europe’s largest plan, is it not also crucial for the continent’s recovery?  One of the problems associated with the impact of the pandemic is that its effects were very divergent. In 2020 the average decline in GDP was just under 7%. However, in the Nordic countries, the contraction stopped at 4-5%, while in countries such as Spain it reached 11%. Fiscal situations also differ widely between northern and southern Europe. That’s why NextGenerationEU (NGEU) is so important: to avoid overly large gaps between countries. It is also important that it will be financed by the common issuance of bonds, and that part of the funds will be allocated in the form of grants. Lastly, NGEU has been designed to help above all the countries most affected by the pandemic. These three elements make the plan vital. NGEU does not simply seek to be a source of funding for short-term projects, but also to stimulate potential growth in the medium term. This is also why the funds will have to be accompanied by reforms to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the Member States. That’s also why it needs to be implemented and launched very quickly. The Commission will also need to approve the different plans quickly.  European countries like Italy will also re-emerge from the pandemic with huge public debt. Some are asking for it to be reduced. What do you think?  This isn’t a solution. Not only would it be an infringement of the Treaty, and therefore unacceptable for the ECB, but it would also be an economic mistake.   Why?  On the one hand, if the debt were cancelled, national central banks would need to use the profits they make to cover the losses instead of using them to pay dividends to the governments, as they now do at the end of each year. And what’s more, a decision of this kind would jeopardise the credibility of the central bank and undermine the effectiveness of our policies.  The German Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe gave the green light, conditional on the German “own resources” law. It is feared that the final ruling will undermine any ambition to move forward with eurobonds in the future. Is this good or bad news?  It’s not for us to comment on court judgments. But if the European Commission is ever able to issue joint bonds for the first time, that will be because there was a political will to do so. And this seems to me to be an important step forward.   So eurobonds would be something positive.  When an agreement was reached on NGEU and its forms of financing, the markets reacted very positively. This happened because they saw the political will behind this agreement and because they understood that European governments were firmly committed to doing everything they could to deal with the consequences of the pandemic. We need to complete monetary union. And we need to complete banking union with the European deposit insurance scheme. Furthermore, we need to work on the capital markets union and to converge towards a European instrument to pursue a common fiscal policy.  China’s economy is picking up again; soon America’s will too. How risky is it that Europe’s recovery is lagging behind?  The situation in the United States is more comparable to the situation we have here in Europe. Still, in 2020 economic activity in the United States contracted only half as much as in the euro area. And now, according to the Federal Reserve, the US economy will grow very rapidly, by 6.5%. If you compare monetary policy programmes and fiscal stimulus on both sides of the Atlantic, they are similar. In 2020 the fiscal effort in Europe reached 8 percentage points of GDP, which was helped along by automatic stabilisers. And now we have NGEU, a generous and ambitious plan. The main difference is that it has not got off the ground yet, but I hope that it soon will, and we will then be able to quickly bridge the gap with the United States.  Nevertheless, this gap already seems to be having some unwanted side effects, at least for the ECB. The markets are jittery, they are worried inflation could increase in the United States and spread to Europe. Are these concerns justified?   The US recovery started earlier and it’s true that it has led to an increase in nominal yields for government bonds. This is natural given that we are starting to see things get back to normal. The vaccination rollout in the United States has been very fast, and their fiscal stimulus programme is very ambitious. And alongside the recovery, the markets also expect inflation to increase, which puts pressure on yields. At the ECB we have tried to counter this and we have succeeded: European bond yields have been very calm since March. The markets have understood that the United States are further ahead in the recovery cycle and that, based on the economic fundamentals, the pressure on yields was unjustified.  But there are still fears that the Fed could soon be forced to take a less accommodative stance, which would ramp up the pressure on the ECB.  The normalisation of monetary policy should go hand in hand with the normalisation of the economy. Once the pandemic is over and the economy starts to get back to normal, then obviously monetary policy will also have to start doing the same. An emergency programme like the pandemic emergency purchase programme is temporary by definition and designed to deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic. But – and this is key – any withdrawal of these extraordinary measures must occur in step with economic developments, and we need to pay extremely close attention to this. Phasing out stimuli too soon could stymie the recovery. At the same time, prolonging emergency measures for too long may run the risk of moral hazard as well as the zombification of parts of the European economy. So we need to take a balanced approach.  Some members of the ECB Governing Council are already calling for tapering in the light of a recovery in the second half of the year. Are they right to do so?  I don’t have any preconceived notions in this respect. The way in which the economy develops will be the deciding factor. If by speeding up the vaccination campaign we manage to have vaccinated 70% of Europe’s adult population by the summer and the economy starts to pick up speed, we may also start to think about phasing out the emergency mode on the monetary policy side. The manufacturing sector is already doing very well; services are still lagging behind but should soon be able to recover and close the gap with the industrial sector. We hope that in a year’s time the pandemic will be behind us, social distancing will be a memory and the economy will be back to pre-pandemic levels: monetary policy will have to adjust to that.  So you can think about raising interest rates?  No, that’s not what I said, I was referring to a cautious exit from the emergency programme, and I said that it should be managed with a great deal of prudence.  Are you concerned about the strengthening of the euro?  As you are aware, the exchange rate is not one of our monetary policy objectives. But it is definitely one of the most important variables when looking at macroeconomic trends. So we monitor it very closely to see what effect it might have on growth and inflation.   What course do you think inflation will take over the next few months?  We expect inflation to rise temporarily. It may even exceed 2% towards the end of the year, but this will only be because of temporary factors, such as soaring energy prices. On average, it will be 1.5% this year. We expect it to slow in 2022 and to stand at 1.4% in 2023.  As a result of NGEU, do you truly believe that the risk of countries like Germany speeding ahead and leaving the others behind has been averted? Germany has also invested a lot of its own money in the economy and had the fiscal space to do so. If the gaps between countries are too great, will this once again threaten the euro area’s resilience?  Excessive divergences between countries do indeed pose a threat to the euro area’s resilience. But the idea behind the recovery plan is exactly that, to prevent these excessive divergences from occurring. That’s why it was important that NGEU earmark more funds for the hardest hit countries like Italy and Spain. And this is especially true for countries such as Spain, whose economy is highly dependent on the services sector, which has been hit hardest by the pandemic.   Some people fear that the end of the pandemic – and debt moratoria – could trigger an avalanche of bankruptcies. Do you share these concerns?  It’s true that at the beginning of the crisis, one of the biggest concerns was the possibility that the crisis itself might be followed by a wave of bankruptcies, mainly in the tourism sector and services in general. That’s why it was important for some countries, including Italy and Spain, to provide financial support to the hardest hit sectors from the outset and decide to grant debt moratoria. This was also important to prevent the emergence of a vicious circle between sovereigns, banks and corporates. Again, in this situation, it will be crucial that these measures are withdrawn gradually and with a great deal of prudence after the crisis. Otherwise we run the risk of choking the recovery.  Do you think there is a risk of a new wave of non-performing loans and the zombification of part of the banking system?  As you know, there is always a lag between economic developments and changes to levels of non-performing loans. There will most likely be an increase in non-performing loans in the second half of the year, but we don’t expect it to be as acute as we feared at the start of the pandemic. Still, banks need to take timely action to minimise any cliff effects when the moratoria measures begin to expire.  There has been much talk of a digital euro. But following Facebook’s announcement that it would launch its own digital currency, “Diem”, is there a risk that Europe might be too late? Is the currency and the very existence of central banks under threat?  Central banks have played a key role worldwide in dealing with the pandemic and we must make sure we are also well equipped to deal with any future challenge, on all fronts. Our current focus is to deepen the analysis of how a digital euro should work and what it should look like to benefit European citizens and our economy. The Governing Council will decide around mid-2021 whether to initiate a project for the possible launch of a digital euro.    "
2021-04-29,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Dagens Industri TV,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gabriel Mellqvist on 29 April 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Dagens Industri TV   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gabriel Mellqvist on 29 April 2021 29 April 2021  Philip Lane, very nice to have you with us. The first question very broadly: in what shape is the European economy today?  We are very much at an inflection point. Until now, the first weeks of this year, the first months of this year, have really still been dominated by all of the measures we’ve needed to take to contain the virus. As we all know, the services sector in Europe has been very restricted by all of the lockdown measures. On the other hand, manufacturing has been quite resilient in these months because the world economy has been recovering, world trade has been recovering, and there are many European firms benefiting from that. And when we look ahead into May, into the summer, into later this year, with vaccinations now having made progress and more to come in the coming weeks, we will see a lifting of restrictions on the services sector.  So we do see a good rebound. We do see a good recovery throughout the rest of this year, so that is very much, if you like, a two-sided story. Looking backwards, the initial weeks have been very tough for many firms. When looking forward there will be a rebound, but I should say, of course, this is all in the context of this pandemic being a huge negative shock, and the fact we’re rebounding from the worst of it does not mean there’s a full recovery.  That sounds positive and reassuring, but even looking forward on a positive note, it looks like we’re heading into a recession. I believe Lagarde signalled a contraction last week. How much does that matter? Does that obscure the picture of a positive outlook going forward?  That’s what I was trying to refer to in relation to the first months of this year. We do think that the first quarter – which of course ended at the end of March – will have seen a slight contraction. There will have been a fall in output, but we do think the economy will be growing in May and in June, and even more strongly in the third quarter between July and September, with that momentum continuing into the autumn. If you take the whole year, 2021 together, we do think activity will be about 4 per cent above 2020 values. That doesn’t quite recover all of the losses from 2020, but it’s significant progress compared with where we are now.  You are often referred to as the Chief Economist of the ECB; can you talk a little bit about forecasting and making predictions in this very particular environment, with economies going into lockdown? Has it been dramatically different?  It’s definitely been different. But actually, pretty much exactly a year ago the ECB released its first pandemic scenarios. In those scenarios I think the staff did a really good job, because essentially you might focus on this quarter or that quarter, but in the grand scheme of the whole analysis, the central projection was built upon enough medical solutions being in place by summer 2021 that that’s when the recovery would really take hold. And that’s what we’re seeing. That one-year-ago forecast is holding up pretty well: that around now, the European economy would be about 4 percentage points below the pre-pandemic level. That’s broadly where we are, so actually I think we always have to look beyond the week-by-week or month-by-month fluctuation. When we think about looking a year ahead or 18 months ahead, those forecasts made a year ago have held up pretty well.  If you could summarise the crisis management from the central bank so far: any conclusions? Anything you wish you would’ve done differently?  At some point I do agree we should look backwards and really hold ourselves to account. But I think really there were three tasks. The first task was to stabilise markets a year ago, in March and April last year. The initial shock of the pandemic was affecting market stability everywhere and all central banks had to respond with a range of measures. Our second basic objective was to protect credit supply. We know recessions may be far worse if you add a banking problem on top of an economic problem. Through our various measures in monetary policy and supervision, that has so far been handled – banks have continued lending and providing credit, now, of course, with significant support from government guarantees. The third element was to make sure that monetary support, that interest rate policy – which of course these days is not just about the short-term policy rate that we control, but also through asset purchasing – that long-term rates are also low enough to support a recovery and support inflation momentum.  A very common critique against central banks in this crisis has been increased economic division through the crisis. Unemployment is still frustratingly high, while markets have been very, very strong. Any thoughts on this dynamic?  Let me make a sharp distinction: we do think that monetary policy has been very beneficial; I would challenge you in terms of in what way would a tighter monetary policy, would higher interest rates be helpful under this scenario? What is true, and maybe this is where the narrative is complicated, is that the pandemic has definitely been very asymmetric. We’ve seen record earnings this week from all sorts of technology firms, and indeed some investment banking firms. You can see many sectors have been insulated from the crisis, or have even benefited from the move to working from home, while there are so many people, and they’re typically young, disproportionately female, who work in the services sector and who have been burdened with all of the complications from home schooling and so on. So it’s been a very asymmetric recession, but also it’s unprecedented in the amount of fiscal support.  We’ve seen record-breaking fiscal responses to the crisis. I think this is really going to be a big issue for the next year or two. How do we navigate not just the economic rebound, but also the correct sequencing and timing of how all of those policy measures will make sure not just that we have a rebound, but that we have a recovery to a sustainable post-pandemic economy?  In that context, can you talk a little bit about possible market effects on your stimulus and your purchases? Will you also analyse how the corporate bond market, for example, could have been affected or changed by your purchases?  We do think it’s very important and, over time, the evidence is coming in more and more that the corporate sector purchase programme plays a very important role. Let me emphasise: of course it’s important for the large corporates to actually issue bonds. We know that many small businesses, microenterprises, individuals don’t directly participate in the bond market. What that programme does do is, by providing bond market credit for those types of firms, it gives the banks more lending capacity for small firms and for households. So it’s important, when we think about the corporate sector programme, that it should not be a narrow analysis that just focuses on the high-grade corporates who issue bonds, but the fact it has a lot of spill-over effects on the wider credit market and by supporting that type of lending. In fact it opens the door, it creates the space for banks to have a greater willingness and capacity to lend to small firms and to individuals.  Just a quick follow-up. When do you reach a point where you feel uncomfortable at how much of a country’s debt the ECB should own, or of a company’s debt products, say?  We definitely operate within parameters, but I would come back to the basic point: all of what we do has to be assessed compared to the monetary policy imperative. Essentially, all of our tools are calibrated to make sure that we have price stability, which in turn does require us to bring inflation up to a higher level. Below, but close to 2 per cent is our current target. It is very important for the long-term stability of the European economy to reach that target. All of our measures, including the asset purchases, are calibrated to that end. I think that balance is something we always keep in mind. We have a wide range of policy tools and by, if you like, balancing across the different policies we have: the interest rate, the targeted lending scheme, asset purchases and of course our forward guidance about the future calibration of these policies, I think we manage that balance.  Speaking of the balance, I’d say that you’re not so worried about the fear of inflation that’s been tormenting markets lately. Can I also ask you about the inflation target? Do you at all look at an American-style, more average inflation target?  The deeper analysis, which I think the world shares, behind that is essentially that it’s very important in this world where we do have a lower bound on interest rates, where we do have currently low inflation, that everyone concerned should understand that the inflation targets set by central banks are symmetric, that these are not ceilings. One way to make sure that people understand that the centre of the distribution needs to be anchored by the inflation target is that central banks are willing to see inflation not only be below that target but above that target. One way to express that is by emphasising in a flexible way, as the Fed always advertises, average inflation targeting. But actually I think it’s not necessarily the only way and, as you know, we have a strategy review on right now to explore in the European context, in the context of where we are now, which is different from where the Fed is, what the best way to think about our inflation target should be.  Speaking of strategy, I’d like to bring one more central bank into the discussion. The Swedish Riksbank does seem reluctant to go back into negative territory. The ECB has been more comfortable, or at least has been in negative territory for a long time. Any advice or any conclusion from your experience that you would like to share?  I’m sure it’s going to be very unsurprising for you to know that I’m not going to comment directly on the policies of the Riksbank. What I would say is, the Riksbank and the ECB – all the major central banks – we study each other’s policies. We learn from each other’s conditions. Essentially, there is no direct read-across because of course where Sweden is in terms of its inflation momentum is different from where the euro area is. So I would not particularly dwell on any differences across the different central banks. If you look at the conditions we face, Europe faces a condition, the euro area faces a condition where we consider negative rates under current conditions to be essential, to be valuable, to be effective. But of course under other conditions, when inflation momentum is a lot stronger, the reaction may be different. Let me emphasise – I read of course all the Riksbank literature – I don’t think this is a statement that negative interest rates are ineffective. Under the conditions that the euro area faces, we continue to assess that this is an essential and valuable part of our current policy toolkit.  One last question involving the Riksbank: Sweden has been looking at digital currencies for quite some time. More central banks are doing this as of right now. What are your thoughts on central bank digital currencies?  When you see a phenomenon, which is essentially now a global effort to look at it, it’s some combination of being more optimistic that the technologies can be developed. Given our role in the world of payments and how money is exchanged across people, we do think there are potential gains to society from this. Sometimes that’s a bit mysterious because, of course, payment systems work quite well from the point of view of the consumer. But when you look at the overall costs of how payments are made, having a central bank digital currency may actually be something that unlocks efficiencies, reduces costs. Even if those may not be upfront, visible to every consumer, from society as a whole, those efficiencies, those gains may be quite important. It’s important for central banks, if they see possibilities in a safe way, in a stable way, to help make progress in society along this important dimension, I think it’s incumbent upon us to look and study this carefully.

2021-04-28,Isabel Schnabel,Q&A on Twitter,"Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 28 April 2021","   INTERVIEW  Q&A on Twitter   Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 28 April 2021 28 April 2021 Hello, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I’m looking forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Join the conversation! #AskECB   Does the ECB, like the Bank of China, also plan to conduct climate stress tests in the financial sector in the future to expand the tools for risk analysis in the area of green monetary policy? What further measures are planned here?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is currently implementing an economy-wide climate stress test to analyse the vulnerability of firms and euro area banks to physical and transition risks. The potential impact on the portfolios of non-banks will also be considered. #AskECB. #AskECB  To find out more about the ECB’s economy-wide climate stress test, please refer to a recent article by our Vice President Luis de Guindos published on the ECB blog: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2021/html/ecb.blog210318~3bbc68ffc5.en.html   What is the ""monthly reference"" amount for the PEPP decided on 11 March? Or As we all acknowledge that the  @ecb  had flexibility under this amount and that it can change it at any time as needed, why not simply disclosing this monthly ‘target’?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Preserving favourable financing conditions shifts the focus from quantities to prices – the conditions at which sovereigns, firms & households can receive funding. Monthly volumes vary, as we continue to buy flexibly according to market conditions. #AskECB   What’s the reason not to cancel the debt that ECB has bought through QE, given that central banks create money out of thin air? #askECB     @Isabel_Schnabel: Debt cancellation is not an option. It would constitute monetary financing and violate the Treaties. It would also call into question the ECB’s commitment to its price stability mandate and undermine the rule of law and the independence of the ECB. #AskECB   #AskECB what is ECB's view on the rising housing costs?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Rising housing costs are a burden for many people and may give rise to financial stability risks. In our #strategyreview we discuss how to better capture housing costs in our inflation measure. But we do not target asset prices. #AskECB   What the  @ecb  is thinking about the call of cancellation of national debts?  #AskECB     @Isabel_Schnabel: A cancellation of national debts would constitute a clear violation of the European Treaties. The debate is harmful and should be stopped. #AskECB   #AskECB Isabel, Have TLTRO programs served purpose of reviving real economy or creating asset bubbles as some funds have gone to financial markets enabling buybacks and higher stock prices   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) have been crucial in supporting bank lending to households and firms. This has helped to avoid a credit crunch at the height of the pandemic. #AskECB   Is it what happened in the first few weeks of April? #AskECB     @Isabel_Schnabel: The weekly change in the Eurosystem’s PEPP holdings (at amortised cost) at the beginning of April was affected by redemptions, the reduced number of trading & settlement days due to the Easter holidays and the quarter-end amortisation adjustment. #AskECB   #AskECB  is the ECB concerned about the profitability of the banking sector especially in Germany and about the diminishing relevance of European banks in the world?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The low profitability of euro area banks, also compared to global competitors, has been a reason for concern for quite some time. That’s why bank profitability is one of the key priorities for our banking supervisors in 2021: https://bankingsupervision.europa.eu/banking/priorities/priorities/html/index.en.html #AskECB   #AskECB @Isabel_Schnabel if there is currently no incentive to save with EUR (negative interest rates and shrinkage of purchasing power), what is your suggestion to the problem?   No Savings at all? Just finance everything out of Credit? Accumulation of assets for saving reason?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Even in a low interest rate environment saving is needed to transfer income to the future. What matters are real not nominal interest rates. Ideally savings are diversified across different asset classes according to individual risk preferences. #AskECB   #AskECB Who, which entity, that is democratically-accountable and subject to the will of actual voters, controls, and may sanction, the actions and decisions of the ECB?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We are accountable to all European citizens through the European Parliament. The President and other Executive Board members regularly participate in public hearings and explain the ECB’s policies to EU parliamentarians and the public. #AskECB  If you want to find out more, have a look at our explainer on accountability: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/tell-me/html/about-ecb-accountability.en.html   According to a recent speech by an ECB official, PEPP purchases could be scaled down : if it were to occur, could other parameters of the programme be adjusted accordingly (e.g. reinvestment horizon, WAM of the purchases). Thank you  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: PEPP was designed to deal with the pandemic and its duration is linked to the pandemic crisis phase. We are free to adjust any parameters of the programme at any point in time if required to fulfil our price stability mandate. #AskECB   The Apr BLS shows again a tightening of credit standards in Q2 after a few quarters of tightening. Are you concerned about this and do you believe additional TLTROs operations into 2022 could change this picture?  #AskECB     @Isabel_Schnabel: Bank lending rates remain near historically low levels, while the most recent bank lending survey showed a further tightening in credit standards, but more moderately than in previous survey rounds. We are carefully monitoring bank lending conditions.#AskECB   How does the  @ecb react to a scenario where inflation is near-target but growth remains slow?E.g. the emergence of supply-side inflation from bottlenecks (supply chain disruption/ delays) + geopolitical risk (production onshoring).  #askecb @Isabel_Schnabel   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our inflation aim is defined over the medium term. This gives us flexibility to deal with supply-side shocks like temporary bottlenecks. Our current forecast suggests that inflation remains subdued over the projection horizon: https://ecb.europa.eu/pub/projections/html/index.en.html #AskECB   #AskECB : some increase in real yields seems to be warranted if the recovery is happening as projected - how much would be in line with your tolerance and would you increase PEPP if the yld increase exceeds the range you'd tolerate   @Isabel_Schnabel: Theoretically this depends on how real interest rates compare to real equilibrium rates. In practice this has to be judged in light of current and expected economic and inflation developments. The envelope may not be used in full or expanded as needed. #AskECB   #AskECB @Isabel_Schnabel Are there any side-effects of the  #ECB ’s monetary policy? E.g. asset price inflation? What is the impact on #inequality? Are we getting closer to bubble territory? See e.g.  #Bitcoin ,  #Dogecoin ,  #SPACs   @Isabel_Schnabel: Any policy measure is subject to side effects, monetary policy is no exception. We assess the proportionality of our measures by weighing their benefits and costs. Side effects like financial instability and inequality are important parts of that. #AskECB   #AskECB is the ECB taking into account asset prices when setting its monetary policy instruments?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Financial stability is a prerequisite for price stability and is related to our primary mandate. Therefore we carefully monitor the build-up of risks in the financial sector. Overvalued asset prices are one aspect, but we do not target asset prices. #AskECB   Does the ECB take into the count the posibility that other Central Banks begin the tapering sooner that expected because the speed of the recovery is started to accelerate in some countries?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy depends on economic conditions in the euro area and, in particular, on our medium-term inflation outlook. Business cycles vary across countries around the world, and so does monetary policy. #AskECB   Could the phasing out of the PEPP in 2022 come along with a recalibration of the APP (greater flexibility) and TLTROs (longer maturities and discount period)? #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: We will have to carefully manage the transition from the pandemic to the post-pandemic period. This may include a recalibration of our regular tools and will take into account the outcome of our monetary policy #strategyreview. #AskECB   #AskECB  how do you see your role regarding consumption promoting policy and consumptions catalyzing effect on carbon emissions?   Your real mean of power is monetary policy. Current situation, you may be wrongly assesing cost of long term stability compared to short term stability    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB’s primary mandate is price stability. Physical and transition risks from climate change may affect price stability, which should be taken into account in our monetary policy. How this can be done is discussed in our ongoing. #strategyreview #AskECB   The ECB has missed the inflation target for years, by nearly 1% for at least 10 years. Would you accept to overshoot by 1% in the next 10 years?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our medium-term inflation aim is symmetric: we counter deviations to the upside and to the downside equally. We are currently reviewing our price stability objective in our #strategyreview, which will also address the question of overshooting. #AskECB   How can you retain any credibility when you’ve kept negative interest rates for 6 years, continue to expand QE, deny inflation then say you need to do more? It’s a busted flush   @Isabel_Schnabel: The best measure of our credibility is price stability. The euro has been very stable since its inception. Due to disinflationary shocks, including severe crises, inflation has fallen below our aim. But it would be even lower without our measures. #AskECB   Will EU non-member states ever be able to adopt the euro as their primary currency and sole legal tender?   @Isabel_Schnabel: EU membership is a key prerequisite. But there are exceptions. The euro is also used outside the European Union and beyond the European continent. You can find the full list and the specific reasons in our explainer: https://ecb.europa.eu/explainers/show-me/html/euro_outside_europe.en.html. #AskECB   with excess liquidity at record levels above 4 trn euros, banks are beginning to transfer costs to their clients. Is the ECB considering further measures against this, and is a change in the tiering sistem under consideration?  @Isabel_Schnabel   #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: The two-tier system has been successful in alleviating the side effects from negative interest rates for banks. If we were to observe risks to the bank-based monetary transmission from rising excess liquidity, the tiering multiplier could be adjusted. #AskECB   What is the intrinsic value of the Euro?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: The intrinsic value of the euro depends on its purchasing power. This is ensured by the ECB, which is independent & bound by its price stability mandate. The Eurobarometer shows record levels of support for the euro. Moreover the euro is legal tender. #AskECB  If you want to find out more about the support for the euro, please refer to the latest Eurobarometer publication: https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2355   To what extent are other G10 central bank actions (e.g., BOC tapering, UK monetary/fiscal coordination, Fed’s AIT framework, BOJ’s equity ETF purchases, etc.) influencing ECB policy and/or the ECB strategy review? #AskECB     @Isabel_Schnabel: We conduct our monetary policy on the basis of domestic economic conditions. But the international financial and economic system is highly integrated, which implies spillovers of monetary and fiscal policy, for example through global growt. #AskECB   Why considers the ECB the climate to their monetary mandate?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Since climate change affects price stability through physical & transition risks, we must take it into account under our primary mandate. Without prejudice to our price stability objective, we are also obliged to support general EU economic policies. #AskECB   #AskECB Fed Chair Powell personally owns $42m in stocks and bonds (per US regulatory ethics disclosures), which many believe is a direct conflict of interest. Does the ECB also have ethics disclosures publically available, showing the Executive Board members' financial assets?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB indeed has strict compliance rules, which limit the Governing Council members’ ability to hold and trade financial assets and require them to annually publish their financial holdings. #AskECB  Please see the following page for our most recent declarations of interest: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/access_to_documents/document/declarations/shared/pdf/ecb.dr.dec210322_declarations_of_interest.en.pdf?ca0b3c64595c06b79644a9c1b5d6fe30   #AskECB dear Ms Schnabel, how can the ecb be credible saying it expects a significant increase in monthly net PEPP purchases in the quarter following the mid March meeting, when in fact there has only been one credible step up in the pace in the last week but nothing huge   @Isabel_Schnabel: This is a misperception. As announced, we have significantly stepped up monthly net asset purchases under the PEPP. Due to reasons explained in a recent Twitter thread, this is not always visible in the weekly numbers. #AskECB   #AskECB One more question. Am i right that  #ECB   #FED   #lagarde   #JPOW  still does not see any signs of  #inflation ?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Price changes of particular goods are not the same as general inflation. We are currently seeing price increases for some goods, like lumber, which may eventually be transmitted to consumer prices, depending on their weight in the consumption basket. #AskECB   #AskECB @Isabel_Schnabel Aren’t we in a liquidity trap? What than is the purpose of the  #ECB ’s monetary policy? To keep treasury yields low ( #FinancialRepresson ) and spreads tight?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We expect a rebound of the economy in H2 2021 when containment measures are lifted & large parts of the population are vaccinated. But inflation is currently projected to remain low in the medium term, which justifies our highly accommodative stance. #AskECB   #AskECB  Wie lange sollen die Minuszinsen noch laufen? Wer zahlt all diese Schulden? Wann heben Sie die Zinsen wieder an, siehe Kanada? Was raten Sie Sparern? Wie soll man Altersvorsorge betreiben?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The inflation outlook is still well below our inflation aim of below but close to 2%. Monetary policy has to remain accommodative, including very low interest rates, to get the economy back on track, in line with our price stability mandate. #AskECB   #AskECB  Most people would think an inflation target of close to but below 2% as not symmetrical. Moreover that target has been in operation for twenty years and given it is rarely if ever met why not change it to say 1.5%?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our introductory statements clearly state that our inflation aim is symmetric. Lowering the inflation aim would carry the risk of hitting the effective lower bound more frequently. The definition of price stability is discussed in our #strategyreview.#AskECB   #AskECB  Dear  @Isabel_Schnabel , Here is GDP for  #JP  in USD. Since they implemented QEs & low rates in the 90s, it stopped growing. How, by applying the same recipes,  #EU  could have another outcome? Isn't time to move money from Markets to the economy?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Asset purchases, low interest rates and bank refinancing operations support favourable financing conditions for households, firms and the government across the euro area. Without these measures, the outlook for growth and inflation would be worse. #AskECB   Do you consider to use a more meaningful formula to measure inflation anytime soon? Your CPI is manipulated and everyone that has seen a supermarket from inside knows that.  #askecb   @Isabel_Schnabel: The HICP is calculated independently by Eurostat, not the ECB. It reflects actual consumption patterns. The prices of products from the supermarket do not reflect our full consumption basket, which also includes rents, services or electronic products. #AskECB   Would it be a trade-off for monetary policy if the inflation rate will overshoot its target probably this year or next year, while the economic recovery is not that robust?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our focus is on medium-term price stability. Current inflation developments show substantial volatility due to various one-off and temporary effects. We look through such short-term developments. #AskECB   #AskECB what is your advice to women interested in pursuing a career as an executive or non-exec board member at ECB?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB aims at improving gender equality at all levels. Therefore we recently set new ambitious gender targets and have implemented numerous measures to increase diversity, including but not only related to gender equality. So please apply to the ECB! #AskECB   #askecb When is the Digital Euro coming ?   @Isabel_Schnabel: This summer the Governing Council of the ECB will decide whether to launch an investigation on the digital euro. After that, we will take the decision whether to launch a digital euro. The implementation would take several years. #AskECB   #AskECB The m3/GDP ratio has gone up from mid 70% at the beginning of this century to currently way over 100% What would be an about right ratio or range? What has that range historically been?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy is guided by our price stability objective. Over the past decades, the relationship between monetary aggregates and inflation has weakened. Therefore, our monetary analysis has put a stronger focus on monetary transmission. #AskECB   Why do i have to pay taxes when we can just print money? #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Taxes are a means to finance the activities of the government. According to Article 123 of the EU Treaty, there is a prohibition of monetary financing of governments by the ECB. #AskECB   #AskECB Let's imagine food inflation is going out of control so consumer spending will crash and stagflationary environment arrives. Does it mean CPI will show inflation or deflation? as spending for consumer goods is removed. How ECB can deal with such environment?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Food accounts for a large share of the consumption basket. Spikes in food inflation thus push up overall inflation. HICP weights are adjusted on an annual basis by Eurostat to reflect shifts in consumption. We look through short-term volatility. #AskECB  You can find out more about changes in consumption patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in our Economic Bulletin: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2020/html/ecb.ebbox202007_03~e4d32ee4e7.en.html   Why don’t we let natural deflationary forces in western democracies happen due to demographics, debt, technology and globalization? Why aren’t prices allowed to fall? Is it bad when free market prices fall and create a natural equilibrium through supply and demand?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Most economists agree that deflation has worse economic consequences than small positive inflation. It leads to a deepening of recessions when agents postpone consumption & investment in expectation of falling prices resulting in a deflationary spiral. #AskECB   Dear Ms  @Isabel_Schnabel , why does the ECB not ask independent economic scholars and other academics to judge its strategy review of monetary policy of the last 10 years, instead of conducting that review itself? #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: We have indeed involved academics in our strategy review process through an Academic Roundtable and through our annual ECB Forum on Central Banking (“Sintra”). We have also had numerous informal exchanges with economists from all over the world. #AskECB   #AskECB Hello! We're organizing citizens panels about the ECB strategy review in France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Will you accept to meet with randomly selected citizens at the end fo the process, and take their recommendations into consideration?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Your initiative is very welcome. We have conducted numerous listening events ourselves and will continue to do so. The feedback from citizens is one important input into our strategy review. #AskECB  Time to wrap up. Thanks a lot for your questions – I really enjoyed the chat and look forward to doing it again soon. Take care! #AskECB    "
2021-04-12,Christine Lagarde,Interview with CNBC,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Sara Eisen on 9 April 2021 and broadcast on the same day","   INTERVIEW  Interview with CNBC   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Sara Eisen on 9 April 2021 and broadcast on the same day 12 April 2021  Europe is at an interesting point, because there’s a lot of optimism about a recovery, and yet Europe is still in the throes of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis – high cases, lockdowns. What is your level of concern at this point about the system and the economy as the President of the ECB?  Well, I think there is recovery – it is delayed, certainly, but it’s not derailed. It is delayed because Europe has been hit by the third wave of the virus. Not exactly the same one – the one that we call the English variant, which has hit most European countries hard. So we are still going through some lockdown measures. Not as severe as a year ago, but it is still slowing down the economy, which is back in many ways, because there has been a lot of ingenuity on the part of the private sector, in particular, to resist the slowing down of the measures. So a lot of invention, a lot of innovation, a lot of ways to deal with a situation that is still a preoccupation and that still inflicts a lot of uncertainty. I think – as everybody else has said – light is at the end of the tunnel. We can see it. It’s not yet within touching distance. We still have a few innings to go. But certainly in 2021, in the second half of the year there will be recovery that will be moving fast, actually.  That’s good to hear. In your latest action, you announced that you’re going to ramp up bond purchases to counter the rise that we’ve seen in yields, which we’ve seen here in the United States as well. My question is why, if rising yields are a sign of the optimism about the economy and higher inflation, do you need to fight that?  When the Governing Council met earlier in March, we had observed for a few weeks a rapid increase in the risk-free interest rates of the sovereign bond yields. And we thought that this was undesirable and unwarranted, and that it would lead to some tightening that was, as I said, not warranted by the economic situation that we saw in Europe. And we didn’t want those risks of tightening to jump ahead of an economic recovery that could occur in Europe probably during the second half of 2022. So a lot of it was actually imported from the United States, and we thought it was perfectly appropriate to resist this risk of tightening and to make sure that we could continue to preserve the favourable financing conditions that we pledged back in December.  So are you satisfied to see yields back lower today?  I think that our action has been efficient. I think it’s been efficient ever since we started back in March 2020. I think that markets have understood what we want to do, how we want to preserve favourable financing conditions, and apply that joint assessment based on what we see on the financing conditions that are out there and our inflation aim. And particularly our determination to return to a pre-COVID-19 state, and then move on to our actual inflation aim.  You are expecting a rebound this year, as you mentioned, but do you think there is a possibility that you’ll have to extend the pandemic emergency bond-buying programme beyond March 2022 when it’s set to end? Is there a chance of that?  This pandemic emergency programme is characterised by complete flexibility – flexibility across time, across asset classes, across countries – and we decided when it was needed to extend it and to expand it. We did it twice. If it is necessary to do it again, we will do it again. If it is necessary to spend more than what has been identified, we will do so. If we can spend less because the situation improves fast, we will do so as well. So we will use the flexibility in all respects. And the commitment that we have under the pandemic emergency programme is to make sure that it supports the economy and helps us reach our goal of price stability, up until such time when the Governing Council decides that the pandemic crisis is over. We’ve assumed that it would be March – up until now. If it needs to be extended because the Governing Council determines that the crisis is likely to last longer, we will extend it.  What about tapering? How big of a challenge is that going to be, in this environment, and is it too optimistic to expect that you might start tapering before the end of the year, given the forecast?  I think you’re thinking of tapering in US-like terms. We are in a completely different situation. The United States is probably going to hit its inflation targets rather soon. We are very far away from that. In 2021 we will probably see inflation at 1.5%, and that is largely temporary and technical. It will go down again, we think. And our goal is close to, but below, 2%. So we’re very far away from that. And what we tried to do with our forward guidance is indicate that we will continue net asset purchases until very close to the time when we will actually look at raising policy rates, which will have an impact on interest rates. So tapering should not be discussed in the same terms as in the United States. We may well reduce the pandemic emergency programme when the time comes, when we see the crisis coming to an end. Yes, but that’s the emergency programme. We also have another programme of asset purchases. And as I said, net asset purchases will continue until we start looking at raising policy rates.  When do you expect Europe to reach herd immunity? I know you’re not a virologist, but it’s obviously a critical economic question.  I would not make any pronouncements on herd immunity, because doctors and scientists are arguing about that. What I can tell you is that there is a very strong determination to reach 70% of vaccinations before the end of the summer. And for some countries, it will move faster. I know that there is a commitment to have a very sizeable part of the population in France vaccinated before Bastille Day, which is 14 July. We’ll see about that. But certainly before the end of the summer, 70% of the population vaccinated is something that seems to be very much within reach. Because now vaccination rollout is picking up, it is getting speedier and more efficient than it was in the last few weeks, which I think the Europeans are now really dealing with and addressing with determination. I think we have to keep up and press on to make sure that injections are taking place fast.  What about stimulus injections? Obviously, the United States has just had a USD 2 trillion bazooka, and there’s another USD 2 trillion package potentially on the table. The European recovery fund hasn’t been signed off on and is about half as big, is that frustrating for you?  Well, if you put together the whole package that was agreed by the Europeans, which is this special fund, plus the multi-annual budget, you get to about USD 2.2 trillion. That is roughly the ballpark figure that we have. When I say the Europeans, we, have to keep up and press on, that’s what I mean. It has been agreed, it has been voted by the European Parliament, all 27 Member States have to ratify. I know that 16 of them have done so. They still have a few weeks to make sure that funds are actually disbursed in the second half of 2021. That’s what we’re counting on in terms of our projections. So pressing on is in order now.  But is it adequate enough, the size, and the scope, given the trillions of dollars we’ve seen from the United States, and given some of the economic hurdles that you have in front of you? It would certainly make your life easier, wouldn’t it, if they could go bigger on fiscal actions?  Well, it was great that during this crisis fiscal and monetary acted hand-in-hand, and this has to continue. It’s difficult to compare, because we’re comparing oranges and apples here. Europe has much higher automatic stabilisers than the United States. The recovery plan and the resilience plan here is really targeted at quality measures and making sure that there is transition towards digital, green, productivity-enhancing measures, whereas the US plan is demand-driven, at least the first big chunk of it. The second one will be of a different nature, I’m sure, when it is voted.  But it’s difficult to actually compare, because you also have national measures that are taken and that provide fiscal stimulus as well. So you need to package everything at the European level and possibly compare it. But I’m not even sure that this is actually appropriate, because they are clearly tailored in a different way. Europe wants to really beef up its game. Be more digital, more green, more effective. And for the moment, as I understand the United States voted part of the plan, it’s demand-driven, it’s improving the vaccination process with great efficiency. And this is very good news for the world as well.  The European stocks have been on a tear lately, they’ve just regained their pre-pandemic highs, record levels. European bonds have rallied, even ones with weak balance sheets. The euro has been strong over the past year against the dollar. Do you see the markets, or any part of the markets, as being detached a little from the reality on the ground?  We monitor that very carefully. As you know, we don’t target any particular exchange rate, for instance. We are very attentive to the impact that it has on inflation, obviously. But we need to make sure that from a macroprudential and a microprudential point of view, the banks are properly equipped and the regulatory authorities are properly equipped to deal with what would be unwarranted movements. But we don’t see that at the moment.  And finally, one question I’ve been asking all of the world leaders, that I would love to hear your thoughts on, is what keeps you up at night? What is the central risk that would worry you about this more optimistic forecast, coming out of the pandemic?  I’ll tell you what worries me, and this is not necessarily a central bank governor’s main preoccupation traditionally. But what preoccupies me a lot is that those who are going to be crushed most out of this current pandemic and economic crisis are women, particularly young women. And I’m very concerned that the ground that we had gained over the last few years not be lost and that they eventually lose out most as a result of this situation. So you know, I think of my little girls.   Well, luckily, we have many strong women leading us in this economic recovery. Thank you so much, President Lagarde. I appreciate it.  Thank you.   "
2021-04-11,Fabio Panetta,Interview with El País ,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luis Doncel and published on 11 April 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with El País    Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luis Doncel and published on 11 April 2021 11 April 2021  The recovery in the euro area is still very fragile, and the vaccine rollout is progressing slowly. How is this slow progress affecting the economy?   Uncertainty has receded to some extent, but is still high. The vaccine rollout is accelerating but remains slow. And in a number of countries the pandemic is spreading fast, which is weighing on the economic outlook. While the US economy will return to its pre-crisis levels this year, we will not do so before mid-2022. And, unlike the United States, we will not return to our pre-crisis growth path, meaning that we may have permanently lost two years of growth. Inflation is projected to remain well below our 2% target in the medium term, compared with around 2% in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. We need more ambition to help economic activity reach its potential and see inflation converge towards our aim. And we need to give consumers and investors more certainty about the prospects for the European economy.   After an Easter week without tourists, it is still not clear whether or not summer can be saved. The prospect of a recovery keeps moving further and further away. Do you think the Spanish Government’s forecasts for this year are too optimistic?  In general, it would not be prudent to bet on a rapid recovery. There may be risks associated with expecting improvements that in the end may not materialise. And even if we do manage to exit the pandemic soon, we will realise that there is actually more damage to the economic fabric than is currently visible. There is nothing to prevent a stronger recovery in the euro area, which will limit this damage, but the economy must receive the necessary amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus. A truly prudent policy approach calls for leaning towards injecting too much stimulus rather than too little.   Many analysts fear that the recovery may be uneven across countries. Are you worried about the potential harm to Spain or Italy if stimulus is withdrawn early?   There is a significant risk of divergence. The pandemic has affected each country differently, depending on its exposure to the most affected sectors. But there has been a common European response. We can have a more uniform exit from the crisis by using the €750 billion available under the EU recovery instrument – NextGenerationEU – wisely, and this should be accompanied by the necessary reforms in each country. If the funds are invested in future-oriented growth sectors, the recovery will be more balanced. If successful, this plan could serve as a prototype for a future common fiscal instrument.   Should Europe follow the United States’ example and provide greater fiscal stimulus?   The United States’ fiscal stimulus programme is ambitious, especially this year, and that is a key reason why our growth paths are diverging. Committing to “run the economy hot” is beneficial for employment, investment and productivity growth. And a faster recovery helps the poorest members of society. In Europe, we have to make the EU recovery instrument operational so that the European Commission can start making disbursements soon. And we should consider providing more fiscal support to help drive demand back to its potential level faster.  The German Federal Constitutional Court has just blocked ratification of the EU recovery plan, which was already running behind schedule. Are you worried that the funds may not arrive in time?   I really hope the Court takes a decision as soon as possible. We need European funds to be released quickly. All Member States, including Germany, will benefit from a faster and stronger European recovery.  A year has passed since the ECB launched its biggest programme to tackle the coronavirus crisis. Are you concerned about the increase in debt market yields?   In December we increased the pandemic emergency purchase programme to €1.85 trillion and in March we accelerated the pace of purchases. These decisions have been very effective. They are protecting the European bond market, and European nominal sovereign yields have partly decoupled from US yields. That, in turn, has exerted downward pressure on real interest rates, adding stimulus to the recovery. We saw the risk that the increase in yields in the United States could spill over to the euro area. If we hadn’t intervened, the tightening of financing conditions would have had a negative impact on growth and inflation in Europe. With inflation projections still way below 2%, we couldn’t accept a tightening of financing conditions, irrespective of its cause or origin – this would have been inconsistent with our policy mandate. Favourable financing conditions are an intermediate target for achieving our primary objective, which is inflation close to 2%.   At a time when the euro area is unable to get close to the 2% objective, some economists are ringing alarm bells about unwanted inflation in the United States as a result of President Biden’s stimulus plan. Is the era of very low inflation coming to an end?  In the United States inflation is seeing a return to healthy levels because monetary and fiscal policies are working forcefully together. In the euro area the medium-term inflation outlook is unsatisfactory. Inflation will temporarily increase this year due to some transitory factors that will fade out in 2022. However, with a more dynamic policy mix, we could also fully benefit from the improved global outlook.  After playing a major role in the last crisis, central bankers once again find themselves in the eye of the storm. Are these superpowers, which at one time appeared temporary, now permanent?  The best way to make central bankers less relevant in the future is to ensure that the economy improves and inflation reaches its objective. I would love for us to go back to being seen as boring. We probably already are, but I want to be even more so [laughs]. That would be the sign that we have delivered.   Quoting Daft Punk lyrics is not typical for a boring speech by a central banker. You were calling for more urgency from the ECB.  I wanted to highlight the high cost of delaying essential decisions. This doesn’t mean that we need to act with urgency all the time. My call for more action was specific to a situation like the one we’re in now, where we are far away from our inflation aim. We should only take action when necessary, but if you delay you end up having to take even more action at a later date. We have experienced this situation in the past.   Some of your more hawkish northern European colleagues on the Governing Council may think differently...  Views on the speed of decision-making may vary, but there is agreement on the direction of monetary policy. Here, I have to acknowledge the key role of President Lagarde. In a period of high uncertainty, reflected in different views on the outlook, she has managed to obtain unanimity or a hefty majority for all the decisions we have taken.  Given the magnitude of the crisis, should the ECB expand its toolbox?  We do have room for manoeuvre because so far we have only used part of the €1.85 trillion envelope. But if we spend this money and still fall short of the objective, then we will need to do more. We cannot be satisfied with inflation at 1.2% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023. The argument that we could extend the horizon to meet the aim is not a convincing one. The ECB has failed to reach its aim for too many years already. Waiting will be even more costly. It would make it more difficult to re-anchor inflation expectations and we would risk a permanent reduction of economic potential.   How are the assessments on the launch of a digital euro coming along?  A digital euro would offer all Europeans a form of sovereign money to make secure digital payments anywhere in the euro area free of charge while protecting their privacy. In the coming months, the Governing Council will decide whether or not we should launch a formal project to get ready to issue a digital euro. We will analyse all key factors, including compliance with anti-money laundering and tax evasion regulations. We want to understand all the implications before taking a decision on its introduction. If these intermediate steps are successful, we could be ready to launch the digital euro within five years.   Are you not worried about falling behind other countries, like China?  China started work on a digital currency in 2013 and is more advanced. Canada and Sweden are also further along. In the euro area we are in a similar position to the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. But this is not a race. There is too much at stake. We will learn from each other and cooperate.   During talks held with stakeholders in the last few months, have you been able to allay their concerns about a digital euro?  We are well aware of the risks that a digital euro, if not properly designed, could pose to financial stability, but there are ways to avoid them. We are going to proceed with the utmost caution and this should reassure banks and intermediaries. Under no circumstances will we compromise financial stability or financial intermediation.  The ECB’s strategy review is ongoing. How are the discussions progressing on fighting climate change and changing the inflation aim from “below, but close to, 2%” to the more direct formulation of 2%?  Nothing has been decided yet. We are discussing the optimum aim. My view is that 2% is the most suitable level, and it should be symmetrical. As for climate change, our primary objective is price stability, but we also want to incorporate this important factor. President Lagarde is committed to the ECB doing its part to fight climate change. We will provide an answer later this year.   "
2021-04-09,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Der Spiegel,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tim Bartz and Stefan Kaiser on 1 April and published on 9 April 2021, in print on 10 April 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Der Spiegel   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tim Bartz and Stefan Kaiser on 1 April and published on 9 April 2021, in print on 10 April 2021 9 April 2021  Ms Schnabel, the global economy is only slowly recovering from one of the most severe economic crises in living memory, but the mood on stock markets is better than ever. Do you find that a cause for concern?  We are closely monitoring this. Developments in Europe have not been extreme up to now, but there are signs of excesses here too, for example in the real estate market. In the United States, the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio is now higher than it was before the financial crisis of 2008.   Have equity and real estate prices reached such heights again that they are bound to implode at some point?   High share valuations in the euro area are still justified by higher earnings expectations. But the risks of a correction are increasing, especially if the economic recovery falls short of expectations.  The collapse of the US hedge fund Archegos has just generated multi-billion losses for large banks such as Credit Suisse and Nomura. How can a single fund rock such financial giants?   That is indeed a remarkable incident. It shows that there are considerable gaps in the regulation of funds. Archegos is a family office, which manages the capital of a single person. No other investors held any equity, which is why the requirements and reporting obligations were less stringent. The fund was thus able to increase its leverage substantially without it being noticed.   But it’s even more astounding that tightly regulated banks could assume so much risk. Credit Suisse has burnt through a whole year of profits, only at the last minute did Deutsche Bank manage to sell equity stakes that Archegos had posted as collateral for loans – although it actually doesn’t want to conduct such transactions with hedge funds any longer.   There is a need to scrutinise the reasons why the banks enabled the fund to leverage up to such an extent. That could have resulted in further contagion effects.   The institutions thought that their loans were collateralised by the equity stakes held by Archegos. But as the fund was forced to sell these stakes quickly and the prices were plummeting, the collateral was no longer worth much.   Such fire sales are dangerous, as we saw during the global financial crisis. We can be glad that the effect has been limited to just a few players. Otherwise, this incident might even have morphed into a systemic crisis.  That sounds as if the financial sector’s avoidance of more serious consequences was more down to luck than good judgement. Is there a lack of regulation?  It is thanks to regulation that the banks have sufficient capital to cushion losses of that nature. But more is to be done when it comes to funds, because their regulation is predominantly geared towards protecting investors. Fortunately, it has only been a single fund up to now. Nonetheless, it is a warning signal that there are considerable systemic risks that need to be better regulated.   One of the oddities on the financial market is the bitcoin hype. The price of the cryptocurrency has multiplied, firms such as Tesla want to accept bitcoins as a means of payment, there is talk of PayPal customers being able to pay with bitcoins. Are you worried about the prospect of a new, hitherto unregulated currency emerging alongside the euro, dollar and the like?   In our view it is wrong to describe bitcoin as a currency, because it does not fulfil the basic properties of money. It is a speculative asset without any recognisable fundamental value and is subject to massive price swings.   Elon Musk would beg to differ.   He is at liberty to do so.  Currencies such as the euro don’t have any intrinsic value either, but are simply based on trust.   The euro is backed by the ECB, which is highly trusted. And it is legal tender. Nobody can refuse to accept euro. Bitcoin is a different matter.   The fact remains that many people evidently trust bitcoin. Could that harm established currencies like the euro?  My concern is more that trust in cryptocurrencies might rapidly evaporate, causing disruption in financial markets. That is a very fragile system.   The ECB is planning to introduce a digital euro itself. Why is that?   Payment systems today are far more digitalised than they used to be. That is why we need to examine what that means for our monetary system. But nothing has been decided yet. A great deal of preparatory work needs to be done to enable the project to be properly set up.   That would mean that the digital euro would only be introduced in four or five years’ time. Is that not too late?   I don’t think so. Nobody can offer a similar degree of security and data protection as the ECB. People find that topic important: as consumers, to whom do we want to disclose our data? They are surely more likely to trust the ECB than Facebook or other private operators.   The ECB has kept its policy rates at zero for years and is purchasing sovereign and corporate bonds for trillions of euro – always with the aim of boosting inflation. Prices are now finally starting to rise. When will the zero rate policy come to an end?   Yes, inflation is increasing. And as we are still far from reaching our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%, a sustainable rise in the direction of 2% would be good news. That would mean that the economy is gaining momentum and aggregate demand is increasing. Unfortunately, that does not quite match the reality.  Why not?  Because prices are now rising on the back of many one-off effects. The oil price collapsed in 2020 and is now – starting from a low level − climbing back up, and the VAT rate in Germany was raised again in January. That has an impact, but only in the short term. Our medium-term projections show that the rate of inflation will ease again in 2022, because aggregate demand will presumably remain weak.   Many people feel that everything is becoming more expensive. Everyday inflation is perceived as being much higher than the rate officially measured.   This is a well-known phenomenon. That people perceive inflation as being too high is something we experienced when the euro was introduced, for example. We need to better explain to the general public what inflation is. It would be good to invest more in financial literacy. This would also facilitate the ECB’s task. And the measurement of inflation only captures an average, it almost never reflects an individual’s pattern of consumption.   People definitely do notice if a beer suddenly costs them €5 instead of €4.  Certainly, yet perceived inflation is heavily influenced by goods that we consume more frequently. Many people forget that electronic products, for instance, have become cheaper or have improved in quality. If prices stay the same, this actually means the product has become cheaper.   Maybe you should modify the basket of goods that you use to measure inflation.  The basket of goods is drawn from real life, encompassing the goods that people actually consume. What’s more, it’s not the ECB that decides on its composition but the European statistical authority, Eurostat. The price index is constantly being improved, and we submit our views to support this process.  In what form?  We’re talking about how to capture house prices in the future, for instance. Rents are included in the index, while the costs of owner-occupied housing have not been included to date.  Back to the global economy. The United States is vaccinating at a rapid pace and investing trillions in stimulus packages. Europe, by contrast, is falling further and further behind.  This is precisely why – besides ramping up vaccinations – it is so important for Europe to give a strong fiscal response, in the form of the EU recovery fund amounting to €750 billion. In this way Europe is demonstrating solidarity with those countries that have been badly affected by the pandemic but that only have limited fiscal space. At the same time, it is important for the European economy as a whole, and hence especially for an exporting nation like Germany.  No money has been disbursed yet.  That should happen pretty soon. In fact, only a small part of the money is intended to boost consumption in the short run; the majority is earmarked for investment with a view to making Europe permanently more competitive, more digital and greener.  In the meantime, EU countries are seeing their debt exploding.  An increase in public debt is inevitable given the unprecedented situation, and it is also sensible so long as the spending sustainably boosts economic growth.  Doesn’t the fund highlight Europe’s weakness? A decision about a lot of money is made quickly, but then nothing more happens.  No, I’m not quite so downbeat. The money needs to be used sensibly, which takes time.  The Americans are simply making out cheques for every citizen. Has such helicopter money ever been considered by the ECB?  The money in the United States comes from the government, not the central bank. There are certainly also programmes in Europe that help citizens quickly and directly, like short-time working arrangements that are financed in part with European funds. These have been implemented and disbursed really quickly.  Yet Europe is falling behind.  Even before the pandemic, Europe was having to deal with structural problems that urgently need to be addressed. What matters in the short term is that we speed up the vaccination rollout, which will give rise to a strong recovery.  Bernd Lucke, founder of the Alternative for Germany party (AfD), has submitted a complaint to the German Constitutional Court and thereby provisionally stopped the German legislation from ratifying the recovery fund.   It is not up to me to comment on the German Constitutional Court. But it would be an economic disaster for Europe if the disbursement of the funds were to be delayed indefinitely. If that were the case, Europe would have to think about alternative solutions, but that could take some time.  Be it in Turkey, Brazil or until recently the United States under Donald Trump – heads of state in more and more countries are attacking the independence of their central banks. Do you fear such things happening in Europe as well?  No, the ECB is one of the most independent central banks in the world and is only bound by its price stability mandate. We are also protected by the fact that we act as a central bank for 19 countries and not just one.  But what about your de facto inability to raise interest rates, as this would cause euro area countries to collapse under the burden of their debt?  The best protection against this is good fiscal policy. By that I mean that states should not save during the pandemic but take on debt and use the money to invest in growth.   Sounds good, but that is not in your hand. That’s decided by governments.  That’s true, but we are bound by our mandate of price stability and are simply not allowed to finance states. And we cannot promise any government that interest rates will remain low forever. But it will be some time before interest rates start rising again significantly, assuming our inflation forecasts are accurate. And even then, sovereign debt as a whole will not become more expensive overnight, only that part that needs to be refinanced. So higher interest rates would only have a gradual impact. What’s more, many countries raised long-term funding at low interest rates. What really matters, though, is that the European economy takes off again, in which case the debt will also be manageable.  The ECB has recently committed itself to climate protection and wants to compel banks to disclose their climate and environmental risks more transparently. Isn’t this exceeding your mandate?  We ourselves don’t pursue climate policy, that’s done by governments. At the same time, climate change is probably the biggest challenge facing humanity. All decision-makers, and that includes the ECB, need to ask themselves what they can contribute within their respective mandates.  And what is your response?  The ECB is obliged to think about its contribution to climate protection for two reasons. First, climate change has a massive impact on the economy, due to natural disasters for instance, and hence also on price stability. If we ignored this, we would not be fulfilling our mandate. And second, the ECB’s mandate requires it to support the EU’s economic policy, in which climate protection plays a leading role.  With that argument you could support any potential political objective.  This is exactly how it is formulated in the EU treaty. But that only applies so long as it does not compromise our primary objective of price stability.  Ms Schnabel, thank you very much for the conversation.    "
2021-03-23,Philip R. Lane,Interview with CNBC,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach on 22 March 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with CNBC   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach on 22 March 2021 23 March 2021   Let me bring you first to the increased asset purchases. Your asset purchases are now at €21 billion, is that a level the market should get used to now?  As you know, the weekly data are always confounded a bit by redemptions and the week-to-week special factors, but it does reflect our commitment to have a substantial increase in the pace of purchasing. I wouldn’t take any one week in isolation, but of course if you average over several weeks you will see the substantial increase in a consistent way.    If you look at the situation in the bond markets, why are you so concerned? Because if you deduct inflation from the nominal rate, real rates are not such a problem?   We have an inflation forecast which remains quite low, so even in 2023 inflation is only at 1.4% in our forecast. In that context, we would like to see fairly low rates remaining. In fact if we do see inflation pick up − and let me emphasise what really matters with respect to inflation is economy-wide, not just the viewpoint of financial traders, but we would need to see it in firms and households as well − so ideally any pick-up in expected inflation, if it adds to inflation momentum we welcome it. You have to compare the nominal yields we see with respect to the inflation forecast we have, which remains at 1.4% two years ahead.   When we talk about inflation the Fed has opted to allow overshooting. Would you follow the Fed in that respect?   That’s an interesting debate and we have our strategy review and we are still in the middle of that. But the deeper point here is that in a world where essentially lots of central banks have a situation where inflation is too low compared to their target, the universal emphasis and our emphasis has to be to make sure that monetary policy support remains in place until inflation is robustly where we want it to be. We’ve already given forward guidance since September 2019, and we want inflation to robustly converge to our targets. That should provide enough guidance that monetary policy support will be in place until we see that robust convergence.    Would you say the outlook for economic growth and also inflation may deteriorate with what we’re seeing with the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the big countries, in France and Germany which went straight into lockdown again?   It’s important to emphasise that when we made our recent forecasts a couple of weeks ago, we did allow for some extension into the second quarter. So the fact we are now seeing decisions to have lockdown measures extended into April is not too surprising. I would share the concern and it’s not about the lockdown measures because those just reflect the underlying contest with the virus itself. Until the virus is more contained, until we have more progress on vaccinations, and until it’s clearer these mutations are not going to have a prolonged impact, it’s clearly a risk factor. As we now go into the second quarter, it’s going to be a long quarter. The concerning news is that the virus case numbers are remaining high and are creeping up. On the other hand, we also see that in the second quarter over these three months in April, May and June there will be a lot of vaccinations taking place, so over the course of those three months it will be a contest between progress and vaccinations and other medical progress versus the near-term challenge of trying to get this virus under control.   At the same time, the bond market is especially already playing recovery very strong for the United States. So, are you concerned that there is not a possibility to actually decouple the bond markets because they kind of have a tendency to move in tandem?   This is essentially very much on our minds. And of course, the historic correlation between international bond yields and euro area bond yields is something we can respond to. So, if you like, the fact that we responded in our March decision by stepping up the pace of purchasing is a reflection that we can decouple, if you like, the trend in the international bond market and the trend in the euro area market. I mean, I don’t say that’s 100% decoupling. It’s also the case, as you know, that the increase in yields in recent times in the euro area has not been up to the same scale as in the United States. And in the end, it’s for us to determine, as we did in the March decision, based on the joint assessment of what's going on in terms of financing conditions, and also what we see in terms of the inflation outlook – that will determine how much we react in terms of the scale of asset purchasing.   Your Dutch colleague stepped out saying that the scaling-up of the purchases should only be for a certain time until we see a substantial calming-down, perhaps, in the market reaction. Would you agree?   I think behind that comment, underlying that comment, and I think our shared view, is essentially it depends on the pandemic. I mean, of course, the programme, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), is centred on the pandemic emergency. And as we've been discussing, right now there’s a lot of uncertainty about the coming weeks. But as I've also emphasised, we also think there’s going to be a lot of vaccinations in these in these weeks and months. And, you know, we’ve tried to add, to recognise, that the uncertainty is a dominant feature. And no matter how the pandemic plays out, whether it plays out with some disappointment, or whether there’s some acceleration of good news, the PEPP is designed to be flexible, and to respond. So, you know, when Klaas was speaking, he provided a conjecture about one pathway. But the more overriding theme, I think, is with uncertainty about the pandemic, the PEPP will adjust in a flexible way to make sure that financing conditions remain favourable and, in particular, that they've remained supportive of countering the pandemic shock to inflation.   That brings me directly to the question of favourable financing conditions, because clearly there’s a lot of, you know, interpretation of what that really means and which parameters you’re looking at. Perhaps you could try to explain it a bit more to the markets.   The European economy has a mixed financial system. We know for firms and households, it’s bank-based. But of course, market-based funding is also very important for large corporates, for sovereigns. And so this is why we do take a broad approach where we want to look at what’s going on in terms of market conditions. But also, what we see in terms of the funding conditions facing the customers of banks. What we did also emphasise in the March meeting was the special status or role, if you like, for the risk-free curve, and the sovereign yields as well, because they’ve played such an important role in the overall financing conditions of the euro area. And also, it’s obvious when we think about our asset purchasing, that’s where we operate on, we operate on the risk-free curve and the sovereign yields. And that’s why we pay particular attention when we see a significant movement in these yields, as we did over recent weeks.  I had the feeling that during the last meeting, the outlook for the economy was less negative than previously, would you stick to that assessment, also given the situation surrounding the virus now?   So I think we made two statements about that. One is that in the near term, this downside risk was prominent. So the downside risk about whether the pandemic would quickly be controlled remains the dominant issue in the near term. But we also said that the overall balance of risk was becoming more balanced because compared to December, we have the avoidance of a more difficult Brexit outcome. We’ve had the stimulus, fiscal stimulus coming from the United States, we’ve had better data in relation to the end of 2020 in quarter three and quarter four. So we’ve had several pieces of news that would have, if you like, renewed confidence in the medium-term outlook. But at the same time, as we’ve been talking about, we do have this near-term uncertainty, this near-term concern about the pathway for the virus.   Yes that’s clearly the case, but the response from the United States or from the European Union, if you compare that to the United States, we are lagging far behind, are you concerned that the United States will come out of that crisis with a big bang because of their fiscal stimulus. And Europe has to again, like after the last crisis, face many years until we actually recover?   So let me break that into two different questions. One is there will be positive spillovers from the United States. The fact that there is a significant stimulus in the United States will boost global GDP, will boost exports from the euro area. Of course, the initial impact was visible more in the financial markets. But over time, as the stimulus gets rolled out, it will be a significant engine for the world economy. I would emphasise, of course, given the nature of the United States, that you can have very large fiscal packages embodied in a single piece of legislation. As you know, in the European situation, we have a mix. We have 19 national fiscal policies, and then we have the joint fiscal action. So maybe it's worth keeping in mind the statement from the Eurogroup from a couple of weeks ago, which heavily emphasised that the Eurogroup collectively are paying close attention, and essentially committing that there will be an agile fiscal response in recognition that as this pandemic unfolds, it is very important that fiscal support is maintained, and that there is no early exit. So I think, then maybe you see every week or every few days, a fiscal announcement coming from individual member countries. So I do think the forward guidance is there, from the Eurogroup, that the scale of fiscal policy will respond to the unfolding of the pandemic. But I do think it's for all of us to reflect; the parameters of the fiscal debate have clearly moved with the US decision. And it is an important issue for European policymakers to reflect upon about how to calibrate the European fiscal response, and to make sure it's sufficient to get through this pandemic.   So in other words, the longer the pandemic lasts, the higher the pressure also on Brussels to think about increasing the package?   Well, I think again, there's a range of possibilities. And, of course, we also have to do the basics of making sure that the recovery plans are finalised; that’s been a heavy focus of work in recent times. So again, the combination of national fiscal policy and EU level really has to be set so that as the pandemic unfolds, fiscal policy is agile. And I think that is the commitment of the Eurogroup.   The fiscal response clearly is a huge step for the European Union with these Next Generation EU bonds. And this would probably also mean that we are going to have a proper European yield curve at one point in time. Is that something which makes monetary policy easier?   Of course, the significant bond issuance that's envisaged on the Next Generation EU, and the fact that it's going to have a whole range of maturities will be helpful in deepening the stock of safe assets in the euro area. It will be an important reference point. But I would try to avoid arguing that there needs to be one single reference point in thinking about the pricing of European assets. So I think the nature of Europe is it's always going be a mix of EU level and national level fiscal policy, and how we think about the stock of safe assets, how we think about reference points, I think will reflect that. As we've talked about earlier on, you know, we essentially are jointly looking at the risk-free curve, where we often use the overnight index swap curve as a kind of useful proxy for that. But we also look at the whole constellation of sovereign yields. Now, when we have more EU issuance, we already have the SURE bonds. I think it's super informative and super helpful to have that. But I think the overall message is, the stock of safe assets in Europe is going up, not just because of the EU level issuance, but because of the decline in risk premia for many sovereigns in the euro area.

I’m looking forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Join the conversation! #AskECB   #AskECB  Why dont you better explain your policies by indicating the aimed positive consequences, but also the potential negatives.   @FrankElderson: While the evidence is that our policies are very effective we certainly also have possible side effects on our radar. The two-tier system is a case in point where we have reacted to mitigate the potential side effects of our negative rate policy on banks #AskECB   #AskECB How will the ECB evaluate and quantify the climate risk associated with its investment portfolio on an annual basis?   @FrankElderson: The Eurosystem is preparing the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions and other sustainable and responsible investment-related metrics of these Eurosystem portfolios, including the use of some specialised data provider  Are we entering an inflationary or deflationary period in the Eurozone?   @FrankElderson: Inflation increased sharply in January and February and is likely to go up further in the coming months. This is mainly due to transitory factors, which we look through. Underlying inflation remains subdued owing to weak demand and economic slack #AskECB   #AskECB  Dear Frank Is the massive stimulus from ECB leading to zombification of EU economy as firms may get inefficient and workers might lose skills for productivity   @FrankElderson: We don’t see that. The pandemic is deep but temporary, so the risk of zombification is less pronounced than in other downturns. In general, the share of zombie companies in the euro area has declined since 2014 #AskECB   What are you proud of?   @FrankElderson: Personally, I am very proud of my wife and our two great daughters! Professionally, I am honoured to work for Europe and committed to helping make the lives of Europeans better in this pandemic #AskECB   Will would a rate rise be expected?   @FrankElderson: Our forward guidance is clear on that: We expect interest rates to stay at their present level or lower until we see that inflation comes back to our objective of close to, but below, 2 per cent #AskECB   Assuming the ECB wants to maintain favourable financial conditions while inflation expectations improve, does this imply a reference point for real yields, e.g. as observed in early December 2020?    @FrankElderson: We look at a number of indicators. To determine whether financing conditions are favourable, we look at their underlying drivers and how they develop over time, in combination with the inflation outlook #AskECB   #AskECB  What is your stance on crypto? If positive, when crypto EUR?   @FrankElderson: Crypto-assets are volatile. They lack any intrinsic value and there is no reliable institution backing them. In contrast, a digital euro would offer Europeans the same level of confidence as with cash, since it would be backed by the ECB #AskECB   @FrankElderson   #AskECB   At the last press conference Mme Lagarde said there will be a 'staged' approached where information, disclosure and investment will all be required to address the climate question. What does this mean? The slower the ECB acts the more problematic it will be   @FrankElderson: Better disclosure and transparency on environmental risks has top priority over everything else so that consumers, investors, businesses and policymakers can take informed decisions for a more sustainable future #AskECB   #AskECB  Are structural forces still keeping inflation down or could Covid-19 be a structural break in that regard?   @FrankElderson: It is true that pandemic-related supply constraints, among other factors, are expected to increase inflation during this year. However, our assessment is that underlying price pressures will remain muted due to weak demand and low wage pressures #AskECB   #AskECB What is your plan against the inequality because of the flood of money? Costs for living are skyrocketing, assets go crazy. While the rich had the year of their live millions lost their jobs and starving.  @FrankElderson: Asset purchases can lead to higher asset prices but they’ve also helped to maintain millions of jobs. We're closely monitoring side effects of our measures and analyses have shown consistently that positive effects have exceeded negative ones #AskECB   #AskECB  What is meant by “upstream and downstream” regarding the statements on March 11th press release about indicators, the upstream and downstream indicators, could you please help further my understanding on this terminology?   @FrankElderson: Upstream: important benchmark rates that mark the starting point of our monetary policy transmission. Downstream: the financing conditions that are more relevant for households and firms but are only affected by our policy with a delay #AskECB   What’s worth more, those tulips or one Bitcoin?  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: Tulips are beautiful flowers. For those who remember 17th century Tulip Mania, they also serve as a reminder of what can happen when prices don’t reflect intrinsic value #AskECB   #AskECB  Is the ECB considering an assessment of the negative impact its CPPS might be having on the EU Environmental Policy, in terms of hindering/delaying the achievement of objectives & waste of resources due to lack of policy coherence between ECB´s action and COM&MS´s action?   @FrankElderson: Climate is a topic dear to my heart. We need urgent action and we are committed to doing our part within our mandate. How to incorporate climate change in our tasks is a key part of our #strategyreview, reviewing also our concept of market neutrality #AskECB   #AskECB : why did the ECB pre-commit to a significantly higher PEPP pace throughout Q2 - regardless of the state of financial conditions - thereby reducing the programs most lauded feature, its flexibility? And why did it take another decision to honor the Dec commitment?    @FrankElderson: The increase is precisely a reflection of the flexibility embedded in the PEPP. We have increased purchases to prevent a tightening of financing conditions, that would risk the return of inflation to pre-pandemic levels #AskECB   @FrankElderson What is  @ecb  status with  #CBDC  development  #AskECB #Algorand   @FrankElderson: We will make the decision whether to launch the investigation phase for a #digitaleuro towards the middle of 2021 #AskECB   Why is the DAX doing all time highs again even with companies struggling more than ever?   @FrankElderson: Companies indeed face severe challenges due to the ongoing pandemic.

However, it is up to governments to make such policies #AskECB   #AskECB  Hello Frank, do you think that central banks should ensure that the stock of assets they hold for monetary policy purposes are in line with a net zero emissions target?   @FrankElderson: The Treaties require us to support the EU’s environmental objectives and policies when pursuing our mandate. But our actions must not prejudice our objective of price stability #AskECB   Any efforts to make the ECB board more diverse? Not only in terms of gender, but for instance: some countries require central banks to have trade union representatives on its board and/or forbid financial sector representatives.  #AskECB   @FrankElderson: We value all facets of diversity, incl. gender, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, cultural background and disability. Governments appoint the Executive Board. As supervisors, we push banks towards more diverse boards and staff #AskECB   #AskECB  I hope someone will ask the question of why the ECB is keeping so much dry powder when the indie tightening is an issue for the Eurozone   @FrankElderson: We use as much powder as needed to preserve favourable financing conditions. Based on an assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, we expect PEPP purchases over the next quarter to be done at a significantly higher pace than before #AskECB  Time to wrap up.

2021-03-17,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Les Echos ,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Guillaume Benoit, Elsa Conesa, Lucie Robequain and Sophie Rolland ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Les Echos    Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Guillaume Benoit, Elsa Conesa, Lucie Robequain and Sophie Rolland  16 March 2021  There has been a delay in the supply of vaccines in Europe. To what extent does that jeopardise the EU’s recovery?   The recovery crucially depends on the pace of vaccinations. The vaccination campaign got off to a slow start, but it has accelerated in most Member States. Our projections for the short term show a deterioration due to the resurgence of the virus and the new containment measures imposed in several countries. But the good news is that in the last quarter of 2020, the lockdowns caused less damage than during the first wave of the pandemic. The economy seems to be adapting better to the situation. The economic recovery will be further supported by the new US stimulus package, the effects of which have not yet been included in our staff projections. We also expect additional fiscal stimulus measures in Europe, which will amplify the effects of our monetary policy. All of this leads us to expect a firm rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year once the containment measures are lifted. According to our staff projections, the euro area economy is expected to grow by 4% this year. Real GDP should return to its pre-crisis level in the second quarter of 2022. But the economic impact of the pandemic will certainly be felt well beyond the duration of the health crisis. The economy will not be the same after the pandemic. This requires structural change, which is never easy. Some jobs will disappear, while new ones will develop. This process will take time.  Can we expect a uniform recovery across the eurozone?   Since the very beginning of the crisis, there was a fear that divergences would appear across countries in the euro area. The services sector has been much more affected by the containment measures than manufacturing. A K-shaped recovery has emerged. Some countries will suffer more severely than others, notably because of their reliance on tourism.   The United States has just approved a stimulus package worth $1.9 trillion. Should Europe go further than the €750 billion announced under the Next Generation EU plan?   The comparison is not straightforward because part of the measures announced by the US Administration act as automatic stabilisers, which are already part of social security systems in Europe. So the difference is less significant than it may appear. Nonetheless, the US measures are bigger. It may be that the European support will turn out to be insufficient. But I think that the discussion is premature. What matters now is that the agreed European funds are disbursed as quickly as possible. That’s absolutely fundamental. We cannot afford a delay, this would be detrimental. The earlier the funds are made available, the better. Even more importantly, we need to make sure that countries spend the funds wisely, in order to foster their growth potential.  The United Kingdom has announced tax increases in order to pay back the COVID-19-related debt. Do you think the countries in the eurozone should do the same?   Raising taxes in the middle of the pandemic would not be a good idea. The priority is to generate growth. Once the recovery has set in there will be a need to reflect on the best ways of bringing public finances back onto solid ground. But the biggest risk at the moment is to withdraw fiscal support too early. This is a mistake that was made in the past and that we must avoid this time.  Why didn’t the European Central Bank step up its asset purchases when there was a particularly pronounced rise in rates?   In December we decided to preserve favourable financing conditions for firms and households for as long as necessary in order to counter the pandemic shock to the projected path of inflation. This does not mean that we target a specific yield level. We assess the evolution of financing conditions in the context of the overall economic development in the euro area. To do so we need to look at what factors are driving the rate increase: expectations of a stronger economic recovery boosted by an accelerating pace of vaccinations, rising commodity prices, or the US fiscal stimulus programme? Overall, recent changes in risk-free rates have been consistent with an improving growth outlook. Rising inflation expectations have been a key factor driving yields higher, signalling that the policy measures in place are bearing fruit. Despite the recent uptick in yields, financing conditions remain close to historically accommodative levels. But the speed of adjustment was a source of concern. It risked a premature and too abrupt withdrawal of policy support, which could have choked the incipient recovery. That is why we have announced a significant increase in our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in the second quarter. We will tolerate higher interest rates only if they do not risk slowing the recovery.   In the short term, even if the rates increase, they would remain extremely low. Is there really a risk that they may slow down the recovery?  Again, what concerns us is not so much the level of interest rates – which are still very close to their historic lows – but rather the rapid change. If we see that the market may get ahead of itself in an environment of still high uncertainty and weak demand, it is important to protect our policy stimulus. But it would be wrong to think of us as having defined a threshold above which we have to respond. That is not the case.  Do you think the eurozone should have a permanent borrowing facility?  From a macroeconomic perspective it would be an important complement to our single monetary policy. But this is a political decision that also raises governance issues. Clearly, the Next Generation EU recovery programme is a crucial element of Europe’s response to the pandemic, which mitigates the risk of economic divergence between countries that have been affected very differently by the crisis. It is a crucial step in the history of the euro area. Whether this temporary instrument could pave the way for a permanent borrowing facility will largely depend on how it is used. If the funds that are deployed enable Member States to embark on a sustainable growth trajectory, this will foster trust and hence increase the chances of fiscal integration in the euro area being strengthened in the future.  Several members of the Governing Council expressed differing opinions before your last meeting. Was it particularly difficult to reach a consensus?  There was full consensus about the decision to step up the pace of purchases. Everyone was aware that we needed to act, and nobody opposed this. Of course, there are always slightly different views on how to judge the economic situation or the recent interest rate developments. But in the end, we came to a common understanding of what needed to be done. The Governing Council consists of 25 members with diverse views. That is a strength.  Everyone is wondering about the new purchase amounts that will be deployed within the framework of the PEPP…  We decided not to pre-announce any amounts because flexibility remains one of the most important features of the PEPP. That means that we can adjust our asset purchases according to market conditions. We purchase more when necessary, and we can reduce our purchases when markets are calm.  Aren’t you worried the market will test precisely that flexibility?  No, I think the past months have shown that markets are behaving in an orderly fashion. Clearly, we were sufficiently credible such that market participants knew we would react if needed. That’s what we have done. I think markets will learn quickly how we implement our December decision.  Is the ECB concerned about the level of asset valuations in the markets?  We are monitoring financial markets closely but, so far, the situation of European stock markets is not a reason for concern. Valuations in the US stock market are more stretched, however. In the euro area they are more in line with their historical distribution but also here we are seeing valuations moving consistently higher.  The ECB has created an ideal environment for Member States to deploy fiscal policies. Debts have massively increased. Aren’t its hands tied? Isn’t the ECB at risk of losing its independence?  I don’t agree that our hands are tied. The euro area is built on the fundamental principle of monetary dominance – our actions are guided by our mandate, as it is defined by the Treaty. This principle is supported on the one hand by our independence, and on the other hand by the EU’s fiscal framework, which is designed to ensure that governments pursue sound fiscal policies. Our monetary policy is always guided by our price stability mandate, so I don’t see a threat of fiscal dominance. Currently, fiscal policy is key to stabilising the economy. And if the funds are used wisely to boost potential growth, that’s also good for monetary policy, as it would increase our room for manoeuvre in the future. It would also enable countries to stabilise their debt-to-GDP ratios. So it would be a big mistake to reduce fiscal spending prematurely for fear of fiscal dominance.  Have the banks done everything they could to support the economy?  Banks played a crucial role in supporting the economy at the height of the pandemic. They allowed firms to draw down their credit lines and there was a sharp increase in bank lending to firms. Since then, lending activity has moderated. This is linked to the fact that firms still have fairly high liquidity buffers because part of the loans they have taken out have not been used so far. They appear to be hesitant to invest in the current uncertain economic environment. Our bank lending survey indicates that the banks have recently tightened their credit conditions. So far this is not visible in the rates they charge, which remain at historically low levels, but rather in non-price components, such as the required collateral. As public guarantees are gradually being phased out, banks are concerned about rising credit risk. Our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) set incentives for banks to continue lending, even in an environment with higher corporate vulnerabilities. This has worked very well in the past, and we are confident that it will also work in the future.  After the ECB’s “classic” public sector purchase programme was challenged before the German constitutional court, it’s now the turn of the PEPP. Do you think it will be called into question?  That could happen. However, it is clear that it is the Court of Justice of the European Union that has jurisdiction over the ECB, and not the German constitutional court. But of course, we take these issues very seriously. We adhere strictly to the limits of our mandate, and the proportionality of our measures is fundamental for our decisions. I am convinced that our new asset purchase programme – the PEPP – will also be considered to comply with the European Treaty, because it was designed as an emergency measure in an extreme situation. This is the worst economic crisis we have experienced since the Second World War. In an exceptional situation, policymakers must take exceptional measures. This was done both on the fiscal side and on the monetary policy side. Our actions were proportionate to the situation we were facing.  As you said, the PEPP is an exceptional programme put in place to respond to an emergency. On what basis will you decide when it’s time to end it?   The PEPP is clearly linked to the pandemic crisis, so it is a temporary programme. When we judge the pandemic crisis phase to be over, and when we have managed to counter the shock to the inflation path, it will be time to end it. But let me emphasise that the economic effects of the crisis will likely be more persistent. Our other instruments will remain available to ensure that inflation converges back to our medium-term aim.   The crisis has resulted in Member States taking on a lot more debt. How will they be able to reduce it? Thanks to inflation? Could a partial debt cancellation be envisaged?   The most important factor is economic growth. At some point, fiscal consolidation will also need to be considered. But it must not happen too early and it has to be implemented in a growth-friendly way; that’s very important. As for the debate on debt cancellation, which I know is quite active in France, such a measure would clearly be in breach of the Treaty as it would constitute monetary financing. But the question goes beyond a legal argument. Economically speaking, it does not make sense. The whole idea is based on an accounting illusion. Moreover, cancelling the debt would call into question the ECB’s commitment to its price stability mandate. It would undermine the rule of law and could jeopardise the ECB’s independence. That opinion is widely shared, including by French economists.  There are growing calls for the ECB to take a more active role in combatting climate change, like the Bank of England, which has announced that it will stop buying bonds from big polluters. How can the ECB contribute?  This is a topic we are discussing intensively as part of our strategic review. Obviously, it’s governments that are mainly responsible for climate policy. We cannot pursue climate policies ourselves, because that’s not part of our mandate. But given the urgency of the matter and the partial irreversibility of climate change, all policymakers – and that includes central bankers – must ask themselves how they can contribute. But we must stay strictly within our mandate. We do have some room for manoeuvre, however. It can even be argued that the Treaty requires us to take climate change into account. In any case, we have to take physical climate-change risk, and transition risks stemming from climate policies, into account in our economic models. Those risks must also be monitored in the context of banking supervision. And if climate change poses risks to our balance sheet, we will need to adapt our monetary policy operations. One of the points being debated more fiercely is whether our private asset purchase programmes unduly favour carbon-intensive firms. In fact, this is partly true, simply because those are the firms that tend to issue bonds. This situation necessitates an in-depth discussion on whether the existing interpretation of what we call the principle of market neutrality is the right one.   Is the sharp increase in corporate debt brought on by the pandemic a cause for concern?  Many firms had to take out loans to bridge the time of the lockdowns. It is likely that some of these firms will not be able to survive, because certain businesses will not be viable after the pandemic. Some corporate restructuring will probably be inevitable. This will also lead to an increase in non-performing loans for banks, along with potential losses on loans backed by government guarantees. More generally, a debt overhang in the corporate sector could reduce firms’ incentives to invest. It would be preferable to offer equity-type support to firms, as this does not create the same problems. The main challenge will be to manage the transition from a situation in which firms are protected by public guarantees and in which there are almost no insolvencies to a situation of normality, in which firms must once again operate without state support.   What could be a good indicator of financing conditions in the eurozone?  That’s the million-euro question! The truth is that there is no single indicator or simple formula for assessing favourable financing conditions in the euro area. What we must do is examine a broad dashboard of indicators among which sovereign yields and risk-free rates play a prominent role, as President Lagarde explained last week. We must then interpret changes in those indicators in the light of the economic environment. An increase in interest rates, for example, could be a result of an upward shift in inflation expectations. This would be a sign that our measures are working. That’s why we need to understand what is behind the changes measured by our indicators.   "
2021-03-16,Philip R. Lane,Interview with the Financial Times,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold","   INTERVIEW  Interview with the Financial Times   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold 16 March 2021  What impact has the pandemic had on the eurozone?   A pandemic recession is unique because a lot of the decline in output results from public health measures. When these measures are lifted and the virus is contained, you should expect to see a very large recovery. We saw glimpses of that last year, especially in the third quarter. As the economy was unlocked and while infection rates were at a relatively low level, there was a strong recovery above what we had predicted.  Once we get better control of the virus we should expect to see most of the economy just go back to normal. There can be exceptions, though, such as the question of office work versus working from home. We all talk about a new normal, which will be somewhere in between. I think it is definitely not going to be fully back to the office, but, at the same time, the value of office life will probably be more appreciated now than it was a few months ago. That has both positive and negative implications for the economy: negative, maybe, for certain types of commercial real estate; and positive perhaps in terms of digitalisation.  Another sector that will probably take time to recover is international travel. By this I mean the airline industry and the hotel industry, whether business travel or tourism, which have taken a big hit. Those firms that have not been earning usual levels of revenue will have weaker balance sheets coming out of this and we know a big factor in investment is the strength of the balance sheets of firms. It will probably take time for those sectors to go fully back to normal in terms of their financial capacity.  Coming back to the narrative of inflation in the euro area and to the 2015 to 2017 period, when the recovery of inflation and the economy was quite muted, it was due to a combination of the time it takes to recover from a financial crisis on one side and the prioritisation of fiscal consolidation on the other. This time, however, there is definitely an intention to secure the recovery — in the European context it is built into the EU recovery fund with a five-year horizon. It is not just about getting through the pandemic. In this context, you might be more optimistic about inflation dynamics, even if the pandemic itself is definitely a severe negative.   What percentage of output could be permanently lost after we come out of the pandemic?   Our staff projections published last week foresee that euro area GDP will have recovered to 2019 levels by mid-2022. This goes back to the unique nature of the pandemic. It is not like the global financial crisis, where there were many years of lost output. The whole logic of the very extensive fiscal and monetary accommodation is that you don’t want to amplify the significant temporary losses in the pandemic by being too reluctant to provide policy support. And again, you can be quite extensive in policy support because it’s only for a relatively short period of time. Then, with enough policy support the damage to the economy should be as little as possible. I am not putting the long-term damage to zero, but it is relatively contained.   With the Biden administration planning a $1.9 trillion relief plan in the United States, does Europe’s economy risk falling further behind the United States and other big trading partners?   There are different ways to do it, but the numbers show that, between automatic stabilisers and special measures, the United States offered fiscal support in 2020 of around 10 per cent of GDP and the euro area of around 7 per cent. You could spend time comparing these, but in each case this was a big effort and there was a lot of support provided.  Now, the United States is bridging the pandemic and going into the recovery phase. In Europe, too, a bit later but not that far away this year, we think it is going to be the same kind of transition from dealing with the pandemic to securing the recovery. If you use the European Commission numbers and compare what they were saying in the autumn to what they said in the spring forecasts, Europe has also been moving in the same direction in terms of having more extensive fiscal support.  That said, it is relevant that the euro area has 20 fiscal policies, the 19 national ones and the common fiscal element. In the United States, the fiscal union makes a dramatic difference, there is so much risk-sharing embedded in a fiscal union of the scale of the United States. A combination of greater macroeconomic coordination of national fiscal policies and more joint fiscal action would be effective in unlocking more fiscal capacity in Europe. As you know, across Europe a lot of the fiscal support for firms is now turning from guaranteed loans towards more kinds of equity-type support or transfers. So I wouldn’t be fatalistic about it. There is a policy decision about protecting the financial health of the European economy through wage subsidies, loan guarantees and other forms of supports for workers and firms. Of course, it is not easy, because you always have to differentiate and be selective. You cannot have an unconditional approach. Clearly you had firms that were in good shape before the pandemic and, with the randomness of who gets hit by the pandemic, you might argue there is a public policy case to make sure that a very high proportion of those firms can get through this.  Then there is the EU recovery plan, which has two important attributes. It is a five-year programme — so it is not just for the pandemic but also to secure the recovery. And it is joint funding. You have a unique initiative in Europe now, which we may all have normalised, but if you go back to the debate last May it is really quite something.   Let’s switch to monetary policy, an area over which you have more control. The ECB’s 2023 eurozone inflation forecast of 1.4 per cent is still below your target of just under 2 per cent. Doesn’t that imply that you need to do much more than you are doing?   We have an ongoing two-stage challenge – counter the negative pandemic shock to the inflation path and subsequently finish the task of raising inflation to our aim. We are doing quite a bit — we have a policy rate of minus 0.5 per cent when most major central banks are hovering around zero. Even before the pandemic we had a significant quantitative easing programme and we had already accumulated nearly 30 per cent of the European sovereign bond market.  We always say, and our internal feasibility calculations show, we could do more in terms of providing additional stimulus. What is most important is converging to the target in good time, with the speed of convergence ensuring that inflation expectations do not drift further away from the target. While we don’t think we are at the lower bound, there is clearly less room to deliver monetary stimulus when interest rates are already low, compared to historical norms. Under these circumstances, it is important to take decisive action to keep up the inflation momentum, while recognising that patience is required. By and large, I don’t see any policy statement from any major central bank anywhere in the world saying they are going to deliver sustainable inflation at 2 per cent super-quickly — it is an uphill climb.  The ECB has switched in the past few months to a focus on maintaining “favourable financing conditions”. Does that indicate that you don’t think the cost-benefit analysis of trying to lower rates further is worth it?   No, I don’t think so. Let me try to rephrase it. Everyone would agree that by our December meeting what we had was a pretty flat yield curve compared to our deposit rate. If you look at the risk-free rates going out ten years, that curve had never been so flat. What is true is that we could lower the deposit rate. In that sense, we don’t think we are at the lower bound. To me it is an efficiency issue: rather than focus on pushing down the curve compared to the mid-December level, monetary accommodation could be better provided by preserving favourable financial conditions, especially in responding to a tightening that would be inconsistent with offsetting the pandemic shock to the inflation path.  That is already happening.   Yes, and our objective is basically to make sure that yield curves – which play an important role in determining overall financing conditions - do not move ahead of the economy. Because, as you know, financial markets are very forward-looking and you can have a steepening in yield curves which is not conducive to maintaining progress in terms of the inflation dynamic. It is really a shift in monetary policy away from focusing on just the short-term rate by looking at all financing conditions. For many economic decisions, especially under the conditions we have now, the longer end also matters.  I should say that our favourability assessment of financing conditions is dynamic. It does depend on how much progress we are making in terms of the inflation forecast. It is not yield curve control in the sense of saying we want to keep the yield curve at some fixed value; because over time the relation between the appropriate level of yields and inflation will move.  We have quite volatile inflation during the pandemic but we look past most of that. If you are the type of firm, or household, or government that needs to rely on medium to long-term financing, you should be reassured by this forward guidance on maintaining favourable financing conditions.   Wouldn’t it be more reassuring if you did as the Japanese and Australian central banks have done and commit to keeping yields at a specific level?   By and large, with the exception of Japan, the yield curve control debate globally is focused on the two to three-year horizon — the Reserve Bank of Australia has a three-year horizon. The ongoing question that is always worth considering is whether it is enough to have forward guidance on our policy rates. Markets and survey participants don’t think we are going to raise rates in the next two to three years. So in that sense we have secured that two to three-year part of the yield curve through forward guidance.  Japan is a special case as the Bank of Japan offers a fixed value for the ten-year yield. You might say that, in a highly dynamic context, where you know there is going to be a recovery — and with the pandemic you are much more certain there is going to be a recovery than after a financial crisis — committing to a fixed value seems unnecessary.   Why is it unnecessary?   Because we are not in such a knife-edge situation that it makes sense to keep the 10-year yield at a permanently fixed value. The important point here is that we provide enough monetary accommodation to make sure that financing conditions are favourable so that the pandemic shock to inflation is offset and we deliver a path to convergence with the inflation target.   Another debate at the ECB as part of your strategy review is whether you should follow the US Federal Reserve and commit to allowing inflation to overshoot your target to make up for a period of undershooting. The early signs are that you will not go that far and opt for a more symmetric inflation target instead. Is that right?   We are right in the middle of the strategy review and everything is still under analysis. The interesting question is if there is a strategic commitment that following a period of undershooting you signal that the correction phase is not just going to the target but going moderately above the target for a period. I think there is a very strong logic to that.  There are some open questions too. One is that the ECB has always had a medium-term orientation and there have been plenty of overshooting periods in the past, when the ECB has been above 2 per cent. So I don’t think that 2 per cent has necessarily been seen as a ceiling.  It is also true that there are communication issues here. Now, these are not necessarily insoluble communication issues. But as you know, across Europe there are very different histories of inflation and the history of inflation in some European countries is very different to the American experience.   Are you going back to hyperinflation in the 1920s?   Sure. We are very scholarly people here. We look at how different kinds of outcomes create very persistent memories in populations, not just from the recent past.  No one would go for a strict version of averaging where a period of inflation above target inflation would require engineering a subsequent period of below-target inflation to hit the average. But the history of inflation matters. You need ways to demonstrate that people should believe that you will deliver your target over the medium term. It’s too early in our process to say there is only one way to ensure that inflation expectations are where we want them to be. There is a very strong analytical case for flexible average inflation targeting, but there are other options that may also be successful in anchoring inflation expectations.   Let’s talk about fragmentation. Is it a concern that we could have a two-speed recovery in the eurozone, with growth and inflation surging in some countries while others lag behind? How do you set monetary policy for the whole bloc in those conditions?   We look at the aggregate data. There is no other way to do monetary policy. But what is true is that in addition to the single monetary policy, other measures are needed. We are consistent in emphasising that for those countries where monetary policy is looser than the national economy would need, macroprudential policy or fiscal policy should be set differently. You can’t just have one policy lever, and I think we learnt that in the previous crisis years to great regret.  What is amazing about last year is that we had that divergence, we had a big surge in public debt and yet risk premia came down. To me, a very important element of that -- coming back to the EU recovery fund -- is that the global investor community could draw its conclusions from the fact that when there was a large common shock, Europe was able to respond in a way that made sure there was that joint support. That is a very fundamental revision of global beliefs about the durability and resilience of the euro area.   "
2021-03-02,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Público,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank (ECB), conducted by Sérgio Aníbal","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Público   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank (ECB), conducted by Sérgio Aníbal 2 March 2021  The euro area economy once again stumbled at the start of 2021. Are you confident that the recovery will be consistent from now on?  The key will be the way in which the vaccination process is rolled out. If the vaccination programme can start to be accelerated in Europe, as I think is possible, then perhaps in summer we could have the majority of the European population vaccinated. And if you look at the economic indicators in the euro area, there are signs that manufacturing is doing well, while services are lagging behind. So, if vaccination starts to create immunity, the containment measures will start to gradually be lifted, and that will be very good news for the services sector and will help the recovery. While we are still finalising our March projections, growth in the first quarter of this year, and perhaps the second, will be relatively weaker than expected, but by the second half of the year, if the vaccination programme goes as we hope, we could see a noticeable rebound in activity.  Will inflation continue to increase, as we saw in January?  We saw a relatively large increase in January, but it was not unexpected because we knew about the base effects in the same period last year that would be reversed, such as the change in the VAT rate in Germany, the drop in fuel prices a year ago, or temporary statistical effects. We would expect to see inflation above 1% on average during the whole of 2021.   There is currently a debate as to whether the current expansionary monetary and fiscal policies will lead to a return of very high inflation rates. Are you concerned about this possibility?  We projected an increase in inflation in 2021. In 2020, inflation was 0.3% and, with the recovery of the economy, we projected in December that inflation would be 1% on average. In terms of this debate surrounding inflation, we need to take into account that there are forces at odds with each other. On the one hand, we have the pandemic’s impact on the output gap, which shows that there is currently a lack of demand. On the other hand, there is a great deal of monetary and fiscal stimuli, plus an increase in commodity prices and the recovery in world demand. All in all, I would say that we do not need to be very concerned about inflation in the short term, and in the medium term we will continue to look at it very carefully, as we always do. There are structural factors that could push inflation up all over the world, for instance supply chains are going to be more regional than before and globalisation is not going to be as rapid as it was in the last ten years. But in the short term, in the next 12 months, inflation will remain below our aim on average.  So, will the plans that the ECB had for the next few months remain unchanged? Does the recent rise in yields change anything?  At the moment, our priority is to maintain favourable financing conditions. We have recently seen an increase in yields, which is partly due to the expectation of higher inflation in the United States because of President Biden’s programme, as well as the increase in commodity prices and the recovery in global demand. We will have to see whether this increase in nominal yields will have a negative impact on financing conditions. If we reach the conclusion that it will, then we are totally open to recalibrating our programme including the envelope of our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) if necessary. We have room for manoeuvre, and we have ammunition. But there is some good news. Despite the fact that yields have increased, we have not seen an increase in spreads which is a sign that, in terms of avoiding fragmentation, our programme is working. Yields are going up, but this is the case in both core and peripheral countries. This will be the key factor over the coming weeks and months for our monetary policy, i.e. understanding whether this increase in yields is due to trends in inflation or whether there are other factors that could hinder economic recovery. And that is something that we will have to examine, but one thing is clear: we have the flexibility that is needed in order to react.  In the context of the current crisis, the countries hit hardest are those that depend more on tourism but have less fiscal space to start with. And those are the countries that experienced problems during the last crisis. Do you see a risk of a divergence between economies, which might trigger some degree of fragmentation in terms of access to financing?  There are certainly significant disparities in terms of the rate at which economies are developing. If we look at larger countries, for example, on the one hand you have Spain which has seen its GDP fall by 11%, whilst on the other hand Germany has seen a drop of just over 5%. This is something which is very obvious and is connected with the structure of the economy, the weight of the services sector, of tourism, or the average size of companies. Another additional element is the fact that the fiscal space available was not the same in every country at the start of the crisis. The main instrument for dealing with that is going to be the NextGenerationEU plan which will focus more on those countries that have suffered most because of the pandemic.  Isn’t it taking too long to implement? We see the United States has plans that it intends to implement very quickly...  What I want to stress is that we would like the plan to be implemented as soon as possible. But there is something that is quite obvious: it is very important that the money is spent on projects that increase medium-term growth, that increase potential growth in economies. This is not only something to subsidise current expenditure. These resources, which are huge, should not only be spent on short-term targets, they should also be used as an instrument to improve the functioning of the economy in the medium term. But yes, the time being taken to implement the plan is a vital question and I hope that by the middle of the year we will start to see the funds flowing to the various countries.  What will the ECB’s asset purchase programmes after the PEPP look like? For instance, will the ECB be able to purchase debt without having to observe a self-imposed limit on the percentage of a country’s debt that it can hold?  The PEPP is a temporary programme tied to the evolution of the pandemic. We will recalibrate the programme depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the impact the pandemic is having on the economy. It is something that will be around until the pandemic and its consequences have come to an end. As regards the future, this is a question that will form part of our strategy review, where we will be examining a range of issues, including the definition of price stability, the way we calibrate side effects in our decision-making process, the consideration of secondary objectives and the instruments that we use. In my opinion - and I would stress that this is my own personal view - the most important part of this strategy review is going to be looking at how we are going to use our instruments. And my own approach is that we should have all the instruments available. We are using instruments classified as non-standard but which are becoming more conventional and will form part of any central bank’s toolkit. But we need to be careful with respect to the side effects they could have, mainly in terms of financial stability.  Several countries, Portugal included, will come out of this crisis with a great deal of debt, much more than before, and much of that debt is owned by the ECB. Is this a cause for concern?  It is true that one of the legacies of the crisis is the fact that the public debt ratio is higher than before the pandemic. But that is a consequence of the current fiscal policy. Governments need to spend money in order to fight the consequences of the pandemic and once the pandemic is over and the economic recovery starts to gain momentum, countries will need to once again work at reducing fiscal imbalances. If we can return to the GDP levels we had before, countries will have to implement sensible fiscal consolidation programmes. But that’s not something to be dealt with right now. It can only take place once the pandemic is over. Now what we need to do is incur fiscal deficits, to spend correctly and once the pandemic is over, we will be able to look at the need for a fiscally responsible response to the current situation.  So, governments in the euro area should not be in a hurry to return to the European fiscal rules that are currently suspended…   I don’t want to interfere in decisions that need to be made by the European Commission and the Council. What I can tell you is that our recommendation is that it is important to withdraw fiscal stimulus very gradually, in keeping with how the pandemic develops, and the evolution of the economy. If we start withdrawing fiscal stimulus too early, we could see a significant deceleration in the recovery. So our recommendation to governments is to be very careful with phasing out, to do so with prudence, and to not react prematurely. If mistakes have to be made, then better to make them by being excessively prudent when withdrawing fiscal stimulus.  Given the huge accumulation of government debt we are currently seeing, a group of economists recently called on the ECB to take steps to cancel some of the debt held by euro area countries. Could the ECB help in this way?  Not only is debt cancellation prohibited by the Treaty but it would be detrimental to everyone. From the outset, it would lead to a very significant drop in the flow of remittances or dividends that central banks transfer to the fiscal authorities in their respective countries at the end of each year. If you cancel part of the debt, profits would have to be used to cover that loss instead of being used to pay dividends. What you gain from the improvement in countries’ debt ratios would be offset over time with a lower flow of dividends paid by the ECB and the national central banks to the different governments. So from a merely arithmetical standpoint, that could be detrimental to everyone. What’s more, taking a decision of that kind could pose a risk to the central bank’s credibility, since it could be interpreted as fiscal dominance, which could undermine the effectiveness of our policies.  In your view, how has the Portuguese economy responded to the crisis?  The Portuguese economy has been hit hard by the pandemic because of the significant weight of the services sector. I think that social distancing for economies like the Portuguese economy, or the Greek or Spanish economies, is particularly difficult to observe, and that’s why the decline in Portugal’s GDP last year was bigger than the European average. One positive for Portugal is that from a fiscal standpoint, in terms of its fiscal deficit, it was in a good position when the pandemic hit. It had even recorded a surplus, which gave it more leeway. But on the other hand, it still has a very high debt ratio, which is a problem. So what we hope to see for Portugal is that, as containment measures start to be lifted as the vaccination programme progresses, we will start to see a significant improvement in economic activity levels in the second half of the year. And we hope that by mid-2022, GDP will be back to its pre-crisis level.  Are you concerned that, as debt levels rise, non-performing loans in Portugal might increase once more and that we might see another banking sector crisis?  I don’t want to talk about the specifics of any national banking sector. What I can say, not only for Portugal but in general, is that so far we have not seen a wave of insolvencies or non-performing loans. I think that has to do first of all with the support measures put in place in terms of labour retention schemes, public loan guarantee schemes and moratoria. These measures have been extremely important in helping to avoid an increase in insolvencies that could give rise to non-performing loans. At the same time, the ECB’s actions have ensured the maintenance of very favourable financing conditions. As a result, both in terms of liquidity and financial costs, we have avoided a negative vicious circle between businesses and banks.  But that doesn’t mean that it still couldn’t happen...  This takes me back to the point I made earlier. It is very important that the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is very gradual. Because if it isn’t, then the benign cycle that we have now could be transformed into a sort of vicious circle, which would be extremely negative.   And regarding the moratoria, is there anything the ECB can do to help banks?  Moratoria provide relief to corporates and households. But it’s important to remember that once the moratoria end, normal debt repayments will have to resume.   Do you think that the moratoria may have a bigger impact on bank ratios in some countries than in others?  A moratorium is a moratorium. It’s a helping hand in the short term, but in the medium term the culture of payment has to be maintained. It’s true that corporates and governments will have more debt at the end of the crisis, but the alternative would have been much worse.  This crisis has also made existing inequality levels worse. What can the ECB do to tackle this issue?  Inequality is a serious issue. Fiscal policy is the correct instrument to deal with that, through taxation and public expenditure, which can be much more targeted than monetary policy. As regards the measures taken by the ECB, they have been a very important driving force behind the economic recovery and the creation of jobs, particularly between 2013 and 2019. And that is very important in dealing with the issue of inequality. Job creation is the most important social policy you can apply.  Nevertheless, the ECB has been criticised for inflating asset prices – which ultimately benefits the rich more – through its asset purchase programme.  I don’t agree with that narrative. Our policies can of course have an impact on asset prices, but more importantly they have a greater impact on economic development and price stability.  But couldn’t you find other instruments to support the economy and employment that wouldn’t inflate asset prices?  All policies have side effects. In the case of monetary policy, what is very relevant is what we call the proportionality analysis. This means assessing whether or not our actions are limited to what is essential to achieve the objectives, and whether the main effect we are looking for – in this case the recovery of the economy, employment and inflation – clearly outweighs the potential side effects. We always conduct this proportionality analysis. Our policies over the last ten years have reduced interest rates quite a lot. This has undoubtedly benefited families that needed to buy a house and arrange a mortgage, and corporates, mainly SMEs, that needed funding. I therefore think that when you conduct a comprehensive analysis of our policies, in terms of equality, we have done more good than bad.  President Lagarde has said that, from a personal standpoint, she will try to ensure that ECB policies take climate change considerations into account. What’s your personal view on that?  I think that she’s right. It’s a bit like the inequality issue. The most powerful instruments to deal with climate change are environmental taxes, that’s quite obvious. But that doesn’t mean that other stakeholders have nothing to do. We can also contribute to the fight against climate change.  How?  We can start by analysing the impact climate change will have on inflation, because it’s going to have an impact for sure. At the same time, we have to look at the impact it could have on financial stability, because banks and insurance companies will be affected by the consequences of climate change. We have to make it very clear that a disorderly transition is much worse than an orderly one for the welfare of the European citizens.   Do you think this is something that could be reflected in your asset purchase programmes?  I think that we have to include climate change considerations when we analyse the solvency of companies whose assets we are going to buy. The solvency of debt issuers does not depend only on the quality of their balance sheet; we should also take into consideration the potential implications of climate change in the medium term. This is something that we have started to do with our non-monetary portfolio, which could be a first step.  The ECB is embarking on a project to create a digital euro. Is this something you are doing because you are afraid of the potential effect that crypto-currencies could have on your monetary policy?  It’s not a reaction to crypto-currencies. The main reason is that digitalisation has become increasingly relevant and the pandemic has accelerated the pace of digitalisation. For us, the digital euro is not an option, it’s something we just have to do. It’s not trivial in terms of the potential implications for financial stability and for monetary policy, so we will have to calibrate this project to minimise any potential negative consequences it could have.  But don’t crypto-currencies pose a risk to monetary policy?  First of all, let’s call them crypto-assets rather than crypto-currencies. Over and above the doubts about the use of these assets, one of the issues raised is that they are very volatile instruments. Their value is extremely volatile, so I think we should tell people to be careful, that these are very volatile assets, that the underlying fundamentals are not very clear. So far, however, this volatility has not had any implications in terms of financial stability.  The ECB has found it difficult to reach its inflation objective in the last ten years. Do you think it would be a good idea to change this objective?  Our primary objective is price stability, so our objective is for inflation to be “below, but close to” 2%. Up until 2003, it was below 2%. We have had difficulties reaching that objective, but you have to bear in mind that there were structural factors behind the low inflation rate, like globalisation, demographic change and online shopping. But more fundamentally, price stability should be maintained over the medium term and since the euro’s introduction, the average inflation rate in the euro area has been slightly above 1.6%. Having said that, the definition of price stability is one of the points we will look at as part of our strategy review. I think the issue of which instruments we use is much more important than the definition of price stability. In any case, what I would tell you is that monetary policy is always about evolution, not revolution. I don’t know what the Governing Council’s final decision will be, but I suppose that it will be an evolution compared with the definition we have at the moment.   "
2021-02-26,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Expansión,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andrés Stumpf on 22 February","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Expansión   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andrés Stumpf on 22 February 26 February 2021  After the Christmas holidays and a third wave of the pandemic, what’s the current situation of the European economy?  2021 is an unusual year. Some of the current restrictions on economic activity are going to be extended. But, while we’re facing these short-term risks, there is the prospect of vaccinations bringing a sea change in the second half of 2021. In the second quarter activity will already start to recover compared with current levels. The timing of this rebound will depend on how the public health situation develops, in terms of both the vaccinations and the delays that the mutations of the virus could cause.  If the restrictions are extended, will you revise down the macroeconomic projections at the next meeting in March?  It’s a bit early to answer that because we haven’t finished preparing them yet. The more severe the impact of the virus, the more prolonged will be the lockdown measures. And that can affect the projections in the near term. But we know from last year that when the economy is unlocked and activity recovers, there can be a fast rebound. The effect of the lockdown on economic activity is less than it was last year. The European economy has had to learn to live with these measures. It’s very difficult for the sectors most severely affected, but there are other sectors that are coping with the pandemic. China is growing at a good pace, which is good news for the world economy. So if the lockdown lasts a few weeks longer it won’t have much of an impact on the final growth picture in 2021. We think a lot of the pandemic shock will have been offset by the end of the year.  Doubts have recently arisen about a potential pick-up in inflation in the United States. Is this a concern in Europe too?  We are looking very carefully at measures of inflation compensation. What we are seeing is a mix of a rise in expected inflation and an increase in the inflation risk premium. And this is actually good news, because it shows that scenarios of the world economy heading into deflation are much less likely. Our December projections had inflation at 1.4% in 2023, so it is still very low and lots of support is still needed for it to climb upwards. What we’re seeing now is not a significant and persistent change in the path of inflation. At this stage, an excessive tightening in yields would be inconsistent with fighting the pandemic shock to the inflation path. That’s what we said, and that’s what we will be continuing to keep an eye on day by day.  Is there not a risk of the European economy overheating after unprecedented stimulus?  That’s an interesting debate for the United States, with the approval of new fiscal measures, but not so much for Europe. Here there’s no risk of overheating the economy with the stimulus. A lot has been done on the monetary policy side and fiscal policy has been very active, but at levels that are nowhere near the scale of the US stimulus.  Together with the inflation expectations, there has been a rise in yields. Could this become a problem if they continue to rise before the economy recovers?  This is the paradox of the financial markets and the overall economy. It can be problematic if market optimism moves ahead of the current state of the economy. We are carefully monitoring the rise in yields. These questions all come into sharp focus, especially when we have a new inflation forecast. In any case, it’s important to remember that our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) will be used flexibly in response to market conditions. We have our regular monetary policy meetings, but our market operations can also be conducted in a flexible way between meetings, if necessary.  Will debt purchases be able to address increases in bond yields if they are caused by a rise in expected inflation?  If you look at the size of the ECB balance sheet, the cumulative impact of asset purchasing has had a very large downward effect on the interest rates in Europe. This is a balance sheet view – that the overall stock of what we hold has a significant downward impact. The other mechanism, the “flow view”, is that if there are significant market movements – as there were in March 2020, for example – then the central bank stepping in can play a stabilising role. There is more than one mechanism through which asset purchasing can influence the market. But at the same time, it is crystal clear that we are not engaged in yield curve control, in the sense that we want to keep a particular yield constant. With the purchase programme we are trying to move the curve in a certain direction and with enough force to support inflation dynamics.  Do companies need more credit to survive?  Clearly there are limits to the amount of debt that firms can take on, and these limits are partly set by the firms themselves. The specifics depend on the individual country and the nature of the industries in that country, but there is a recognised role in this crisis for outright transfers or equity conversions. It is a major challenge for governments and there is no one way to tackle it.  The drop in demand for credit makes it difficult for banks to meet the ECB’s funding conditions with regard to maintaining lending volumes.  The targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) have a big incentive built in to maintain credit and lending to the real economy. In return for that, there’s a very low interest rate on offer. The banks might say that they would prefer less demanding targets but we have to strike that balance. In any case, funding conditions are still very favourable, even for those banks that don’t meet the TLTRO requirements.  Have you accepted that the take-up of liquidity by banks will be lower than in 2020?  It is not a proper comparison. In 2020 there was an extremely high demand for credit, whereas the current situation is different. What we should be looking at is whether our decision to extend the programme is benefiting the European economy, and we absolutely think it is.  How do you see the economic situation in Spain?  The virus is affecting all countries in Europe. But when you look more closely at the economic structures, the hardest-hit countries are those at the forefront of travel and tourism. Spain is in this group and there is no doubt that the pandemic has posed a bigger challenge here. This should be fully recognised. And it has been in the design of the Next Generation EU fiscal stimulus package and definitely will be in any type of forward-looking assessment. Spain’s path to recovery will look different from that of countries with economic structures that are not so focused on these sectors.  So the recovery will take longer then?  One of the differences will be the timing of the recovery, yes. But the nature of the recovery will also be different because of the importance of travel and tourism. It is a sector where there is pent-up demand – many people will want to go to Spain again. In other countries some sectors may be affected by structural changes, but I doubt that there will be a permanent shift away from tourism.  Spain will come out of the crisis with a high level of debt. Are you concerned about countries with debt-to-GDP ratios above 100%?   It is important to distinguish between the near and medium-term challenges. In the near term, in this environment of extremely low interest rates, the challenge is not the level of debt; the challenge lies in ensuring that the European economy makes it through the pandemic, in the sense of keeping as many workers and firms as possible in good shape, and in having a sustained recovery. Only once we have managed that, at a much later date, should we go back to thinking about the usual challenges related to fiscal policy. Right now the focus clearly should be on getting through this pandemic phase and having a good recovery.  Is a 60% debt-to-GDP level, as enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact, still desirable?  It is written into the EU Treaty and designed with the long-term perspective in mind. In the current situation of extremely low interest rates, debt levels that are higher than what we have become accustomed to can be considered sustainable. Once the pandemic is over, there should be a discussion about reducing debt ratios. But the important topic is not the preferred debt-to-GDP levels, it is the speed of adjustment, the measures taken and the macroeconomic context in which they take place. With the private sector saving a lot, we are not seeing the current account deficits we saw in the mid-2000s. So from a macroeconomic point of view, this situation is totally different. And, because this debt has been raised at very low interest rates, the financing of it is being absorbed by investors. It is not creating, at the moment of issuance, a significant immediate burden, in contrast to previous episodes. So in a lot of the debates progress has been made in updating beliefs about deficits and debt, but that conversation is not yet over.  What do you think about the surge in bitcoin? Could it pose a threat to central banks?  I think it is interesting to look at bitcoin as a crypto-asset instead of a crypto-currency because it is not particularly easy to use it to make payments. It has gone up considerably and we have seen similar situations before in the markets. If you ask somebody why they invested in bitcoin, in most cases the response will be that they expected the price to go up, and not that they did it because of the monetary policy situation. So we do not view the rise of bitcoin as a warning to central banks. An asset with no intrinsic value can go up in price because of the collective belief that its price will continue to rise, but that market has a risk of generating dramatic losses, and anyone thinking of investing in bitcoin needs to understand this risk.  If the recovery is delayed or there is another shock to the economy, does the ECB have any ammunition left?  Without a doubt. First, the ECB’s ability to create euro liquidity is a huge asset for Europe. Second, we always remind people in our policy statements that we retain the option to move the key policy rates lower. We remain confident that if we decided it was the correct decision to make, we could move interest rates. We have the asset purchase programmes and the TLTROs could be boosted, depending on the nature of the shock. Throughout this pandemic, the ECB has been quite effective in stabilising the European financial system and in creating the conditions for those who can benefit from low interest rates to take advantage of them. Under the current conditions, of course, a very large sector that can benefit from low interest rates and take advantage of them is the government sector. If there’s a negative shock, fiscal policy has a very powerful countercyclical role to play.  Does the ECB reiterating the need for fiscal policy to take a leading role suggest that monetary policy has reached its limit?  There is no limit of the sort that many people imagine. There is no hard limit. The issue is more about the efficiency or the scale. The recovery will be faster and the efficiency will be better if fiscal policy makes its contribution. In a low interest rate world (enabled by the ECB), fiscal policy is more effective in dealing with adverse macro shocks.   You always repeat this, but is lowering rates further really an option?  We wouldn’t say we could use this tool if we didn’t believe it. When we say that we can move rates lower [the deposit facility rate is currently -0.5 per cent], we do all sorts of calculations and analytics to make sure that it’s a credible and honest statement. What we have been saying all year is that, in the context of the crisis we have been going through, protecting credit through the TLTROs and making sure that the yield curve is at a low-enough level through the PEPP is the best combination. That logic still holds but the pandemic is of course not the only shock that could hit the economy and we have to be prepared. All the tools are available.  And what about the ones that have never been used, like purchasing bank debt or even shares?  We have a group of experts at the ECB and the national central banks who look at all the options. But under the current conditions we remain confident that the tools we have deployed up to now are the right ones for dealing with this situation and preserving the favourable financing conditions that are necessary for the recovery.   "
2021-02-25,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with LETA,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Ingūna Ukenābele on 22 February 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with LETA   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Ingūna Ukenābele on 22 February 2021 25 February 2021  How would you describe the current economic situation in the euro area?  In the course of the pandemic, we have experienced the deepest economic downturn since World War II. After the strong decline in economic activity following the first wave of infections in the spring of 2020, we saw a strong rebound, supported by the decisive fiscal and monetary policy response. This positive development was interrupted by increasing infection numbers towards the end of last year, also affecting economic activity at the start of 2021. With respect to the health situation, we continue to face substantial uncertainty due to the new variants of the virus, which is posing some downside risks to the short-term outlook. That being said, it seems that we are now much better able to deal with lockdowns than the first time around. There has been some adaptation, which means that the second lockdown will have less severe economic consequences than the first one. Moreover, we are seeing quite a few encouraging signs. First of all, we now have a vaccine. The vaccination is progressing slowly, but steadily. The world economy is recovering more quickly than we had anticipated. And the sizeable fiscal package envisaged by the Biden administration will likely have positive spillover effects in the euro area. So we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Looking ahead, fiscal and monetary policy support will remain crucial and must not be withdrawn prematurely. As regards monetary policy, we will ensure that there is no unwarranted tightening of financing conditions. A too abrupt increase in real interest rates on the back of improving global growth prospects could jeopardise the economic recovery. Therefore, we are monitoring financial market developments closely.  Once the pandemic starts to decline, can we expect to see a recovery as fast as the one we saw last summer?  It was encouraging to see how quickly the economy rebounded last year, and there is potential for a comparably quick recovery once the health crisis has been broadly contained. But the risk of scarring increases with the duration and frequency of lockdowns. This means that containing the virus must take absolute priority. Moreover, we should use the crisis as an opportunity for structural change. For example, we have seen a push towards a more digital economy. These shifts could support productivity growth in the future. That is why the efficient use of public funds, especially those of the “Next Generation EU” instrument, is so important. These funds should be used to foster the transition to a greener and more digital economy.  By how much will the euro area grow this year? When might it see a return to pre-crisis levels?  In our latest staff projections in December, we projected economic growth for the euro area to reach 3.9% in 2021. Due to the continued lockdowns, economic growth in the first quarter of 2021 may be somewhat weaker than expected. But in light of the positive developments to which I have alluded, the historically favourable financing conditions and an expansionary fiscal policy, annual growth is likely to be in the same ballpark as projected in December. Based on our current projections, the euro area economy should be back at its pre-crisis level by mid-2022.   Is there a risk that the crisis caused by the pandemic could lead to greater inequalities in development within the euro area since wealthy economies have invested more in aid and development programmes than their less wealthy counterparts?  At the beginning of the pandemic, one of the fears was that those countries hardest hit by the pandemic would not respond appropriately due to a lack of fiscal space. Contrary to these expectations, this has not been a general pattern during the crisis. The fiscal support package at European level plays an important role in this. But at the end of the day, what matters most is how public funds are used. Will they be channelled into productive investments? Will they be used to foster innovation? This is the best way to counter any potential divergence. Therefore, European funds need to be paid out quickly and then be used wisely.  Does the ECB pay attention to Member States’ programmes? In Latvia, for example, there has been a lot of criticism about the programme drafted by the Ministry of Finance.   These discussions are taking place in every country, and it is the European Commission’s role to evaluate these programmes. Overall, the policy response that we have seen in the euro area has been well-suited to counter the pandemic shock. Job retention schemes, which have kept around ten million people all over the euro area in work, have been crucial to prevent a sharp increase in unemployment. Another important component has been the support to corporates to avoid that firms that would be viable in normal times would be forced to file for bankruptcy. These were some of the most important steps taken and they have worked very well, particularly in combination with monetary policy, which has provided favourable financing conditions for firms, households and governments – thereby reinforcing the fiscal response.   Are there differences in how the crisis is being overcome by euro area countries and non-euro area EU countries?  Overall, the response to the crisis has been quite similar. EU countries outside the euro area have faced a serious second wave of infections, resulting in renewed lockdowns. As EU members, they also have access to the “Next Generation EU” programme. Monetary policy in those countries has responded to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. And the ECB has supported this response by providing euro liquidity through swap and repo lines.  Baltic states are some of the youngest members of the euro area. Is it easier for them to go through this crisis as euro area members given that some people still have their doubts about the single currency?  The Baltic states have also experienced a severe economic downturn due to the pandemic. But compared to the euro area as a whole, they have performed better: the decline in real GDP in 2020 has been among the smallest in the euro area. It is of course worth mentioning that their starting position was relatively good.  The ECB has provided crucial support to all euro area countries. During the financial market turbulence in March 2020, the ECB’s reaction was essential in order to prevent a severe financial crisis. Systemic risk indicators were at levels comparable to those observed at the time of the global financial crisis. Due to our swift policy response, the ECB was able to calm financial markets relatively quickly. Since then, the focus of monetary policy has shifted to providing favourable financing conditions in order to bring inflation back to a level that is consistent with our medium-term aim. The pandemic has put downward pressure on inflation, which we have countered through the introduction of various crisis measures, particularly through our new asset purchase programme, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), and our longer-term refinancing operations.  The Baltic states have benefited substantially from all these measures. The euro has provided stability at a time of great uncertainty.   How long can the era of low interest rates last in your view? What will be the preconditions for this to change?  The low interest rate environment is driven by long-term structural trends such as demographics, which play an important role in the Baltic states, globalisation and a decline in productivity growth. There is a relatively strong desire to save and a subdued willingness to invest, which is putting downward pressure on interest rates not just in Europe, but across all advanced economies. These trends can of course reverse. For example, ageing societies may start to consume more, for example when it comes to medical services or long-term care. We may also see innovation, for example in green technologies. Such innovation could push up productivity growth, which would also boost investment. Whether this happens depends to a considerable extent on government policies, namely on structural policies and public investment.  We do not expect these long-term macroeconomic trends to reverse in the short term, but we shouldn't think that it will not happen at all. Anyone who has studied economic history knows that such trends can reverse. However, the timing is difficult to predict.  Do you see money being invested in the economy? In Latvia there is a feeling that low interest rates are not enough to lift the bank credit market, for example.  The pandemic is a time of exceptionally high uncertainty. In times like these, people typically save more. This could be forced saving due to the lockdowns, but of course part of these savings are precautionary because people are uncertain about the economic outlook. So there is typically more saving, and at the same time there is less investment because of high uncertainty. For the recovery, it is very important that consumers start consuming and firms start investing again. Confidence is key here, and both fiscal and monetary policy can help restore lost confidence and thereby stimulate demand.  How would you describe what is happening in financial markets, including the banking sector? How stable are eurozone banks at the moment? In many people’s minds, the word “crisis” means that there are problems with banks and their savings.  This crisis is very different from the global financial crisis. Banks entered this crisis in relatively good shape. That is also true for the Baltic banks. In particular, banks were relatively well capitalised, which meant that they could be part of the solution to this crisis rather than being the cause of the problem.  This rather benign development was supported by fiscal, supervisory and monetary policy.  On the fiscal side, we saw loan moratoria and guarantees, while supervisors relaxed their requirements. Both types of measures played a decisive role in supporting the banking sector. On the monetary policy side, central bank measures provided ample liquidity at highly favourable terms, which enabled banks to continue lending.  Due to the support measures, the number of insolvencies is currently very low. The critical point will be reached when these measures are phased out. There is the risk of a cliff effect that could spill over to the financial sector, and we could see an increase in non-performing loans. Our analysis shows that euro area banks should be able to cope with this as long as the support is not withdrawn too early and too abruptly, and as long as the overall conditions remain favourable, including the financing conditions provided by the ECB. But we should expect many firms to come out of this crisis with much higher debt levels.  How do the Baltic banks look in terms of this risk of non-performing loans?   The Baltic states are facing the same risk of a cliff effect. Many firms are experiencing rising indebtedness, and not all of them are going to survive. The pandemic creates challenges in all euro area countries.  In the Baltic and Nordic countries, preventing money laundering was a very hot topic before the pandemic. There were a number of scandals and strict rules were adopted. What is your assessment of the fight against money laundering in the euro area as a whole? Where are the biggest problems now?  The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is crucial to preserve the integrity of the financial sector and public trust in financial institutions. This is primarily the responsibility of national authorities, while the ECB is responsible for supervising significant banks in the euro area. Of course, we collaborate and exchange information. However, when it comes to cross-border issues, national responsibilities may not be sufficient. If there is limited enforcement in any single country, this can lead to negative spillover effects to the entire euro area. So I think a more European approach may be needed. This starts with further harmonising national rules. Moreover, it should be considered whether the fight against money laundering could not be conducted more efficiently at the European level. These ideas are also included in the European Commission’s action plan on anti-money laundering.   Don’t you think the European Commission is being too slow here? We have been talking about these issues for years.  There are good reasons to argue that these issues should be tackled quickly. But elevating powers and responsibilities to the European level is a difficult political issue and takes time. Regarding harmonisation, some progress could be achieved more quickly.   When can we expect a digital euro?  The introduction of a digital euro is still an open issue. In October 2020, the ECB published its first report on a digital euro. This report served as the foundation for a public consultation process, which generated a lot of interest. We will most likely take a decision by the middle of the year as to whether we will launch a digital euro project, starting with an investigation phase. Of course, we are closely coordinating our plans with the European Commission. There are also important technical aspects that still need to be clarified. Let me stress that these discussions are still ongoing. No formal decision has been taken yet. The whole process will take several years.  Will there be public trust in a digital currency?  Public trust in a digital currency will be determined by the public trust in the central bank that issues it. There is a very high level of trust in the euro, and I have no doubt that we can generate the same level of trust in a digital euro.   "
2021-02-09,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Der Spiegel,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tim Bartz","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Der Spiegel   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tim Bartz 9 February 2021  Mr Panetta, ECB President Christine Lagarde has announced that within five years at the latest the central bank could introduce the digital euro. What is that? Why is it needed?  People are paying less and less with cash and more and more digitally, at supermarket checkouts or online. One in two Europeans would now prefer to pay digitally, and the pandemic has accelerated this development. As a supplement to cash, people want an efficient digital means of payment which protects data and is accepted throughout the euro area. We want to be able to respond to these demands swiftly, since the trend is going to grow stronger.   How will the digital euro work?  The details have not been settled yet; we have only just concluded the consultation phase. The aim of a digital euro would be to provide an alternative to other digital means of payment that is simple, universally accepted, safe and reliable. And we would continue to offer cash.  Up to what amount would you be able to pay digitally?  It’s not yet clear whether there would be a cap on payments. Ideally, there would not. However, there might be limits on how much digital euro you’re allowed to hold.   And it would be in a special account at the ECB?  Like cash, and unlike other means of payment, a digital euro would be a claim on the central bank rather than a claim on private financial services providers. Nevertheless, banks would play an important role in the distribution of the digital euro. You could compare it to cash, which people mostly get via their bank’s ATM.  So you will be competing directly with commercial banks in future?  No, we have explicitly and repeatedly stated that we want the banks to be our partners, not our competitors. We will offer safe money, not financial services. Offering financial services is the role of commercial banks. It would be crazy for us to do so. People already decide today whether to pay with cash, with various cards or online. In future they will have one more digital option, if they wish.   But people could transfer all their money into the ECB account in the hope that it would be safer there. The next financial crisis is certain to come.  That will not be the case. We might only allow digital euro holdings up to a certain threshold, or make them unattractive above this amount by charging interest. For example, the threshold could be around €3,000, which would be far more than the cash requirements of most people today. But this is still under discussion.   Once again: people already use digital means of payment like Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal. Why is a digital euro also needed?  We received 8,000 responses during the consultation phase. What people are most concerned about is data protection. They consider it important that no improper use is made of their personal data, which is something that can be guaranteed by the central bank. Moreover, the availability of central bank money for payments ensures that people are not dependent on a few providers who dominate the market. Such providers could exploit their market power and charge excessive fees.   Nonetheless, people put all sorts of things on social networks. They clearly don’t care about data protection when they do that.   People also post photos, but certainly not their account details. Nobody does that. And people can trust the ECB to protect their privacy, as it has no commercial interest in personal data. And we don’t want to make profits from the digital euro either, so that’s another advantage.  But private providers don’t demand any money from users either.   Yes, but they take their margin from sellers, credit card companies or banks, and thus indirectly from users, as these costs are passed on in the prices they are charged.   It is doubtful whether anyone thinks about that when they’re at the supermarket checkout.  We won’t force anyone to pay with digital euro. But we do want to give people the opportunity to use a uniform, secure and cost-free means of payment that is accepted throughout the euro area. Exactly like the euro in cash form, but digital.  How much interest is there in the digital euro?  The public consultation on a digital euro was our most successful yet. It showed that privacy was the first priority of respondents. The digital euro would be ideal for that. A digital euro project would start with an investigation phase, which would allow us to further test the reaction and expectations of the public.  The ECB’s problem is not so much Apple Pay or Google Pay. With the digital euro, aren’t you primarily aiming to counter Facebook’s planned digital currency Libra or Bitcoin or even the digital yuan, which China’s central bank is working on? You are afraid of losing sovereignty over your own currency. If Libra or the yuan are successful, the ECB will no longer be able to properly conduct monetary policy.  Our main motivation is, of course, the digitalisation of the financial sector. We need a European option, and we don’t want a small group of companies dominating business and possibly raising fees. Should an economic zone as large as the euro area be left on the sidelines, when big tech and other central banks are forging ahead with the digitalisation of payments? I think not. We have to take part.   The ECB is also the banking supervisor for the euro area. If you deprive the commercial banks of deposits, they won’t have money to refinance themselves in the capital markets. They might have to knock on the ECB’s door to ask for liquidity. That would further increase the commercial banks’ dependence on the ECB. Aren’t you scoring an own goal?   No, the digital euro won’t destabilise the financial system and the banks. If people decide to turn some of their cash into digital euros, the banks won’t lose any deposits. And as I said, we will discourage large holdings of digital euro. If banks do in fact lose deposits, then we can make more liquidity available to them.  So I’m right?  But that would be within the framework of normal open market operations that we already carry out when, for instance, we lend to banks or purchase bonds. And banks have abundant excess reserves at the moment. Certainly more than will ever flow into a digital euro.   The open market operations are highly controversial, particularly in Germany.  Our actions are necessary in order to fulfil our mandate. I don’t see any problem in that. The ECB enjoys a high level of credibility in the euro area.  But what if no one wants your digital euros?  Then we haven’t done our job properly and will have to improve the quality of our offer. But I don’t see why people would turn down the offer. The unprecedented number of responses to our consultation is a positive sign.   You’re starting a bit late if you don’t want to launch the digital euro for five years.  We are not late; we are doing the same as other central banks. The market is evolving rapidly, but we need 100% security and a sound concept. That takes time.   What are the next steps?  In the early summer, we will present our preliminary analysis to the ECB’s Governing Council. It must then make a decision in principle on whether we should proceed. If so, the real work will begin, deciding on what the operational scope and technical solution for the digital euro should be. That will take at least 18 months. After that, the ECB’s Governing Council must make another decision, and then the solution could be implemented. Four or five years would be a realistic timescale. And we must consult with policymakers. The ECB has set up a working group with the European Commission.  Are you considering a trial period? The Chinese are already trialling the digital yuan in a district in the megacity of Shenzhen.  That would be a possibility. Trialling the digital euro in different cities would probably be a wise move.   "
2021-02-07,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Le Journal du Dimanche ,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie-Pierre Gröndahl and Hervé Gattegno","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Journal du Dimanche    Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie-Pierre Gröndahl and Hervé Gattegno 7 February 2021  There’s been a glut of bad news throughout Europe recently. How can we hold to the economic projections?   Uncertainties are indeed multiplying. As far as the economists at the ECB can remember, there have never been as many. Our projections are published every three months. One way of preserving a degree of optimism despite the current circumstances is simply to think back to the ECB’s projections released in September 2020 and the multiple uncertainties they took into account. What were the salient facts back then? The terms of the final Brexit deal were not yet known. The risks of a no-deal exit were still present, as much for the European Union as for the United Kingdom. On the pandemic front, no vaccines had been found and it was impossible to predict when they might become available. The US elections, of crucial importance for the whole world, had not yet been held. All of these major uncertainties have now been resolved, notably the most important one of all – the availability of reliable vaccines – because several have since been authorised by the competent international health authorities. That’s a new situation and it’s certainly a reason to be optimistic.   But is it enough to hope that 2021 will be a better year than the one before?   At the ECB we remain convinced that 2021 will be a recovery year. The economic recovery has been delayed, but not derailed. People are obviously waiting impatiently for it. We expect the upswing to gather pace around the middle of the year, even if the uncertainties persist. We are not immune to unknown risks surfacing. Let’s be clear: we will not see a return to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity before mid-2022.   What rate of growth do you expect for the euro area this year?   Around 4%. Maybe a little lower. This would already be a sharp increase relative to the contraction of 6.8% registered in the euro area in 2020. Everything will depend on the vaccination policies and the rollout of the campaigns. And on the economic measures taken by governments in response to health requirements.  On 21 July 2020, the European Heads of State and Government agreed on an exceptional recovery plan worth €750 billion. Are you concerned about the plan’s implementation?   There is no doubt that the current crisis has strengthened the European Union. The decision taken by the Member States to borrow jointly for the first time marks a moment of exceptional cohesion in the history of the European project. But the momentum must absolutely be kept up. The pandemic has an accelerating impact on everything: so we, too, need to speed up. You fight fire with fire. It’s better to act quickly, even if you might then have to backtrack to correct things that may have gone wrong.  The plan needs to be ratified in time for the European Commission to borrow as planned next June, and to then distribute the funds among the Member States of the European Union. In order for it to do so, all of the national recovery plans, comprising measures to promote green and digital transitions, will have to be submitted to the Commission very soon.   How will the ECB continue to act?  For its part, the ECB has been supporting households, firms and the Member States’ economies since the outset of the crisis. It acted extremely quickly, unveiling an initial €750 billion programme on 18 March 2020, followed by two other expansions amounting today to a total envelope of €1.85 trillion. Faced with the spread of the virus, it was important to prevent a fragmentation of financing conditions across euro area countries. We committed ourselves to remaining active in the markets until at least March 2022 in order to support and preserve financing conditions in Europe. Our preferred tool is the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which differs from the ECB’s other asset purchase programmes, for two reasons: it is an emergency programme targeted to this crisis, and it gives us the option of deviating from the usual limits if they stand in the way of the support we need to provide to euro area economies. It’s an exceptional and temporary tool. As I have been saying since March 2020, our commitment to the euro has no limits. We will act for as long as the pandemic is causing a crisis situation in the euro area. We think that the time horizon of March 2022 is reasonable and that the PEPP envelope is appropriate. But if the ECB’s Governing Council thinks there is a need to do more, over a longer period, we will do more. However, if the whole envelope does not need to be used, we will not use it in full. That’s the principle of flexibility.   Doesn’t this accommodative monetary policy stance create risks?   We don’t see anything that gives us cause for concern. We do not yet see property bubbles at the euro area level, but we see signs of overvaluations in some of the euro area’s major cities in France, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, for example. That said, it is vital that we continue to support lending across the entire economic system. Banks provide assets as collateral to the ECB and in return they receive funds at very low rates. They then use these funds to lend to firms. The priority is to ensure businesses have access to the funding they need. There is no alternative: when the economy is protected in this way, the ECB’s role is not to give one business priority over another. Collectively, we must give priority to growth, competition and innovation. At that point, the natural selection of companies will set in.   How should we react once the crisis is over?  Once the pandemic is over and the immediate economic crisis is behind us, we will have a tricky situation on our hands. We will have to be well organised. And not repeat past mistakes, like closing all the taps at once, cutting off both fiscal and monetary stimulus. Instead, we need to offer flexible support to our economies, and then reduce this support gradually as and when the pandemic subsides, and the recovery takes hold. Economies will then have to learn how to function again without the help of any of the exceptional measures that had to be introduced as a result of the crisis. I am not worried about this, because the capacity for recovery is strong. Our economies are resilient. To convince ourselves of this, we only have to look at the remarkable improvement recorded by the French economy in the third quarter of 2020, when quarterly growth rebounded by 18.5%.  Don’t the gaps between euro area Member States make it difficult to come up with a common monetary policy?  Above all else, the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has exacerbated any pre-existing gaps. That is why the Next Generation EU recovery plan is even more crucial, particularly the support it will provide through the grants given to each Member State, tailored precisely to their specific national situations. For example, Italy will receive around €200 billion in grants and loans. It is therefore vital that this exceptional solution is not wasted and that it is rolled out as soon as possible.  Concerns are surfacing about the very high debt levels of Member States. Is there any basis for these concerns?  There is no denying that our monetary policy would be more effective if there was a greater convergence of Member States’ economic policies. All euro area countries will emerge from this crisis with high levels of debt. There is no doubt that they will manage to repay this debt. Debt is managed over the long term. Investments made in sectors that are vital for the future will bring stronger growth. The recovery will create jobs and will therefore have a unifying effect. We are transitioning to a different economy, one that is more digital, greener, more committed to combatting climate change and to protecting biodiversity. It will also be driven by new values – which young people are already expressing through their job and career demands – which will meet a new set of parameters. Healthcare in particular is one of their main areas of focus.  A letter signed by 100 economists is calling for cancellation of the public debt owned by the ECB. How would you respond to them?  Cancelling this debt is inconceivable. It would be in violation of the EU Treaty which strictly prohibits monetary financing. This rule is a fundamental pillar of the common framework underpinning the euro. The EU Treaty has been agreed and ratified freely and voluntarily by EU Member States. Rather than expending so much energy asking for debt to be cancelled, it would be much more worthwhile to focus instead on how this debt should be used, on how public funds will be allocated, on which sectors we should invest in for the future. Those are the things we should currently be talking about.   Your predecessor Mario Draghi has been asked to form a new government in Italy. What is your view of his nomination?   Italy and Europe are fortunate that Mario Draghi has accepted the challenge of helping to end Italy’s economic and social crisis at a time when it is the euro area country hardest hit by the pandemic.  I have full confidence in Mario Draghi’s ability to rise to this challenge. He has all the requisite qualities: he has the knowledge, courage and humility needed to complete his new task, i.e. to restart the Italian economy with help from Europe.  Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, has become US treasury secretary. Is it good news?   Having a woman hold this position for the first time is wonderful news! What’s more, Janet Yellen has the ideal profile given the circumstances: she is an economist and a labour market specialist. Employment will play a crucial role in restarting the economy. She is also very warm and pleasant. She is as humble as she is brilliant. Her appointment will also help promote smooth economic relations between Europe and the United States. We will once again see a cooperative approach being taken in key areas, such as international trade and how to deal with the challenges of climate change.  You have called for the “greening” of monetary policy. Is this really part of a central bank’s mandate?  Absolutely. We all have a role to play in combatting climate change. The ECB is acting in accordance with its price stability mandate; climate change poses a risk to price stability, since it has an impact on growth, price levels and the economy in general. There is a legitimate legal basis for our stance. Public opinion is in favour of taking environmental, social and good governance criteria into account.   "
2021-01-31,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Markus Zydra on 26 January and published on 1 February 2021 as a shortened version in Süddeutsche Zeitung","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Markus Zydra on 26 January and published on 1 February 2021 as a shortened version in Süddeutsche Zeitung 31 January 2021  Mr Lane, the ECB aspires to be closer to the people. Distributing helicopter money would be a good way to go about that. Why does the ECB prefer to channel its support to banks rather than directly to citizens? Is this a taboo topic?  Of course we track the academic and the wider debate. But at the ECB we should focus on the policies that we are actually pursuing and the options that are on the table, and not the outer reaches of monetary theory.   Is the idea of helicopter money off the table for good?   It’s not particularly productive to engage in hypothetical discussions, but let me come back to the basic issue. We expect economic growth and inflation in the euro area to return to their pre-pandemic levels before the end of this year. Prior to the pandemic, inflation was hovering around 1 per cent, but with a dynamic where inflation would, over time, rise closer towards 2 per cent, it was not a crisis situation. If economic developments are reasonably stable and moderate, monetary policy should be similarly stable and moderate.   The ECB repeatedly emphasises that it would be prepared to loosen monetary policy even more in an emergency. What options are still open to you? Purchases of equities or bank bonds or something like that?  The ECB and the Eurosystem have many excellent monetary economists, so everything is considered at some level. But these measures are not part of our current toolbox. Our active toolbox is a combination of our short term rates, asset purchases, targeted lending and our forward guidance, which is not only about explaining today’s policy, but also about how we would respond to unfolding conditions in the future.   The ECB is working on a new strategy, one aspect of which is communication. The public expects you to better explain your decisions. Rightly so?   We are living in extrordinary times. Compared to 15 years ago, the role of central banks is very different now to perhaps its more traditional role. For example we are very active in quantitative easing and targeted lending to banks. All of this needs explaining. And the way people absorb information is also very different now, with the use of social media and a greater focus on visuals, for example. Through our “ECB Listens” event, for instance, we have received thousands of comments. It is clear that we need to explain our decisions to people clearly and in the simplest possible terms.   So let’s give it a try: many Germans take a poor view of the ECB’s zero rate policy. Convince the critics in simple words.   Low interest rates are a global development. We are experiencing a major structural change in the global economy. People want to save more but the global demand for investment is low. By comparison, the role of the central bank is secondary. Would it be that helpful to increase interest rates in this environment? Hardly, because it would make the situation worse, leading to more unemployment and less growth.  Is there no simpler way of explaining monetary policy?   I know of some comic strip-type presentations which attempt to do just that. We try as hard as we can to simplify, but we always need to be careful that simplification is not misleading. The most important factor is trust in the ECB: as a driver, I don’t need to know exactly how the engine operates. I need to trust the car dealer and the mechanic to do a good job. The same goes for monetary policy. Not everybody needs to be a financial expert.  Trust in the ECB has declined considerably over the past few years. That’s a bad thing for a central bank which sees itself as providing a service for citizens.   That’s true. The surveys show that people have more trust in the euro than they do in the ECB. This is a clear signal that we need to better explain our task and policies. Perhaps then the level of trust in us would go up.   Some say central banks are plumbers. Are you a plumber?   There are two dimensions to this. The first is: when we talk about the economy and interest rates, there is a whole machinery behind how the central bank connects the financial system and that really is similar to plumbing. The second is: Keynes once referred to economists as dentists, which is maybe similar to a plumber in some respect. People go to the dentist or call a plumber when they need one. Perhaps the same applies to central bankers.  Was it your childhood dream to become a central banker?  I grew up in Ireland in the 1980s, a time when the economy was in a bad state and unemployment was high. That was reinforced by the global financial crisis, during which Ireland suffered a lot from the boom-and-bust cycle. It was clear to me that economic policy had an important role to play in preventing these terrible outcomes. But the reason I studied economics was not just to understand the world, but maybe where I can, to play my part in making sure that economic policy, and in my particular role monetary policy, was supporting society and the economy. My move from academia to the Central Bank of Ireland, and now to the ECB, was very much in line with that.  The ECB has become the white knight in the euro area. Would you agree that without the ECB, the euro area governments would be incapable of carrying the debt burden?   Actually, over the past year, the far more important aspect has been the joint actions of European governments, especially the Next Generation EU facility. The major issue has been Europe standing together. That said, central banks are playing an important supporting role. But the reason for the low interest rates and our bond purchases are the low inflation pressures, which is also true in the United States and in the United Kingdom. We need to have a very supportive monetary policy, because without that we're not going to maintain stable prices and we're not going to bolster a recovery.  Still, the central bank is now the largest creditor of the euro area countries. Is there an upper limit to that support?  It’s important to keep in mind that sovereign bond purchasing is a worldwide phenomenon. There are increasingly high holdings by the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and other central banks. We now hold around 30% of all sovereign debt outstanding in the euro area. And we have safeguards in place. What we do is driven by the price stability mandate and asset purchase programmes are only required when inflation pressures are too weak and interest rates are already very low.  European Commission surveys regularly show that people’s perception of the inflation rate is much higher than the official figure. Does this perceived level of inflation undermine the ECB’s credibility? After all, the ECB bases its monetary policy on the inflation rate.  It is inevitable that there are different perceptions of price changes in the general population. We look at whether our monetary policy decisions move perceptions of the inflation rate in the right direction. If anything, the fact that people across Europe perceive the inflation rate in different ways suggests that prices are stable overall. In countries with really high inflation rates, everyone is acutely aware of just how much the prices have increased.   Some economists have called for the ECB to cancel sovereign debt at some point. What is your response to that?  The simple answer is: no, we cannot do that, because the Treaties don’t allow sovereign debt cancellation. But, regardless of the legal aspects, cancelling debt would not be a good idea in general, and the debate is a digression. We are seeing that governments are able to issue a lot of debt and to do it at low interest rates in a sustainable way.  The ECB and European politicians have been speaking with one voice throughout the coronavirus crisis. They coordinate their actions, cooperate over support measures. Isn’t this closeness dangerous?   We all have a problem to solve. I don’t need to speak to a finance minister to discover that we need a loose monetary policy. Equally, every politician knows that governments need to invest more. So it is quite obvious that in this situation monetary policy and fiscal policy are pushing in the same direction. But I think life is made easier for everyone by good communication between the Eurogroup and the ECB so that they have a good understanding of our policy and we have a good understanding of what the finance ministers are up to. But this does not affect our independence. Indeed, the ECB is the most independent central bank. And there are plenty of examples where the ECB has tightened policy even if it might not have been convenient for governments.   The ECB wants to develop a “green” monetary policy. Environmental protection is a job for the politicians, not the central bank.   All sectors of the economy have to make sure that the way they operate is green and consistent with carbon transition, and that applies to the central bank as well. But the role of the central bank in the financial system means we can be a leader and a catalyst.  What is your relationship with ECB President Christine Lagarde like?  We have a very good strong relationship. She is an extremely impressive leader of the ECB, with decades of leadership experience at the IMF, running a global law firm, and of course her time in the French government. Leadership is also about making sure that the senior team works well, and there is a strong team spirit at the ECB.  For a while, the two of you were struggling with communicating your decisions. Ms Lagarde presented the decisions at the press conference and a day later you wrote your own blog. Are you better placed to explain the technical details than Ms Lagarde?  It was not my intention to give that impression, and it’s wrong. Our monetary policy is a team effort – I, as chief economist, work in close coordination and agreement with the President. The intention was to reinforce and support the communication of our monetary policy decisions across multiple channels. But perhaps it was all a bit too much. I stopped doing the blog on the day after the press conference in the autumn, because if it led to perceptions of difference, then it was problematic.   The ECB’s working language is English, and you are the only member of the Executive Board who is a native speaker. What is it like?  People at the ECB have very good English. Of course, it makes my life easier because it’s my primary language. That said, my Irish accent maybe adds a facet to the diversity of spoken English at the ECB!   "
2021-01-31,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Deutschlandfunk,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Klemens Kindermann on 29 January 2021 and published on 31 January 2021 ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Deutschlandfunk   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Klemens Kindermann on 29 January 2021 and published on 31 January 2021  31 January 2021  Perhaps a question of general interest to start off with: how is the ECB operating during the coronavirus pandemic? Is everyone working from home?  The ECB put some comprehensive measures in place very early on. And this means that the vast majority of our people have been working from home for many months now. To be honest, I find it really remarkable how well it has worked because the ECB is a very complex institution that now is almost completely in teleworking mode.  Talking of coronavirus: the pandemic has caused the euro area economy to collapse – by 5% in Germany alone last year. The prospect of a vaccine has made many more optimistic about the year 2021. Now there are problems with vaccine distribution. There are coronavirus mutations. There are numerous lockdowns all over Europe. Is there a threat of another setback for the economy?  The pandemic has led to the biggest economic collapse since the Second World War. There was a dramatic decline in the wake of the first lockdown. And then there was an unexpectedly strong recovery over the course of the year. Unfortunately, this has now been interrupted by the second wave of the virus. It is becoming apparent that the euro area suffered negative growth in the fourth quarter of last year. In the light of the worsening health situation in many countries, a very weak first quarter is to be expected this year. The speed of the vaccination rollout will now be decisive because ultimately that will be the only way to contain the pandemic in the longer term. And then when the lockdown measures are lifted again, we could see another strong recovery similar to what we saw last year.   Where do you see the euro area economy at the end of the year then? Will we have seen significant growth over the course of the whole year?  There will, of course, be positive growth this year. We see growth for the euro area at close to 4% for the current year. Nonetheless we will not have reached pre-crisis GDP levels even by the end of this year.   The European Union came together to agree on a €750 billion plan to combat the coronavirus crisis. Is that enough money to alleviate the economic problems caused by the pandemic?  First, I would like to emphasise what a great achievement it is to have succeeded in finding a European response to this crisis. And now the first thing to do is to actually implement it and put this really quite large programme into practice. Above all, it needs to be ensured that these funds are used sensibly. It is paramount to succeed in returning the euro area economy to a path of higher sustainable growth after the crisis. To achieve this, it is essential that the money is used to invest to support structural change, namely in the direction of a more digital and greener economy.   When you say it depends on implementing this quickly – the money is only supposed to start flowing in the middle of this year at the earliest. Is that good enough? Don’t things have to move faster than that?  The countries themselves have already done quite a lot and they will continue to do that. These measures on the national level are also very important. But certainly one has to speed up a little bit so that these European tools become available soon and so they can be used.  You mention activities on the national level. Much depends on how the national governments in the euro area combat the economic consequences of the pandemic. Some national governments – like Germany – can provide more economic support than others. Is that a problem for the recovery of the euro area as a whole?  The crisis indeed affects different euro area countries in different ways. And this is primarily because certain sectors are being hit harder by the crisis than others. We are seeing a slump in the services sector, while areas like manufacturing have been less severely affected and are now profiting, for example, from the fact that China has recovered quickly. This has led to a certain divergence in the euro area. In addition, countries that were particularly severely affected – because they have very large tourism sectors, for instance – were also those that were already in a weaker initial situation and had less fiscal space. This is why it is so important that there is a European response to this crisis.   Many euro area states, especially those that you were just talking about, are significantly increasing their levels of indebtedness. Is that not dangerous?  In view of the difficulties of the pandemic, massive government measures are required. This has to be financed through increased debt. If it hadn’t been for these measures, these countries would have fallen into a much deeper crisis. Just think about the short-time work schemes that are so important in ensuring that people can keep their jobs. Without the measures, many viable firms would have gone under. If these measures had not been taken, the crisis would have been much deeper. And that could even have led to higher levels of debt in the medium term. It is crucial that the countries succeed in returning to a sustainable growth path in order to manage the increased debt levels. If the countries return to strong growth after the pandemic, then the higher levels of debt aren’t a problem.  So, to ask one more time, you don’t see a new sovereign debt crisis coming?  No, I don’t see that coming.  There is a discussion in Germany at the moment about suspending what is known as the debt brake [the constitutional limit to the ability of federal and state governments to take on new debt] for a number of years. How do things stand at the European level? Because the rule that limits deficits to 3% of economic output for EU Member States is currently suspended in the light of pandemic-related deficit spending. Would it not also make sense to consider suspending the rule over a number of years so as to afford the countries more space for the future?  It was certainly important for the European rules to be temporarily suspended. It is equally important to return to a framework of fiscal rules after the pandemic. But there is broad consensus about the need to reform these rules – above all, because the rules are not binding enough in good times and are too restrictive in bad times. This limits their effectiveness. And that is why I think it makes sense to consider modifying the regulatory framework.  Ms Schnabel, last year the ECB initiated a massive emergency bond purchase programme to counter the economic consequences of the pandemic, which was increased again in December. How can you explain these huge sums to our listeners? Why does it have to be a truly incredible 1.85 trillion euro?  Let me reiterate that we are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Second World War. And extraordinary situations call for extraordinary measures. 2020 saw dramatic upheavals on the financial markets, which were reminiscent of the upheavals at the time of the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009. The markets collapsed. Liquidity dried up. And at the same time, many companies desperately needed liquidity as their revenues had crumbled. And that was the situation in which the ECB – fortunately, you might say – responded very quickly and adopted a wide-ranging package of measures that had two main components. One was to provide liquidity on a large scale to banks at very low terms. And then there was the new bond purchasing programme that you mentioned, characterised by a large degree of flexibility. With this package of measures, we succeeded in calming the financial markets relatively quickly. But I would like to emphasise that the real turning point in the crisis did not arrive until agreement emerged on the European rescue package. And this is where you can see very well how in this crisis, unlike in earlier crises, monetary and fiscal measures reinforced each other, by which I mean they multiplied each other’s impact. And that was very important.  Does this mean that the bond purchases under this emergency programme known as PEPP do not have be increased again?  That depends on how the pandemic evolves. The economic performance will largely be determined by how quickly we manage to reach what is known as herd immunity. And this is where vaccination will play a key role. In December, we already extended our programmes as it was becoming evident that the pandemic would also last a lot longer. We have extended them up until March and June of next year. We do of course hope that that will be enough.  Particularly highly indebted euro area states have to pay a premium on their sovereign bond yields, if they want to take on more debt. The question is this: Does the ECB targeted purchases of sovereign bonds from these countries in order to keep down these premia?  Our purchase programmes are set up in such a way that we make purchases in line with what is known as the ECB capital key. Roughly, the shares correspond to each country’s share of gross domestic product in the euro area as a whole. However, the new bond purchase programme has been set up with a special form of flexibility that would make it possible in a crisis to buy more bonds in those countries suffering particular dislocations. This is because we wanted to ensure that common monetary policy reaches the euro area as a whole. We had precisely a situation like this in March of last year, when a clear fragmentation occurred in the euro area. At that point, bonds of certain euro area countries were bought in larger amounts. The situation calmed down quickly and it was no longer necessary to buy more bonds from certain countries. This then also led to a decline in the deviations from the capital key.  Well, in its spectacular ECB judgement last year, the German Constitutional Court had ruled that the ECB needed to comply with precisely this capital key. Does that mean the parameters set by the Constitutional Court, to which the ECB is not actually fully obliged, are met as far as you’re concerned?  Absolutely. What the Constitutional Court specifically highlighted was that our measures need to be proportionate. And that has always been a major concern of ours. In other words, when we make decisions on measures, we need to consider whether these measures are effective, whether they are appropriate and whether other measures would possibly be more effective. And, of course, whether the measures cause side effects that are possibly greater than their positive effects. And this review is something we do continuously, and it plays an important role when we decide which measures are taken.   You’ve explained quite clearly that, with these bond purchases, you’re keeping the financing conditions favourable for enterprises and for states, thus supporting the economy. But is that your mandate in the first place? Isn’t your mandate actually to safeguard price stability in the euro area?  Yes, you are of course completely right. The goal is to safeguard price stability. But this is done by stimulating the economy. This requires the financing conditions in the euro area to be favourable for households and for enterprises.   Not only are you buying bonds, you’re also keeping interest rates low. The benchmark rate has been at a record low of 0.0% since March 2016. How long will we need to wait until interest rates start rising in the euro area?  First of all, I would like to point out that the low interest rate environment is not attributable solely to the ECB’s monetary policy. This is being driven by long-term macroeconomic trends. Due to the global demographic situation, more is being saved. And at the same time, less is being invested because productivity growth has declined. That is a global phenomenon over which central banks have little influence. This excess saving has led to interest rates falling. This is not first and foremost the result of central bank policy; instead, it has to do with the underlying macroeconomic factors. Monetary policy has to deal with these circumstances. In order to stimulate the economy, interest rates need to be set even lower. I can of course not predict when interest rates might be raised. What I can tell you, though, is that raising interest rates in the current situation would have disastrous effects. Seen in that light, that is not something anyone should wish for.  Excess savings is, however, the right keyword. What would you say to savers who have seen no interest accumulating in their accounts but who actually want to put something aside for their old age?  For savers, the current interest rate environment is difficult. But people are, of course, not just savers. They are also borrowers. Borrowers benefit from low interest rates. And, in addition, low interest rates stimulate the economy, as I described earlier. Among other things, this means that this low interest rate policy has had a positive impact on the labour market. Many people have kept their jobs or found a new job because, thanks to the expansionary monetary policy, the economy has performed better. Seen in that light, it’s not helpful to view interest rates in isolation. Most euro area citizens have benefited from our policy.  We’re currently observing a sharp rise in yields on long-dated US government bonds. This is usually the precursor of higher inflation expectations. Should the ECB already be starting to change direction, getting ready for higher inflation?  What we’re seeing is an interesting short-term movement. The first estimates of the January inflation rate in Germany have just been published. And they were surprisingly high.  True, but this is down to the VAT cut and the price of CO2, isn’t it?  Indeed. In the first instance, it is these one-off effects that are responsible. Moreover, it’s not easy to measure inflation right now because our basket of goods has changed significantly. We have almost stopped consuming certain things altogether – we’re no longer eating out, going to the hairdresser’s or travelling. All of this is reflected in the basket of goods considered for inflation measurement. The weights of individual goods in the basket have shifted significantly. As a result, it is very difficult to compare the figures over time. Besides, this year we are also going to see base effects in the price of energy. Last year, energy prices plummeted. This means that one year later, we will see that inflation will be particularly high. We are expecting the inflation rate to pick up in the course of this year. We must be careful, however, not to mistake these short-term developments for a sustained increase in inflation. We are faced with very weak demand. And it does not look like this is going to fundamentally change. This is why we continue to be more worried about inflation being too low rather than too high.  The ECB intends not only to scrutinise its monetary policy but also to communicate better. This interview is certainly part of that approach. What else, Ms Schnabel?  We are facing a very challenging economic situation and we need to see how we can bring inflation closer to levels that are consistent with our inflation target. We are currently conducting a thorough review of our strategy. The review will look at several topics, including communication, as you mentioned. It is a topic that is particularly close to my heart. Climate change is another topic that we’re looking at.   Indeed, this week the ECB set up, or announced the setting up of, a climate change centre. Why does a central bank look after environmental protection? Aren’t others better equipped to do that?  The main responsibility for climate action lies with the governments. Central banks can contribute to a more limited extent. But no one can ignore the fact that climate change is the greatest challenge to society, much greater even than the pandemic. The ECB cannot ignore it. This is why we ask ourselves which role we can play, within our mandate, in combating climate change.  Does this mean buying green bonds?  It means many different things. We must ask ourselves how we take climate change into account in our economic models. Traditionally, climate change does not feature, and this is something we certainly have to change. We must ask ourselves what impact climate change has on risk assessment. This is important for banking supervision, but also for monetary policy. Then we must ask ourselves what climate change means for our monetary policy operations. And as an institution, we need to think about how we can get greener, how much business travel is necessary, how we invest our pension funds.  I have to ask again – should the ECB also buy green bonds?  This is a topic that’s being discussed as part of our strategy review. But, in fact, the ECB is buying green bonds in not insignificant amounts already. The question, therefore, really is whether the ECB should buy more green bonds than its share in the current market. And this is a question that’s provoking a lot of controversy, but it will be a significant part of our strategy review.  What will happen when the ECB reduces its bond purchases because, for example, of a threat of higher inflation? We already spoke about this. Will the extent of climate action depend on inflation then?  It must be equally possible to increase and to decrease bond purchases. And when we do, we must not be guided by any considerations other than that of our primary mandate, which is price stability.  To finish off with, let’s talk about the digital euro, which is something that you’re also planning to embark on, or at least are considering. What would it look like? Do you want to compete with Bitcoin?  Digitalisation affects all aspects of our lives, a trend that the pandemic strengthened further. This is also clear when you look at how people pay for things. Digital payments now play a bigger role. A digital euro would give citizens access to secure central bank money. You can think about it as banknotes in digital form. It is not about replacing cash, which is still very popular in the euro area. A digital euro would just be an alternative form of money. We are seeing a lot of different developments in this field. Private digital currencies are being developed, other currency areas are considering creating digital money. The ECB needs to be prepared and able to potentially issue its own digital currency to secure monetary sovereignty. But let me stress that no decision has been made yet. A lot of preliminary work needs to be done first. Nevertheless, it is of course a topic that the ECB needs to tackle in this digital age.  When you say “other currency areas” I’m guessing you mean China. Work on this has been going on there for more than five years now. The digital yuan is being trialled already, people are being randomly selected to test it. Can you even catch up with China?  Some countries were quicker than others to launch such projects. But it’s not like that boat has sailed. What’s important is to properly prepare for a digital euro so that if we do introduce it, it is a well thought-out and robust system. I don’t think it would make sense to rush into this and launch a half-finished concept. Money is simply too important.  Facebook now wants to launch its own currency, called Diem. It was referred to as Libra before. Would it compete with the euro?  First we need to ask whether these so-called private currencies can be considered as real currencies, or whether they’re simply investment products. A currency needs to have very specific features. Trust is a very important one. I doubt that a private provider can ever manage to inspire trust like the ECB does.  We’re almost finished, but I’d still like to ask you one last question, if I may, Ms Schnabel.  Of course.  How do you invest your own money?  You can look it up on our website – not the amounts, but the names of assets. Of course, we have certain restrictions. For example, we are not allowed to invest in financial institutions because we supervise them. But I always try to invest in future-oriented areas, like digital, green and of course ETFs.   "
2021-01-27,Philip R. Lane,Interview with SKAI TV,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Elena Laskari on 26 January 2021","   INTERVIEW  Interview with SKAI TV   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Elena Laskari on 26 January 2021 27 January 2021  Euro area economies are still under pressure because of the second wave of the pandemic and it is still unclear if we are closer to the end of the tunnel or closer to a third wave. According to the ECB’s forecasts, how many years will it take for our economies to heal the scars of the pandemic and return to where they were in 2019?  There’s no doubt that in the near term it’s a difficult situation. Many parts of the European economy are under some kind of lockdown measure right now, but we think this is maybe more delaying the recovery rather than posing a major long-term problem. So, we still think that by the middle of next year, so maybe towards the end of the summer of 2022, we will have returned to 2019 levels of GDP. I think it’s important to say that this year will be a year where initially, right now, there are lots of restrictions. But over the course of the year, as the vaccination programmes are rolled out, we think the economy can grow quite quickly. So there will be a lot of recovery later this year and next year. I should emphasise that even if the overall economy does recover, not every sector will recover in the same way. So there will be scars in some sectors of the economy.  Until 2022, right?  Right, so another year, year-and-a-half.  Do these projections include Greece as well?  What I’m focusing on there is the overall European aggregate picture, but at this point the pandemic is fairly common, fairly general across countries. Now, of course, for economies like Greece for example, the recovery will be heavily dependent on the recovery of tourism. But again, this depends on the speed of the vaccination campaign.  Will the recovery be an easy process? Is there a risk of a new financial crisis following the pandemic?   It’s very important to emphasise that we think there will be a lot of momentum, so we will see a strong growth rate later this year and next year because essentially the pandemic is an artificial type of recession. We know that much of the recession is because we have to suspend normal economic activity. When that suspension is over there can be a strong recovery. But as I mentioned to you, if you have been losing income in this period because your restaurant, your hotel or your service industry has been compromised, that income is a loss to you. But in terms of the recovery, in terms of the recovery of demand, we do think it will be a significant recovery later this year and into next year.  But at the same time we’re witnessing a rally in the stock markets while the real economy is suffering and banks risk facing an “explosion” of non-performing loans. Do you think that stock markets are “irrationally exuberant”?  First of all, let me say that I am not an investment adviser, so I don’t take a stance on whether markets are correctly pricing the value of stocks. But again, this returns to my basic point here. We have another year, year-and-a-half of this pandemic. But from the point of view of the stock markets, they look forward, not just to this year and next year, but many years into the future. So the stock markets are confident that there will be a recovery later this year and next year. On the point you mentioned about non-performing loans: of course, we do think there will be an increase. But to respond to your general question about the issue of the financial crisis: so much has been done. So much has been done by governments in terms of all sorts of subsidy programmes. We are maintaining favourable financing conditions at the ECB. A lot has been done, measures have been taken to counteract that risk, so I would not be disproportionately concerned about the financial damage of this pandemic.  Regarding Greece, the end of the pandemic will find the country with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 200 per cent and possibly still without an investment grade. Do you think that, after almost ten years of economic crisis and adjustment programmes here in Greece, we will need a new programme? And how would this relate to the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)?  I think the overriding point is that the increase in public debt is everywhere. There’s a large increase in public debt across the world. First of all, the most important point to mention is that this has been necessary. It has been inescapable that in a pandemic the government has to do a lot. In that context, I think there’s a very natural reason why public debt has increased. And what we see is a low interest rate environment. So the ability to finance this debt, the ability to service this debt – we think even at high debt levels – is much easier than before. That does not remove the longer-term issue that high debt levels will need careful monitoring. But they will be more easily managed over the long term because the more quickly the economy grows, the more reforms are introduced over time to support a fast-growing economy. This is why the Next Generation EU plan is so important. There’s now a common European initiative with common funding to support an acceleration of digitalisation and the green economy, and many initiatives that will support a faster-growing European economy.  Last March, Mario Draghi wrote in the “Financial Times” that we are facing a war, and that wars are financed by increases in public debt. That is what we are seeing; that’s what’s happening. Do you think that the return to normality could or should include the cancellation of debts – private, as Mr Draghi has suggested, and/or public, as some others are saying?  Let me emphasise that a little bit. So much has happened since then in terms of the amount of support offered by governments in order to make sure that firms and households are supported as far as possible during this pandemic. So, if you like, the prospect of a lot of unsustainable debt in the private sector has been curtailed by the amount of fiscal support. Then, let me go back to what I said already. The most important issue is that in a world of very low interest rates the capacity to manage this debt is much greater than was maybe envisaged last March. Of course, again, to reiterate the bottom line: the cancellation of public debt is not part of the Treaty for the ECB. More generally, I think the focus should be on re-emphasising the importance of the roles of the governments at this point, the importance of the EU common funding which we have in place, the importance of accelerating growth rates after the pandemic, and to put all of that in the context of this, as you say, really large event, like a war. It’s temporary. We know it’s only going to last another year, year-and-a-half in terms of its main economic impact and therefore these extraordinary measures can be sustained, because it’s only for a relatively brief period of time compared with the normal business cycle or financial cycle.

2021-01-12,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Der Standard,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andras Szigètvari on 7 January 2021 und published on 12 January 2021 ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Der Standard   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andras Szigètvari on 7 January 2021 und published on 12 January 2021  12 January 2021  Is there still such a thing as inflation?  Inflation is not dead. Compared with the long course of economic history, inflation has only been as low as it is now for a relatively small number of years. And just because we are now in a phase when a particular phenomenon does not appear is no reason for assuming that it no longer exists.   What evidence do you have for this?   The fact that inflation has been so low for several years is mainly due to structural changes in our economy. Globalisation, especially China’s entry into world trade, has increased the global labour supply, while reducing employees’ bargaining power and therefore wage growth. That has exerted downward pressure on prices. Moreover, digitalisation has brought more price transparency and so more competition, just think of online shopping. Demographics may play a role too: owing to the ageing of western society, people have on average saved more while investing less. But these factors may change again.   What would cause them to change?  Some economists, such as Charles Goodhart, argue that inflation will increase markedly again because these factors could reverse. Demographic ageing could reduce the global labour supply, wages could rise and globalisation could abate. People who have put money aside for their old age could begin to spend more, without the supply of goods expanding to the same extent. In addition, digitalisation has led to an increase in market power in some areas. But such longer-term trends are extremely difficult to predict and things may also turn out differently.   In recent times the ECB’s projections have always been wrong: for years it has been predicting a rise in inflation, but that has never come about.   The past few years were a very unusual time. The economy was subject to a whole series of disinflationary shocks. First came the financial crisis, then the euro crisis. Such shocks are not captured in the models. The pandemic has now pushed inflation further down over the past few months. But we expect that will change and that, relative to the current negative levels, 2021 will see an increase in inflation.   Why is that?   The decline in energy prices was a major reason for the sharp fall in inflation in 2020. The temporary cuts in VAT also had a downward impact, especially in Germany, because that country has such a large weight in the index. The tax cut in Germany has now expired. And we should soon see a robust rise in energy prices relative to last year, because the prices were so low in the spring of 2020.   But will this be more than a flare-up of inflation?   Some momentum may well arise in the shorter term. Imagine if the vaccinations are completed more rapidly than some people now fear, enabling some return to normality in the summer. The prices for services, such as travel or eating out, may soar on the back of the pent-up demand. But such a short-term development should not be mistaken for a sustained increase in inflation, which is likely to only emerge very slowly. That is why it would not significantly influence our monetary policy decisions, which are oriented towards a medium-term horizon.   Consequent on the pandemic, the ECB will create €1.85 trillion in central bank money for the purchase of sovereign bonds. But unlike in the financial crisis in 2008, the banks are now assiduously issuing loans. The money supply is expanding. If inflation is not dead, will that not have profound effects?  At present there are no indications that we need to be concerned about inflation being too high. We see a pronounced weakness in demand. There is a danger that the crisis will have a scarring impact on the labour market. All in all, the main problem is probably that economic demand is too weak, rather than that capacity bottlenecks may arise, which is why prices are more likely to rise too slowly.   During the crisis, the ECB, through its many market interventions, has “gained a great deal of power, even though it is subject to hardly any parliamentary control”. This quotation stems from an interview with you in 2017. How do you see things today: during the pandemic the ECB has again gained significantly in importance?  The ECB is independent of politics, but it is bound by its mandate. For the ECB’s actions to be legitimate, it is essential that they are within its mandate and proportionate to that mandate. At the time of that interview, I made the point that in earlier crises the ECB had been left on its own by fiscal policy. Fortunately, today things are different. The pandemic is the deepest economic crisis the world has experienced since the Second World War. In such circumstances, all economic policy actors are called upon to take extraordinary measures. If you look at the financial market data from March 2020, you can see that we were heading into a severe financial crisis. The ECB succeeded, in tandem with fiscal policy, in preventing that financial crisis and an even harder economic downturn.   But what do you say to people who feel queasy about this amount of money and warn that it has got to have an impact?   The dilemma for the ECB and other central banks is that, owing to structural factors, we are confronted by a long-term decline in the general level of interest rates, as a result of which we have reached the limits of conventional monetary policy, i.e. interest rate policy. In such a situation, a central bank has no choice but to turn to other instruments, such as bond purchases. Only government policy can provide a remedy by ensuring sustainable growth and stimulating investment. Then the general level of interest rates will also rise again.   So governments must spend more?  Yes. But it’s not just about spending more, but about spending in the right way. Productivity and potential growth must be fostered. Simply raising transfers won’t help.   You are a German economist; in your country there was strong support for the “black zero” balanced budget dogma. Now you say governments must spend more.  Even in Germany there is widespread consensus that public spending and debt need to be increased during the pandemic. It would be a massive error to reduce spending or, in the middle of the pandemic, to begin saving because of concerns about increased debt. The question of public debt sustainability depends to a large extent on balancing interest rates and growth prospects. As long as growth is higher in the longer term than interest rates, there is no problem. So, if you want to reduce debt after the crisis, the best instrument is the promotion of economic growth.   In the euro area there are strict rules on debt and deficits. Does that mean these numerical targets are obsolete?   Those figures are not based on economics; they were political decisions. With low interest rates, sustainability is higher. More important than the specific figures, however, are the mechanisms of the fiscal rules. The current rules are too strict in bad times and too lax in good times.  According to modern monetary theory, the only limit to debt is inflation. Because that doesn’t appear to be a problem at present, you can spend handsomely. What is your view on this?   In modern monetary theory (MMT) it is, ultimately, disputed whether governments are subject to budget constraints at all. That is certainly not my perspective. When the pandemic is over, governments will need to create fiscal room for manoeuvre for future crises. One thing we have seen is that a country like Germany was in a relatively comfortable position because it had previously created fiscal space. However, one must be careful not to start consolidating too soon. That would be the biggest economic policy mistake that could be made – tightening monetary and fiscal policy too soon.    "
2020-12-18,Isabel Schnabel,Q&A on Twitter,"Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 17 December 2020","   INTERVIEW  Q&A on Twitter   Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 17 December 2020 18 December 2020 Good afternoon, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member @ecb. I’m looking forward to answer your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Join the conversation! #AskECB   #AskECB  Could you please summarise for someone without a formal education in economics: What functions does the ECB perform? How does the ECB affect the EU economy? What are the underlying economic principles that guide the ECB on its decisions?  Schnabel: The @ecb aims to avoid prices rising too fast or too slow so that consumers can rely on stable prices. In doing so, it helps the economy to recover from downturns & avoids the economy running hot. Decisions are based on our legal rules, economic analysis & data. #AskECB   Why the ECB decided not recalibrate the depo tiering system? Is still part of the tool kit?  Schnabel: The tiering system is working as intended, namely to preserve the accommodative impact of our negative interest rate policy while alleviating its most direct negative side effects for banks. We are continuously monitoring the development of excess liquidity. #AskECB   #AskECB  How would developing a truly European safe asset help with the transmission of ECB monetary policy? Thank you  @Isabel_Schnabel  Schnabel: Monetary policy in the euro area is complicated by the fact that there are 19 sovereign bond markets and that safe haven flows may cause fragmentation within the euro area. A European safe asset would mitigate such destabilising safe haven flows. #AskECB   The SNB just announced it will exclude all companies primarily active in coal mining from its portfolios. Does the ECB feel inspired?  #AskECB  Schnabel: It is very encouraging to see that other central banks are taking action in the fight against climate change. The @ecb will discuss its own potential actions with respect to climate change in our monetary policy strategy review. #AskECB   What the  @ecb  is thinking about the call of cancellation of national debts?  #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel  Schnabel: A cancellation of national debts would constitute a clear violation of the European Treaties. The debate is harmful and should be stopped. #AskECB   What type of fiscal commitments would help the ECB in the short run and in the long run? are you worried about the impact of the current monetary stance on asset prices, incl house prices?  Schnabel: In the short run fiscal support must not be withdrawn prematurely. In the long run we need a debate about common fiscal instruments at European level and a reform of the fiscal framework. We are monitoring the impact of our policies on asset prices carefully. #AskECB   #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel  Why does the ECB keep trying to boost growth when it has not been working for years and its bond buying is misaligned with the Paris Agreement which the EU has signed.  Schnabel: Our monetary policy is effective. Economic growth & inflation would be lower without it. Green bonds are part of our portfolio and help to reduce the carbon footprint. We are reflecting more on climate issues with respect to our policies in the strategy review. #AskECB   What can the  #ECB  do for reducing our carbon footprint? Given the historic threat and thus our historic duty, what will you personally (as ECB exec board member) do? Thank you,  @Isabel_Schnabel !  #AskECB   #ClimateChange  Schnabel: We are exploring how the @ecb can contribute to the fight against climate change within our mandate. I support this process in all relevant areas like economic modelling, risk assessment, disclosure, monetary policy operations and own investments. #AskECB   How prevalent is “group think” within the ECB and how is this avoided? And who leads who...the cb or the market as many previous episodes seem to suggest the latter?  #askECB  Schnabel: Group think is best avoided by involving people from diverse backgrounds in our decision-making. The ECB benefits from having people from all over the euro area. Gender equality is also important, and we are actively pursuing gender equality. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel  Warum weicht die EZB bei ihrem PSPP- u. PEPP-Programm signifikant von dem Verteilungsschlüssel gemäß Art. 29 der ESZB-Satzung ab (insb. Italien und Spanien), ohne dies öffentlich zu machen? Ist das Ihre Vorstellung von Transparenz?   Schnabel: The allocation of public asset purchases is guided by the capital key. The PEPP allows for deviations to counter fragmentation in the euro area. All deviations under the PEPP/PSPP can be inferred from our website #AskECB https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/pepp/html/index.en.html   “When will the PEPP draw to a close?”  Schnabel: Currently it is foreseen that net purchases are conducted until at least March 2022 and reinvestments until end-2023. The duration of the PEPP will depend on the evolution of the pandemic and its consequences for the economic and inflation outlook. #AskECB   #AskECB  Dear Isabel Are goals of ECB in confrontation with domestic fiscal policies of member nations as the stimulus might lead to lot deficits and debt for their economies  Schnabel: It is important that fiscal and monetary policies work hand in hand to overcome this deep crisis. The role of monetary policy is now to preserve favourable financing conditions and support the recovery. This will also improve the fiscal situation. #AskECB   How does ECB plan to reduce the risk of corporate zombification (apart from QE and QE's unintended consequences)?  Schnabel: Due to the specific character of this pandemic, the risk of zombification may be less pronounced than during other times. Please read my column with @laeven_luc & @gschepen, which proposes some policy measures #AskECB https://voxeu.org/article/zombification-europe-times-pandemic.   #AskECB  Are you concerned about the  #Target2  imbalances? Thank you  @Isabel_Schnabel   #ECB  Schnabel: A predominant share of the increase in TARGET2 balances are a technical consequence of our asset purchases as these are often conducted through financial centres. We are therefore not concerned about the evolution of TARGET2 balances. #AskECB   Keeping the corona recession in mind, am i right in the assumption that the base rate (interest) will stay very low for the foreseeable future?  #AskECB  Schnabel: The evolution of our policy rates depends on the inflation outlook, which is currently subdued. We expect rates to remain at present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2%. #AskECB   Do you think in the next decade we will see a time when there is no ECB support to the banks?  Schnabel: In a bank-based economy like the euro area, banks are key for the transmission of our monetary policy to the real economy. Therefore, liquidity-providing measures are a standard monetary policy instrument to affect lending conditions and inflation. #AskECB   why not to include housing cost to the HICP basket as many other countries do - USA,UK etc ?  #AskECB  Schnabel: The HICP, calculated independently by @EU_Eurostat@EU_Eurostat, already includes rents. In our strategy review we are currently looking into whether and how costs for owner-occupied housing could be included. The inclusion would have to be implemented by . #AskECB   #AskECB   tell me your policies improved the life of European citizens, didn't create more inequalities and didn't contribute to the zombification of European economies.  Schnabel: Our policies have avoided an even deeper economic recession and a financial crisis. They have protected jobs, which helps to mitigate the increase in inequality, which may occur due to the pandemic. We helped viable firms to bridge the deep downturn. #AskECB   #AskECB  Whenever you buy assets, does it occur to you that you are destroying the competition of the asset-holders? How can EU citizens run businesses that compete with the beneficiaries of unlimited free money?  Schnabel: Asset purchases benefit all sectors. Bond yields serve as the basis for all interest rates in the economy, including for bank lending rates paid by households and firms. #AskECB   #AskECB  What problem(s) will the digital euro solve that can't be solved in existing monetary system or infrastructure? and why?  Schnabel: Preserving access to public money in a digital world is a priority to central banks. A digital euro can complement market-based payment systems and leave more choice to consumers. #AskECB   What is the added benefit to the economy of having bond yields go from negative to further negative?  #askecb  Schnabel: We are examining this question as part our ongoing strategy review. The scope of policy transmission may indeed change when rates are very low. Please read my recent speech for more details. #AskECB https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp201104_2~9afd2bf0ad.en.html   #AskECB  In your opinion: What is the connection between the Central Banks’ monetary policy and asset prices, be it equities, be it real estate? Thank you  @Isabel_Schnabel .  #ECB  Schnabel: Lower interest rates tend to go along with higher asset prices. But lower rates are not just the consequence of monetary policy, but of long-term structural trends, like ageing and low productivity growth, leading to high savings and low investment. #AskECB   What is the process of the  #ecb  monetary policy strategy review?  #Who  decides and  #when ? Are there important  #milestones ? Thank you,  @Isabel_Schnabel   #askECB  Schnabel: We are conducting extensive analyses, and central banks across the euro area are hosting listening events with the public and with experts. The Governing Council expects to conclude the review in the 2nd half of 2021 #AskECB More information here https://ecb.europa.eu/home/search/review/html/workstreams.en.html   Why accept a longer return to the inflation target? Would never have been acceptable under Mario. Any inflation rate between 0% and 2% acceptable? A German-centric view of the world?  Schnabel: We took swift actions to counter the shock from the pandemic on our inflation outlook. We remain undeterred in our commitment to bring inflation back to our medium-term aim of below but close to 2%. But the speed of return depends on the shocks we are facing. #AskECB   #AskECB  How many watches does Frau Schnabel have?  Schnabel: Two :) #AskECB   How do you judge whether the strengthening of the EUR (both trade-weighted and vs USD) is: 1. Deflationary (and hence needs action) or 2. A reflection of better EU area growth prospects, which is inflationary in the medium term (and hence need no action)  #AskECB  Schnabel: The sources of shocks are important for the pass-through of exchange rate changes to inflation. Our analysis shows that several factors have been behind the recent appreciation of the euro, including prospects of a faster global recovery. #AskECB   With reference to the „EU taxonomy for sustainable activities“, would the ECB welcome an EU taxonomy for “polluting”or GHG-intensive activities and how could that positively affect ECB’s monetary policy and banking supervison with regard to its climate impact?  @Koalas_Eng   #AskECB  Schnabel: The European Commission’s taxonomy is an important first step in assessing climate impact. A more complete taxonomy, including less green activities, would be a useful complement. #AskECB   Sorry for all the hate on here, sadly it's 90% ECB haters who care enough to comment on this post. Not a true representation of the population. Yet - could we find a way to boost economic literacy in the EU?  Schnabel: Economy literacy is something I care about very much - not just when teaching at university but also now at the ECB. By improving our communication, we hope to also contribute to advancing economic literacy. But schools should also play a greater role here. #AskECB   How can the ECB, through its Single Supervisory Mechanism, prevent the banking sector from destroying our children's future through their fossil fuel investments?  #AskECB  Schnabel: The risks from climate change will be increasingly taken into account in the risk assessments of banks’ balance sheet. Please read the excellent speech by Andrea Enria on this topic. #AskECB https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/speeches/date/2020/html/ssm.sp200617~74d8539eda.en.html   Hi Isabel, 99.9% of people I know have never heard of digital euros and the rest couldn't care less. So what is the rationale for investigating it? Is it to ensure the monetary rate is applied consistently in the EZ ?  Schnabel: A digital euro is explored to ensure the access to public money in a digital world. Its potential introduction is not motivated by monetary policy reasons. Our public consultation has generated considerable interest. https://epsilon.escb.eu/limesurvey3/434111?lang=en. #AskECB   #AskECB  When will central banks stop creating financial INSTABILITY via artificial bubble of asset prices and stop making rich richer?  @Isabel_Schnabel   @Lagarde   @DallasFed   @JanetYellen   @federalreserve  Schnabel: The current pandemic is a good example of how the @ecb has supported financial stability by preventing a financial crisis. Our policies have also helped to protect millions of jobs, which mainly benefits people with lower incomes. #AskECB   #AskECB  what framework does ECB use to analyze the outcomes and impact of its policy decisions? How does ECB approach possible mistakes in the past and incorporates learnings in its decision framework?  Schnabel: To take policy decisions and assess their impacts we use a large suite of different models and analyses provided by ECB and Eurosystem staff. These models are constantly adjusted to take into account the changing economic environment, new data and methods. #AskECB   ""If there was proof that your actions cause massive social harm, would you stop?""  #askecb  Schnabel: We study the impact of our measures continuously and assess their proportionality, taking into account potential side effects. Our analyses have shown consistently that positive effects have exceeded negative ones. Otherwise, we would change our policies. #AskECB  Time to wrap up. Thanks a lot for your questions – I really enjoyed the chat and look forward to doing it again soon. Take care! #AskECB    "
2020-12-02,Philip R. Lane,Transcript of the fireside chat at Reuters Global Outlook Investment Summit ,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2020","   INTERVIEW  Transcript of the fireside chat at Reuters Global Outlook Investment Summit    Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2020 2 December 2020  The pandemic has of course dominated your year but after nine difficult months, might we be turning a corner? An effective vaccine puts the end of the pandemic in sight. But it’s going to take some time to deploy this vaccine, so 2021 is still going to be difficult. From your perspective, what’s the biggest challenge, the biggest risk in 2021?  As you indicate, what we have right now is a mixed story, which is the very good news that we have a credible route towards vaccination. That was, by the way, always the assumption in our baseline forecast, that there would be a medical solution rolled out in 2021. So, from our point of view, the fact that it looks like the vaccines are on their way confirms our baseline scenario and makes it less likely that we will have more severe scenarios. So, that’s very good news. But of course, the trick is we’re in the middle of the second wave. Of course, there is already some progress in containing the second wave. But the reality is – as I think all of the public health experts you will see on TV will tell you -- it’s going to be a mixed reality. We cannot live unrestricted lives until there is mass vaccination and, to me, the biggest challenge is making that adjustment: to realise and to benefit later in 2021 from as widespread vaccination as possible but, in the meantime, to reconcile the need to control the virus with the importance of supporting the economy.  If you translate that to monetary policy and your particular task in this, what does the ECB have to do in this period?   I think we’ve been clear and our most recent policy statement in October was extremely clear and really captures it: our role is to ensure favourable financing conditions. Right now, you can look at different measures. You can look at what’s happening in terms of risk-free rates, the sovereign bond market, the terms and conditions that banks charge their customers, which is a very important indicator in a bank-based system. So, if we can keep financing conditions where they are these days, at a low level, that supports the economic recovery and offsetting the pandemic shock to inflation. And in that world – we know and we’ve been saying that –,for example, fiscal policy can be very powerful. In a world with low interest rates, the multiplier effect of fiscal policy can be quite high, compared with normal conditions.   Even before the pandemic there was a tendency for deglobalisation, mostly on the back of trade tensions. Do you reckon this is temporary? Can there be a return to the sort of globalisation we saw in the past two to three decades?   I think it’s very important to differentiate between the policy decisions, so free trade, the attitudes of multinational firms and so on, and the technological issues to do with globalisation. What I think we have in fact been seeing in the last five or ten years is a plateau. After a period with the opening up of the former Soviet Union, the opening up of China and so on, the reduction in shipping costs, the digitisation, there was a big increase in global activity. You would need something that is driving down trade costs to see a resurrection of that. The fact that we have a high level of globalisation is relevant but let’s see what happens with the economics of trade costs and the economics of the differentials. So, in a world where, for example, wage differentials between the advanced economies and the emerging economies would narrow, then the economic case for a lot of offshoring, of chopping up the value chain, is less. And then in a world of geographic risk, climate change and so on, building redundancy into supply chains makes sense, which would mean more regional supply chains, not just global supply chains.   Do you see a risk that there would be an actual reversal in globalisation or merely just a slowdown?  I think that the economics of that is open. You can imagine a world where there are reasons why trade costs go up or the fundamental drivers of trade including, as I indicated to you, relative labour costs narrow, which we could see in a kind of market-driven way less by way of global trade. We also know that as countries get richer, the balance of spending moves from goods consumption to services consumption, which tends to be local. I’m not really a crystal ball gazer, I don’t need to make strong bets about the future of globalisation, but we do need to be open-minded. I do think, coming back to the basic point here, the force of hyperglobalisation – which surely contributed to anti-inflation pressures – is probably going to be weaker. That I do agree with.   From start to finish, the pandemic will have disrupted life for a year and a half and it’s quite difficult for an economy to survive so long without some form of permanent damage or scarring. Where in the economy do you expect permanent damage and how do we overcome this?   There will be problems to face but, of course, these would have been much more severe without the fiscal policy and monetary policy reaction, which has already been exceptional. Let me point to three areas. One is those sectors that were hit hardest. So, the travel industry, tourism; and then I think, looking ahead, now that we’ve got used to working from home more, also this issue about the future of offices. I’m sure it’s not going to return to where it was. I’m also equally sure the current working from home will not continue in the same way. So, I think there will be big challenges for certain industries.  On the macro level, if you think about employment, workers can move across industries but the experience of so many workers, the fact that so many people have worked less this year, in terms of accumulation of their skills, their experience, the loss of their income, there’s a negative from that. The last one is that so many firms have lost revenues this year. We know that, with weaker balance sheets, their investment plans for the coming years will be less. Their retained earnings have been depleted. So, there will be scarring effects through those channels.  One difference though, of course, with a pandemic, is that once the pandemic is over, it’s not the case that the tourism industry has permanently lost its desirability. Many people, in fact, will be very much wanting to return to normal holidaymaking, going to restaurants as normal and so on, once it’s fully safe to do so.  We struggled with structural problems even before the pandemic. Europe had low growth, low inflation, weak productivity growth. Is the pandemic going to amplify these already existing structural problems and what is the long-term implication of this amplification for monetary policy?   I’ll give a nuanced answer to that. There’s no doubt that the fight against the pandemic is using up a lot of resources. Those resources, in a different world, could have been directly applied to boosting investment, boosting digitalisation and fighting climate change. In that sense, the pandemic is absolutely a cost which has made it more difficult to make progress on other fronts. On the other hand, we have seen very important structural change this year. In the European context, the fact that we have the Next Generation EU fund agreed in terms of the plan, the focus on that for the next few years, supporting public investment in digitalisation and the green transition. That is an important support for post-pandemic recovery, post-pandemic structural transformation. So, I do think indirectly there have been some innovations this year, which will be helpful after the pandemic.   You of course mentioned the Next Generation EU fund, but that is now held up over political concerns. Do you see a risk that it will not happen or that it will be significantly delayed?   It’s not particularly my job to make political calculations. All we can say is that it’s very important that it gets implemented, that it creates a very strong bedrock of vision for the European economy for the coming years. So, it’s very important that this negotiation concludes with the plan agreed.  Just a few moments ago you hinted that perhaps the ECB’s job is not to lower borrowing costs further but to maintain them at their current levels, and of course President Lagarde and Isabel Schnabel made similar comments. Are we interpreting your words correctly that your aim is not to lower borrowing costs any further but ensure they persist longer?   Let me emphasise the near and medium-term perspectives on that. I’m going to remind you that, in our forward guidance, we do say that we are prepared to lower interest rates, if necessary, to support the convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim. So, in making these comments we are in no way suggesting that we are at the lower bound of our interest rate policy. But what we are emphasising, behind all of these comments, it’s a little bit like forward guidance. We know that the yield curve has drifted down to a low level. The forward guidance says look, you can not only think about ‘if I were to borrow today, what do I see?’. But it is a signal from the central bank that, in terms of the coming period, during this pandemic, we’re going to ensure favourable financing conditions. It provides a lot of reassurance. It reduces the risk of a sudden tightening of financing conditions, it should boost confidence, through that channel, in the same way as forward guidance does via interest rate policy. It’s not just interest rates today but we reassure you that interest rates are not going to rise until there is more pressure on inflation. So in that sense, it’s to provide the forward guidance, to provide the confidence in this world of uncertainty that it’s not the case – you are a firm or a household thinking about borrowing money – that you are going to face any kind of sudden reversal in financing conditions.   Next week you will of course recalibrate your policies and you made it clear the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and bank liquidity facilities will be the main instruments of your choice. But the ECB tends to work in packages, so should we expect you to touch other instruments as well or should we expect these two instruments to be the package?   From a policymaking point of view, we’re still nine days away. So it’s way too early to reach conclusions on that because, of course, the world evolves every day. But let me remind you, if you look at some of my speeches and others: we have done a lot of policies this year. Of course, the headline, the big ones are the PEPP and the revision of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) programme. But there is a wide array of policies in respect of collateral, in respect of swaps and repos and so on. So, I think it’s important not to infer that we are only looking at two programmes. But what is true is that these two programmes have been very effective ways to respond to the pandemic. It doesn’t rule out any other marginal policy but it does say: look, if these policies have proven to be an effective way to respond to the pandemic, then of course we have to look closely at them in the context of next week’s meeting.   One of these policies was to create a temporary purchase envelope of the asset purchase programme (APP), which was €120 billion but this is of course almost exhausted now. In retrospect, do you see the value in having such an envelope and, going forward, do you think you will still need an envelope for the APP?  This extra APP envelope came in before the PEPP was invented, almost six days earlier. So of course, at many levels, at the margin, in terms of asset purchasing under these pandemic conditions, now that we have the PEPP, you might think that should be the dominant asset purchasing. But it doesn’t rule it out. We always have to take a look at the APP, if is there a value to looking at the APP margin. So, I wouldn’t want to convey any signal about that. But in terms of the design of the PEPP compared with the APP, the flexibility of the PEPP, we think is a very good match for these pandemic conditions.   Isabel Schnabel, who is also an ECB Board member, last week made an argument for the case of returning inflation back to target somewhat more slowly. I don’t want to pit you against Ms Schnabel but in a speech just a few days later you made a very different argument about not being complacent, no delay in increasing inflation. These two statements seem to be contradictory but of course you might just explain they’re not. I’m curious how you reconcile these two views.  Let me offer one basic reconciliation. Isabel Schnabel, in the opening of that speech, made it clear that her speech was in the context of the strategy review. It was not a preview of the December monetary policy meeting, at least that’s my understanding. So these discussions about financial stability, the optimal speed to close the inflation gap, and so on, are all absolutely part of our strategy review and part of the global conversation about how you balance these different considerations as part of a monetary policy framework. She made clear that these are all big issues for our strategy review. More narrowly, in terms of the current conjuncture, what I’ve emphasised is essentially a two-step approach. So again, it’s not the case that we’re projecting we’re going to hit our inflation aim in the near term. The near-term [goal] is to undo the damage the pandemic has done to the inflation path. So that’s not going to deliver us the inflation aim over our projection horizon. But it’s important to break into steps the overall objective of getting inflation towards close to, but below, 2%. In terms of what we’re doing now, it’s useful to have to focus on saying look, let’s see if we can undo the damage of the pandemic, restore inflation to the trajectory it was on and then, of course, over time, it will be a sustained effort, as it has been since at least 2015, which goes back to the fact that we know it’s important to recognise that we’re going to move towards the inflation aim in a gradual way. But it’s very important that the momentum is there. It’s very difficult to live with a reversal of that momentum, to see inflation dropping. Right now, in the middle of a pandemic, we understand why inflation is so low. But it’s important that this doesn’t get locked in. It’s important that we restore momentum to the inflation path, in order to get us back on that trajectory which, over time and in a gradual way, will bring us to the inflation aim.  The question is, of course, timing. I’m curious, the first step in your two-step approach, what is the timeframe for that?   It remains an intrinsic element of our medium-term orientation that this does not correlate with a fixed calendar. It does depend on what shocks hit the European economy, on what other policies are in place, and so on. I think it’s a mistake to orientate to any one fixed calendar, however frustrating that might be for somebody who is trying to think about that. What I always say is that it’s important that we see the momentum, it’s important that we see inflation move in the right direction. Of course that cannot be immediate; we’re not trying to say that inflation in the first quarter of 2021 will respond to our current policies. But, over the time horizon of monetary policy, we have to see an improvement in the inflation path.  Inflation figures out this week showed a negative reading for the fourth month running, and already in the accounts you warned that negative inflation may persist for longer than you feared earlier. Given the information from this reading and over the last six weeks, are you becoming more pessimistic regarding the inflation path?   No, not especially, because we understand it. Part of it is the German indirect tax cut, which will be reversed. Part of it is, for example, categories which will be most heavily hit by the pandemic, such as tourism, airfares, hotel costs, all of those. Those have taken a big hit. But once the economy recovers then the very low prices in those sectors, which have been the case this autumn, will reverse to some extent. So it’s not so much the reversal of the very low inflation now, it’s going from the 1% tight range, once those are reversed, to bring inflation momentum up from 1 to the mid 1s towards 2. That’s going to be the big challenge.   You briefly discussed the strategy review just before. One of the questions about this strategy is what’s going to be the new inflation target. The Fed of course moved to average inflation targeting last August, and some members of the ECB’s Governing Council are also advocating either average targeting or some sort of make-up strategy. The IMF also said this is something the ECB should be looking at. What’s your view about a make-up strategy?   Time is too short to get into this too much. As we’ve said, no stone is going to be left unturned in this strategy review. All of those issues are definitely part of the strategy review. But let me drill into the key issue. The key issue is: how do you maintain expected inflation at your targeted level when the reality is that you’re going to spend a lot of time away from the target? The different types of make-up strategies are designed in order to support expectations remaining anchored at the target. I think that’s why there’s so much interest in make-up strategies. But also, it’s a matter of logic that there could be a very wide family of different strategies, which basically have the same intent, which is to make sure that medium-term expected inflation remains at the target, even when there are negative shocks. The policies to make all of that consistent, in terms of how you respond when you’re close to the lower bound, how you respond if inflation is temporarily just above the target, all of that needs to be worked through. But this is very much a global conversation. The academic world, the community of central bank economists, everyone is looking at that. But, of course, the precise expression of what is needed in terms of policy to support that could well vary across central banks.  The review is scheduled to last until mid-2021 but there is some talk that the inflation target itself could be agreed upon earlier. When do you think the ECB could communicate the new target?   Right now we’re super busy. We heard this phrase in the Brexit talks about the tunnel. You go into the tunnel and you don’t come out. We’re in the tunnel. Right now the focus has to be on our internal discussions, because whenever we communicate it has to be in a very constructive and structured way. I think that’s down the road. The focus right now has to be on the content of the review itself and we need the time and the space as indicated by that timeline you have. It is going to be the second half of 2021 before we conclude. It’s important we have that time and space to fully consider our new strategy.  Still, should we expect the target to be taken out and communicated earlier? Or do you think it should be one package at the end?  We’re not at the point of discussing that kind of issue. It’s in a very much earlier phase than that.  The Wall Street Journal this week reported that after some policy meetings over the last year you held private conversations with investment banks and economists to explain policy decisions. In retrospect, do you think these conversations, which were one-on-one conversations, if I understand correctly, were appropriate and do you plan to continue having such discussions?  It’s very important whenever policy officials such as myself interact with market participants that it’s done in a very systemic, structured, planned, transparent way. So, in this communication policy, I would have these calls with individual ECB watcher groups – that’s essentially the community. And it’s not one on one, of course, because our rules say it’s important that I am accompanied by staff members in those conversations for transparency and note-taking. This is a long-standing issue of how policy officials should interact with the market. One of the core principles is not to be engaged before we make a policy decision. That’s why we have a blackout period. Once we have made a policy decision, and by the way, the days, especially the quarterly meetings when we have the new projection, even after the press conference we publish the new projections. So it’s in order to see if the information, the new public information that’s come out that day, to see if there are any questions, to hear their feedback. It very much conforms with the key principles of how to interact with the market in relation to already published information. It’s not to front-run future decisions. So, the timing, I think we thought a lot about it. It’s a structured, systematic approach where we rotate across different types of ECB watchers. It’s transparent, it’s in my diary. It’s also true that we should always review and keep in mind our communication policy. It was a deliberate and structured approach in doing so, I think it’s part of a good communication policy. But, of course, we keep that always under review.   Have you scheduled such calls for next Friday?  It’s important, our standing approach right now is to continue those calls. So, the concept of doing it, yes, but the practice is to schedule these calls in the afternoon, in between the press release at 13:45 and the press conference, to schedule calls for later the day.   During this pandemic, much of the economy is sustained by governments and they are taking on a lot more debt. However, in a world of persistently low interest rates, perhaps our understanding of debt should be recalibrated. The Maastricht criteria appear to be outdated. Do you think that in a world of low interest rates, low natural rates, we should think about debt differently than 10 or 20 years ago?  There’s a range of different elements to what you say. There is the European fiscal framework, which is under review. With so many countries away from the 60% debt limit under Maastricht, it’s important that this practical issue is considered in the context of the fiscal framework. Let me emphasise two points. One is that this pandemic has shown the value of having fiscal space. The ability to have a big surge in public debt in a short period of time is more possible if your public debt level returns to a lower level outside the emergency situation. That is an important message. If you want to be able to have a forceful fiscal response, because who knows about future tail shocks like this one, it’s important to recognise that having a bit of spare capacity in fiscal policy is important. That will indicate that it’s important post-pandemic to find a strategy to bring down the debt level.  On the other hand, it’s inescapable that there’s a degree of uncertainty about the real rate, but there are many forces which say that the real rate is structurally lower now than 15 years ago or 30 years ago. Back then, that safe level of public debt could be different.  My third point, which I try to make all the time, is that you have to interpret public debt in the context of the wider economy. This is unlike some classic cycles in the past, where the public debt was the mirror image of a large external debt. By and large, what’s happening now is that there’s no European country running large current account deficits. The macroeconomic effect of high public debt is very different when it’s balanced by high household savings, most directly, compared with accumulating net external debt to foreign investors. So the macroeconomics of debt sustainability is quite different in the situation we have now compared with some of those historical, classic vulnerability cases.   Your debt purchases provided a sort of crutch for governments, who are spending through the pandemic. You are providing a similar type of crutch to the banking sector through your TLTROs – ultra-cheap refinancing operations. However, unlike in the case of the asset purchases, you haven’t made a commitment to keep these going for an extended period of time. Do you think that you will need to do something similar for banks? Is there a need to provide greater guidance on TLTROs or make this facility more permanent?  Everything we’re doing right now is about the pandemic period. It wouldn’t make sense for it to be permanent, in the sense that it’s truly always there, at least in terms of the conditions we have now, which are very supportive of bank lending. But this goes back to the phrasing we used in the October statement, which is we are here to ensure and to preserve the currently favourable financing conditions. Very importantly, that includes the financing conditions that confront small firms that confront households, i.e. the conditions they have available from banks. The bank credit channel is very important in terms of overall financing conditions. Of course, in terms of thinking about recalibration, that discussion will also be about recalibrating the TLTROs as appropriate.   "
2020-12-01,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow, Carolynn Look and Alexander Weber on 30 November 2020","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow, Carolynn Look and Alexander Weber on 30 November 2020 1 December 2020  ECB staff are currently working on new projections. From today’s perspective, what do you expect them to show, and how much of an impact will the vaccine have on the economic outlook?  At the moment we’re seeing two countervailing forces. On the one hand, there are rising infection numbers and renewed lockdowns. This has tilted our outlook to the downside. On the other hand, there’s positive news on the vaccine. This shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel. But of course, we still have to get through the tunnel, so that’s the challenge we’re facing. If we look at the data, we have seen a surprisingly strong rebound in the third quarter, but we also see now that the fourth quarter is very likely to show a drop in GDP, even if the situation is not as severe as in the spring. It seems likely that this weakening is going to stretch into the next year, and also that the inflation outlook may be subdued for some time. We continue to work with scenarios, and one of the main driving factors is how quickly the medical solution will come about. It’s likely that the overall recovery will be bumpy. We may see renewed lookdowns until widespread immunity has been achieved.  What does this mean for policy in December? We’ve seen the message being muddied in the past days. You’ve put a big focus on duration in the past weeks that has kept expectation for a bigger boost at bay. What are we to expect? A grand package or more of a measured approach?  That has to be decided by the Governing Council. It’s important to acknowledge that we have already achieved quite a lot. Financing conditions are historically low. This provides substantial support to the economy. We should now focus on preserving these favourable financing conditions for as long as necessary in order to support the recovery, reduce the potential scarring effects and counter the negative impact of the pandemic on the inflation outlook. Given the high degree of uncertainty we’re still facing in the economy and the already very favourable financing conditions, I think it is appropriate to focus on preserving these conditions rather than easing much further. Duration is the crucial aspect. Markets, firms and households need to understand that we will be there for as long as necessary. This is the key part in my view.  How will you determine the right level of financing conditions? Are you saying that bond yields right where they are now is the right level?  This would have to be discussed. Current levels provide substantial support to the economy.  There are various ways of achieving that. The most explicit way is yield curve controls, which the ECB has rejected up until now. Is that something that you could be explicit about?  We have never discussed yield curve control in the Governing Council since I've been here. That doesn’t mean that we’re not going to discuss it at some point in the future, but I don’t think that explicit yield curve control with quantitative targets is on the table at the moment.  How is targeting a spread or a level of financing conditions any different?  With yield curve control, a central bank commits explicitly to keeping yields at a specified level. Then it does whatever it takes to keep the yield at this level. This is a very explicit commitment. Preserving financial conditions is a somewhat broader concept.  What’s always on the top of our minds is our main goal: the inflation objective. This plays the dominant role in our deliberations. Where we do have some flexibility is the time horizon over which we get back to the inflation aim. The optimal horizon depends on the circumstances and the types of shocks we are facing. In a situation like today where – already before the pandemic – the economy had been hit by long-lasting structural shocks that continue to have a disinflationary impact, it may take longer to achieve our aim. This is not about complacency. We’re fully committed to that aim but the lags in monetary policy transmission vary with the state of the economy.  Inflation expectations as measured by financial markets have been stable since August between 1% and 1.2%. That’s too low but at least stable. Are you happy with inflation expectations at this level until the pandemic is over?  We are not happy with that level of inflation expectations. This should be absolutely clear. We would be very happy to see market expectations rise. But it’s not only about market-based inflation expectations. Other types of inflation expectations also matter: what do firms and households expect? These expectations are often very different from what we are seeing in markets. This is one important issue that we’re going to discuss in the strategy review.  The market is looking for around about 500 billion euros more of PEPP, plus more TLTROs with potentially looser conditions. Do you feel that’s what you have to do because the market expects it?  We do not feel obliged to do what the market expects from us. We are guided by our mandate. There are a number of important parameters that we can change. It’s not just the amount, it’s also the duration. And it’s about communication. What’s clear is that since the beginning of the pandemic, the PEPP and the TLTROs have proven highly effective. Therefore, these are likely to be the main instruments for our recalibration.   Are you comfortable with expectations for an increase in PEPP purchases of 500 billion euros and extension by six months?  The expectations are there. We have to take our decision in line with what we think is appropriate, and this is what we’re going to do. If it’s necessary to do something that does not meet market expectations, we have to do that nevertheless. We always stress that our decisions are data-driven and an important input to the decision-making process, our projections, are still being finalised.  You emphasised the point of duration. If there were a proposal that instead of increasing the PEPP for six months, that you were to extend it for 12, is that something that you personally would support?  We will look at all options.  The PEPP is set to run as long as inflation has resumed its pre-pandemic path. But since the financial crisis, we haven’t really seen that recovery in inflation that was expected. What convinces you that bond purchases are the right tool to make that happen this time?   Whenever we are calibrating our instruments, we do a lot of analysis to find out how effective they are. If we look at the joint effect of the asset purchases and TLTROs since March, our calculations show that they are expected to have a cumulative effect on inflation of 0.8 percentage points and on growth of 1.3 percentage points between 2020 and 2022. This is a substantial effect, and therefore, we are confident that these instruments actually worked well in the past. What we have to assess now is whether we expect the same to be true for the future. One has to acknowledge that the situation now is different from the situation we were facing in March. In March we were facing severe market turbulence. At the moment, fortunately, markets are very calm. Therefore, it’s less about market stabilisation and much more about the stance function of these instruments. On the question of how can we get back to the pre-pandemic path, the longer the pandemic lasts, the more blurred this concept becomes. In the end we will have to get back to our inflation aim.  Are interest rate cuts off the table for December?  We have always said we will consider all instruments, and we will do a cost-benefit analysis of all the available instruments and possibly new ones. We are looking at the effectiveness of the instruments, potential side effects, complementarities between instruments and so on. So far in the pandemic, the combination of the PEPP and TLTROs has worked very well. In the past we decided against further interest rate cuts. That doesn’t mean that we won’t cut interest rates in the future if there are changes in our assessment that justify such a step.  You have several hundred billion euros left under PEPP. If you were to do the analysis independently of what the market expects, would you come to the conclusion that you actually need an increase in PEPP now, or could you ramp up purchases later if necessary? Do you feel like you have to come up with an increase to satisfy expectations?  If you think about our previous decision, it was taken at a time when there was no second wave yet. Now we’re experiencing a second wave in Europe and other parts of the world. This seems to suggest that, even with news of the vaccine creating a lot of hope, the pandemic will be more protracted. I think this has to be reflected in our policy decisions. For the previous decision, we had assumed that the pandemic period would extend until June 2021. Now this may appear too optimistic. In fact, we have to distinguish between the health crisis and the economic crisis. A fairly positive scenario could be that by the middle of next year we are seeing the start of widespread immunity and we’ve managed the health crisis. But the economic crisis will take longer than the health crisis. There will be economic ramifications even once the health crisis has been overcome. What matters for our monetary policy decisions are mostly the economic effects.   The PEPP is explicitly slated to run until the crisis phase is over. Which yardstick would you use to define the crisis phase, and how long do you think it will last?  We have not defined any quantitative criterion for the length of the pandemic crisis phase. At this stage, it’s impossible to say when it will be over. Therefore, we’re taking a step-by-step approach. If we now come to the conclusion that June was too optimistic, then this would lead to a prolongation of the pandemic crisis phase, without necessarily linking that assessment explicitly to a quantitative criterion.  At some point, of course, we’ll have to ask ourselves whether the very long-lasting effects are still part of the pandemic crisis phase. At some point there has to be a transition from the crisis phase to a more normal situation, even though there may be scarring in the economy. When defining the pandemic crisis phase, you cannot include all scarring effects that may occur, because they may last very long. My hope would be that if the vaccine can be rolled out relatively quickly then maybe also the scarring effects can be limited. But this is something that we don’t know yet. The balance sheets of firms are now more fragile than they were in the first wave and that may mean that the scarring effects may be more important.  The Governing Council has said that, for the PEPP, the ECB will reinvest the bonds until the end of 2022. But right now we're talking about an extension, and when that time comes, this portfolio will be very large. When do you need to start talking about the longer-term plans for reinvestment and what happens after 2022?  In principle it can be done at any time before the end of the reinvestment period. We have to monitor how the crisis evolves and, in response to that, all the parameters of the purchase programmes can be adjusted.  We’ve talked a lot about the PEPP in addressing all of those issues, but you also mentioned TLTROs as an important part of the package. At the moment the effective interest rate on the TLTRO is minus 1%. Do you think the ECB has reached a lower bound there or is there more leeway?   I don’t think that minus 1% constitutes a lower bound; there’s no technical reason why this could not be lowered further. The question is whether this is considered appropriate. Right now the TLTROs are highly favourable. If we come to the conclusion that the pandemic crisis phase takes longer than originally thought, this could also have an impact on the calibration of the TLTROs. The TLTROs are an important part of our toolkit because they are protecting the bank lending channel, which in our bank-based economy plays a very important role. The targeted character refers to the fact that the extremely favourable rate is linked to a particular lending threshold. This has worked very well in the past and it may also work well in the future.  Are you saying TLTROs are more or less generous enough, and the interest rate can but doesn't necessarily have to be lowered, but we need them for longer?  This is something which will have to be discussed in the light of the projections. What I said is that the duration of our main tools should be linked to the duration of the pandemic crisis phase, and this would refer both to the asset purchases and to the TLTROs. There are many parameters that could be adjusted: there’s the duration of the operation, there is the period of the reduced rate, and also the number of operations.   How about increasing the maturity of TLTROs to five years or something like that?   I don’t think that’s the key point. Three years is already quite long.   In one of your last speeches you talked about financial stability risks related to too much stimulus, and you’re talking a lot about duration now. Central bankers always say they can do more if needed, but given the constraints we see, does the ECB actually have the means to meaningfully bolster inflation and bring it back to its target, or is preserving conditions actually the best you can do at the moment?  Preserving financial conditions is what we should do at the moment. There is always an assessment of the benefits and the costs, and there are many things that enter such assessments. What we can steer most effectively are financial conditions. The question is how changes in financial conditions translate into real economic activity. Let’s say we are in an environment of very high uncertainty – then, the same change in financial conditions may have a smaller impact on real activity than at a time when uncertainty is smaller. Potential side effects also enter the cost-benefit assessment. And then you have different parameters. One can adjust the intensity of the measures, but one can also adjust the horizon. The “medium term” is not a fixed concept, it can be adjusted, and then the question is what the appropriate length of the medium term is in specific circumstances.  In the second quarter, household saving rates reached record levels. Based on what happened in the third quarter and now the second wave of infections, do you think savings will fuel the recovery next year or is there any reason to assume the dynamic will be different this time?   There will be a certain degree of pent-up demand. This will support the recovery. But we also know that the sector most severely hit by the pandemic, the services sector, is probably the one that’s going to benefit least from that, because there’s a limit to how often we can go to the restaurant, the hairdresser, go on vacation and so on. It’s a major theme of this pandemic that its economic effects are so uneven, that it affects different sectors and therefore also different countries to very different degrees – and of course different people. There’s the fear that this pandemic will lead to higher inequality.  During this crisis the ECB got a lot of help from the fiscal policy side, and President Lagarde mentioned today how much of a game changer the EU’s recovery fund is. It’s now being held up in a pretty fundamental debate over the rule of law. What does it mean for the ECB if the plan isn’t finalised?  In this crisis, monetary and fiscal policy have acted in a complementary way, as they should, and thereby they have reinforced each other. That was very beneficial and it’s pretty clear that this should continue for quite some time. So neither the fiscal support nor the monetary support should be withdrawn prematurely. The European fiscal response was a game changer. We had a strong national response already, but then on top we had the European response, which also had a signalling effect by showing that Europe can act together when it’s needed. When it comes to the conclusion of the negotiations about the Next Generation EU instrument, it’s absolutely crucial that they are concluded as soon as possible. But I am optimistic that an agreement can be found.  We’re looking at more monetary stimulus for a very long time. Has the ECB succumbed to fiscal dominance?  I do not think there is a problem of fiscal dominance at the current juncture. There is really no alternative to the rising public debt levels that we are seeing, because at this stage fiscal policy is clearly the main stabilisation instrument. It’s also likely to be highly effective, because we know that when monetary policy gets closer to the effective lower bound, fiscal policy becomes more effective. What is absolutely crucial for the development of the euro area economy over the coming years is how public funds are employed in the end. It makes a huge difference whether these funds are used for productive investments, like the green transition, digitalisation, education and infrastructure, or not. It has an impact on monetary policy, too, because a good use of investments may also give a boost to the real natural rate of interest by increasing productivity, which would give monetary policy more space. It also matters greatly for future debt dynamics, because those will hinge on growth in the euro area, and that depends on fiscal policy allocating these funds in a sensible way.   We all know what a debt crisis looks like in Europe. And there will come a point when the euro area economy will improve, when inflation will pick up and when we will look at an Italy with a debt-to-GDP ratio of at least twice if not more the level allowed under Maastricht. Are you willing to say the ECB will tighten policy if the euro area as a whole demands it, knowing that countries like Italy and Greece will have a problem with that?  Interest rates are extremely low at the moment and so the debt-to-GDP ratio may not be the only metric to look at. What really matters is the debt service as well as economic growth. We have also seen that the maturities of government debt have lengthened, which partly protects governments against increasing interest rates. In any case, an increase in the interest rate will never affect all debt at once but only a portion of the overall government debt. We have an inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%, but we already now stress in our introductory statements that there is a commitment to symmetry. And that means it will not happen that once the inflation rate crosses a certain threshold we will immediately fight against the increase in inflation. We have always stressed that what we would need to see is a sustained increase in inflation. And if you see such a sustained increase in inflation, it’s likely that this reflects an overall more robust economy, at least if the shocks are coming from the demand side. With supply-side shocks it’s a bit more difficult. But then again, we have the “medium term” concept, which helps us to deal with supply-side shocks.  It’s quite hard to know what’s going to happen in the future, but at the moment, we seem to be on track towards a vaccine and the ECB’s assumption of a medical solution in the middle of next year, and in a year’s time, hopefully the pandemic is over. Do you think it’s likely that this meeting in December is the ECB’s last big push and after that it’s just managing the crisis and eventually coming out of it?  That would be good news. I indeed hope this will be the last big push, but we can never know what’s going to happen. There is a positive scenario where we get a swift recovery and the scarring is relatively limited. But there is also the risk of the crisis being more protracted. In any case, we know there will be structural changes. Not all of those structural changes are bad news, but a structural change always creates disruption, especially for labour markets, so it’s very hard to predict.  Mario Draghi never raised interest rates in his entire term. Do you think you’ll ever see policy tightened while you’re on the board?  I’m not good at predicting that. But I would hope that at some point this will be possible. We shouldn’t take for granted that interest rates will remain low forever. There is no law of nature that tells us interest rates have to stay low for the next decades, and if we look at economic history, we see that there were different periods and people often thought they would last for a long time, but they came to an end at some point. This may also happen this time, but it’s of course hard to predict. Within our projection horizon, it’s hard to see that, but my term is longer than our projection horizon. So there is some hope.  Let us talk now about climate change policies. It seems that disclosure requirements for bond issuers and credit ratings that include climate risks have emerged as the two main instruments through which you want to address climate risks and green monetary policy. What’s the timeframe in which this is realistic?  No decision has been taken on this. The proposals you mention seem quite plausible, but it has never been discussed in the Governing Council. In the monetary policy strategy review we will seriously consider this topic. But of course this will be a longer-term project because it has so many facets. It concerns our whole model apparatus, where we plan to include climate risk. Then there is the question of how we assess climate risk on the balance sheets of firms and banks, what this implies for financial stability and so on. Each of them is a big project. Another big topic is how climate change can influence our monetary policy operations. Disclosure is attractive because there the central banks can play an important catalyst role. Whatever we want to do to deal with climate change – and not just us but also other market players – relies on data. For that we need two things. First, we need a taxonomy, that is a classification of what is green and what is less green. Second, we need a disclosure of the information by the firms to be able to judge how green some activity is. This information has to be available first. It’s a prerequisite for everything else that can come later.  We’re having a very big debate about climate change and what central banks can do and you’re telling us that the Governing Council has not addressed this once?   This is going to be discussed in the context of the monetary policy strategy review. The strategy review is a broad-based process. A lot of analytical work is going on in the background, with many papers being written, analyses being done, data being collected and so on. And then the Governing Council discussion is the end of that rigorous process.   Should it be?   It’s a very well-established procedure that we first conduct the analysis and then we have the discussion. This is what is done with all the other topics as well. The difference is that with respect to climate change, there exists less work that we can draw from than for, say, the price stability objective or fiscal policy, which have been discussed for decades. This is why this topic is more demanding and it’s perfectly clear that central banks will have to put much more resources into this area in the future. In the past, the topic was more or less non-existent, so this is something that has to be built up, also the intellectual capacity has to be a built up. There are by now quite a few people working on this topic. It’s a structured process but it takes some time.   There are a couple of banks, JP Morgan among them, who predict that 2021 will be the first year when more ESG bonds will be sold in dollars than in euros. Do you expect the U.S. to surpass the EU in issuing that kind of debt?   It would be excellent news if more green bonds were issued in US dollars as well. One of the hopes that people attach to the incoming US President is that he’s going to put more emphasis on the green transition and that of course also requires the greening of the capital market. It would be more than welcome if the US capital markets also became greener. Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global response. The European capital market should seize the opportunity and expand its position further. In Europe, the project of the capital markets union should be combined with the greening of the capital markets because the two naturally go together and this could help to develop and maintain a strong position.  Do you expect the green premium in bond markets to continue next year?  That’s an open issue. We still have very little research on that. We have to see how that market develops. We will certainly see a lot of progress in this whole market segment with much better classifications and ratings. At the moment, ESG ratings are still not as reliable as they should be. They are sending diverging signals, depending on which data provider you consider, and therefore also the market pricing may change when this market matures and the information basis becomes better.

2020-11-30,Christine Lagarde,The future of money – innovating while retaining trust,"Article by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, in <em>L’ENA hors les murs</em> magazine","   INTERVIEW  The future of money – innovating while retaining trust   Article by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, in L’ENA hors les murs magazine Paris, 30 November 2020  Important lessons can be drawn from the past to understand the factors influencing the journey towards the future of money, including the possible introduction of a digital euro. Ensuring the euro meets the needs of European citizens is at the core of the ECB’s mandate.  Throughout history, the nature of money has evolved in response to socioeconomic changes. But the functions of money – as a means of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value – have remained the same for centuries.  One reason why money first emerged was to overcome the limitations and inefficiencies of bartering. As economies became more specialised, trade became all the more essential, and a universal medium of exchange was needed to facilitate it. Coins made from (precious) metals fulfilled that purpose for centuries.  But with the development of international trade, coins became increasingly impractical because they are difficult to store and transport in large volumes.  This led to the next phase in the evolution of money through medieval times into the late middle ages and early modern times. Developments included the advent of Templar’s credit notes in France, private giro banking in Italy, bills of exchange and promissory notes, and the first predecessors of paper money.   Role of the public sector  All of these instruments foresaw convertibility into precious metal coins. The acceptance of these forms of dematerialised and easy-to-carry money depended on the reputation of the issuer, and credit risk became relevant.  This led to the public sector playing an increasingly important role in issuing money and ensuring its value remained stable. Examples include the emergence of early public giro banks at the beginning of the 15th century and the first attempts to issue modern banknotes in the second half of the 17th century.[1]  In today’s modern economies, including in the euro area, money is no longer convertible into, or backed by, any commodity. Fiat money, as it is known, serves as legal tender by decree of the government or even constitutional legislation (such as the EU Treaty[2]). The value of money is based on citizens’ trust in it being generally accepted for all forms of economic exchange and in the ability of central banks to maintain its purchasing power through monetary policy. Central banks’ institutional independence also bolsters their ability to maintain trust in money. Since early modern times central banks have gradually been assuming an increasingly pivotal role in ensuring that money delivers on the three functions I outlined. They must be fully aware of and adapt to changing realities.  Technological progress  As we enter the digital age, the nature of money, but also of goods and services, is changing quickly. Digitalisation and technological advances are transforming all areas of society, accelerating the process of dematerialisation.  Non-cash payments continue to increase. In the euro area, over the last year the total number increased by 8.1% to 98 billion. Nearly half of these transactions were made by card, followed by credit transfers and direct debits.[3]  The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated this trend towards digitalisation, with a surge in online payments and a shift towards contactless payments in shops.[4] Market participants expect payments to be the financial service that will be most affected by technological innovation and competition over the next five years, according to a survey conducted in 2019.[5]  To meet the demand for digital means of payment, new forms of private money (i.e. a liability of private entities) have emerged. They are available as commercial bank deposits which can be used for transfers and direct debits, and as electronic money through credit cards and mobile payment apps. In the euro area, the Eurosystem’s supervision mechanisms ensure commercial banks and payment service providers are effective and safe. This enables people to continue to have confidence in private money, which remains an integral part of our financial system.  But central bank money in digital form is still not available for retail payments.  Digital euro  The ECB wants to ensure the euro remains fit for the digital era. Early this year, the Governing Council decided to explore the possibility of issuing of a digital euro – digital central bank money for retail payments, in other words.  The Eurosystem is assessing the implications of the potential introduction of a digital euro, which in legal terms would be a liability of the central bank. In October the ECB published the Report on a digital euro[6] and launched a public consultation[7].  But why issue a digital euro, if other forms of (private) digital money are already available? Central bank money is unique. It provides people with unrestricted access to a simple, essentially risk-free and trusted means of payment they can use for any basic transaction. But for retail use it is currently only offered physically in the form of cash. A digital euro would complement cash and ensure that consumers continue to have unrestricted access to central bank money in a form that meets their evolving digital payment needs.  It could be important in a range of future scenarios, from a decline in the use of cash to pre-empting the uptake of foreign digital currencies in the euro area. Issuing a digital euro might become necessary to ensure both continued access to central bank money and monetary sovereignty. A properly designed digital euro would create synergies with the payments industry and enable the private sector to build new businesses based on digital euro-related services.  A digital euro would also be an emblem of the ongoing process of European integration and ultimately help to unify Europe’s digital economies.  Crypto-assets pose risks  But what about bitcoin or other crypto-assets that have been trying to gain a foothold in the digital payments space and to anchor trust in their technology?  Innovations like distributed ledger technology (DLT), in particular blockchain (which is at the core of crypto-assets such as bitcoin), bring both new opportunities and new risks.  Transactions between peers occur directly, with no need for a trusted third-party intermediary. The trust that is usually inherent in a transaction is replaced by cryptographic proofs and the security and integrity of records is ensured by DLT, which avoids the “double-spending” problem. Nevertheless, trust is not entirely dispensable.  The main risk lies in relying purely on technology and the flawed concept of there being no identifiable issuer or claim. This also means that users cannot rely on crypto-assets maintaining a stable value: they are highly volatile, illiquid and speculative, and so do not fulfil all the functions of money.[8]  Recently, we have seen the emergence of stablecoins, which try to solve crypto-assets’ problem of a lack of stability and trust by pegging their assets to stable and trusted fiat money issued by States.[9] And the issuers of “global” stablecoins, which target a global footprint, further aim to introduce their own payment schemes and clearing and settlement arrangements.[10]  Although stablecoins could drive additional innovation in payments and be well integrated into social media, trade and other platforms, they pose serious risks.  If widely adopted, they could threaten financial stability and monetary sovereignty. For instance, if the issuer cannot guarantee a fixed value or if they are perceived as being incapable of absorbing losses, a run could occur. Additionally, using stablecoins as a store of value could trigger a large shift of bank deposits to stablecoins, which may have an impact on banks’ operations and the transmission of monetary policy.[11]  Stablecoins, particularly those backed by global technology firms (the “big techs”), could also present risks to competitiveness and technological autonomy in Europe, as they would attempt to leverage their competitive advantage and control of large platforms. Their dominant positions may harm competition and consumer choice, and raise concerns over data privacy and the misuse of personal information.[12]   “Money is memory”  In general, end users prioritise ease of use and smooth integration with other apps or services, and therefore welcome new solutions in exchange for providing their personal data. Public authorities are open to innovation and are prepared to act as catalysts for change, while implementing appropriate policy measures to ensure this innovation helps consumers rather than hindering them.  Payment providers and their payment solutions must be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight – in accordance with the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules” – to protect users and safeguard the stability of the economy against new risks that even go beyond financial ones.  Some say that “money is memory”[13], and it seems that this memory is becoming increasingly digital. But consumers’ digital data and records must not be misused. The abuse of personal information for commercial or other purposes could endanger privacy and harm competition. These and other potential risks are being assessed by the Eurosystem and European institutions.  At the same time, public authorities must balance the benefits and risks of innovation in payments and be prepared to take a leading role in ensuring that payments remain efficient, safe and inclusive in the digital age.  As the economy continues to evolve and new expectations about the nature of money emerge, the Eurosystem must be ready to respond and ensure that European payments adapt to changing consumer preferences and remain inclusive and efficient.  Despite all the changes I have mentioned, the foundations of money remain intact. People accept money only if it is highly trusted, maintains its value and respects privacy – an aspect that is becoming increasingly important in the digital age. These foundations have been and will continue to be found in central bank money, irrespective of the form it takes in the future.     Bindseil, U.

2020-11-28,Yves Mersch,Interview with Le Monde,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel and Eric Albert","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Monde   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel and Eric Albert 28 November 2020  How do you feel about the euro today compared with your hopes and expectations at the time of negotiating the Maastricht Treaty?  At the time, it was a leap into the unknown. The international financial markets were sceptical. And we didn’t know whether citizens would embrace the new currency. Today, I am very satisfied with the outcome. First of all, the euro has won the wholehearted approval of more than 75% of Europe’s citizens. And even the most eurosceptic of political parties have changed their opinion on this given that Europe’s citizens do not want to “undo” what has already been accomplished. What’s more, it’s a currency valued by the corporate sector and sought after by the financial markets. Only a few years ago, there were still concerns that the euro area might fall apart. The political response to the crisis and the steps taken by the European Central Bank quelled those concerns. Today, the differences in interest rates across countries, across firms in those countries, have been reduced. And there is heightened demand on the part of international investors for euro-denominated assets, even though we do not have the same financial market depth as other countries, such as the United States.  There is still scepticism surrounding the euro. Are you at all concerned by the mistrust of Monetary Union voiced in Italy at the start of the pandemic, or in Greece during the 2012-15 crisis?  It is always easier to blame Europe for what’s not working and attribute success to national policies, and that can fan the flames of this mistrust. In spite of all that, public support for the euro is strong. In some Member States, it is even close to 90%. We shouldn’t forget about the permanent transfers that flow within the EU from its more developed to its less developed members. If the latter were not in the euro area, their debt would undoubtedly not be financed at such low interest rates. Leaving the euro area would increase their debt servicing costs through interest rate levels and devaluations, which would mean less money for investment, research and education. And by the way, we can also ponder whether or not the younger Member States would remain intact if they left the single currency and the EU.   The euro nevertheless went through a major crisis between 2010 and 2015, which led to huge social upheaval…  The initial agreement was that we would have a single currency, but that fiscal, economic and structural policies would be kept at national level. We were aware that it was a source of tension, which still exists today. But we learned lessons from the last financial crisis. The response to the pandemic has led to much closer coordination, as it happens, between monetary policy and national fiscal policies. And the Stability and Growth Pact (which caps the budget deficit at 3% of GDP) has even been temporarily put on hold.  The EU has also reached an agreement on a €750 billion recovery package. Talks to finalise the package are ongoing. Is this a “Hamiltonian moment” for the EU in terms of taking a step closer towards federalism?  It is a very important step. Europe has shown that it is still capable of employing its political capital to respond with solidarity. This has had a considerable impact on non-European investor confidence. But the European recovery package is temporary in nature, for use only in response to the pandemic. To say that it marks the beginning of the “United States of Europe” is going a bit far. The situation is very different from when Alexander Hamilton advocated for US federalism in the 18th century in the wake of the civil war. At that time, there was a very clear financial benefit to consolidating the debt of the southern states funded by their northern counterparts.  From an economic perspective, has Europe fallen behind the United States since the 2008 crisis?  We can make up the ground that we have lost. The gap has come about due to structural factors. There are strong trends such as demographic change (moving at a faster pace in the United States) behind the difference in per capita GDP. There is also the proportion of funding to the economy provided by banks in Europe. When a banking crisis occurs in an already weakened sector, it has a knock-on effect on the entire economy, and the recovery takes even longer. We have learned from this, which is why we set up the banking union and insisted on the need for a capital markets union. Moreover, European fiscal policies have been excessively procyclical. As a result, countries that built up their reserves are currently in a much better financial position to deal with the pandemic crisis, whereas those with the highest levels of debt know that there are limits to the action they can take. There is also the issue of private debt. At the beginning, it was higher in the United States, but it has been brought down much faster there than in Europe. Last of all, Europe needs to implement structural reform at national level. Recommendations have been made, but they haven’t resulted in action being taken. The same goes for the Stability and Growth Pact: the rules are not being complied with. To me, there is a significant lack of governance which needs to be fixed. To be master of its own destiny and compete with the United States, Europe needs to solve its structural weaknesses.   Since the euro area was created, it has remained an unfinished project, edging slowly towards completion, and only during times of crisis. Do you know why?   The differences across the economic, financial and political cycles, which are never aligned in the various Member States, are holding back progress. This poses a challenge to the task of building Europe, which, as Jean Monnet pointed out, only picks up speed in times of crisis. But once you’ve been working this way for 30 years, it becomes second nature! It is difficult to avoid these delays and complexities when you embark upon a project as colossal as building the European Union in peacetime. Similar projects in other countries have often been the result of civil wars.  In the long run, will the EU Treaties need to be amended?  We can already implement significant reforms without changing any Treaty, such as creating the capital markets union a must for us or completing banking union. Reform in other areas will be more challenging. Transferring some powers that have remained at the national level up until now, such as budgetary authority, or taxation – still subject to the unanimity rule – will thus be very difficult to do without transferring a degree of national democratic representation – sovereignty – to the European level. The issuance of common European debt is a sign of significant progress, but common budgetary capacity or a European budget worthy of the name are still a long way off. Currently, the European Parliament is above all else responsible for expenditure, but very little revenue: the system is therefore flawed. During the discussions held prior to the Maastricht Treaty, we were convinced that the single currency would act as a catalyst for European integration. We were hopeful that the markets would push in that direction. But in this respect, they have at the very least…been slow to respond.   Many people today are calling for a review of the Stability and Growth Pact at the very least – the target of 3% of GDP for the budget deficit and of 60% of GDP for debt – a target with which Member States are no longer able to comply. Should the Maastricht rules be reviewed? If so, in what way?   The less we have complied with these rules, the more complex and confusing they have become for the general public, which is not very democratic. However, it is true that they are a reflection of the situation in the 1990s when inflation and growth hovered around 2%. We can simplify and revise them to take into account the effects of globalisation, demographic change, and the fall in the equilibrium interest rate. But it is also worth noting that there is currently a debate in Germany to bring the budget deficit to below the 3% mark in 2022 or 2023. At the end of the day, compliance with the rules has nothing to do with the economy. It is more a matter of political science and law. Abolishing the Maastricht rules will not improve the functioning of our economies. For that to happen, we need to improve our capacity for growth, and therefore implement structural reforms.  By aiming to comply with these fiscal rules at all costs, isn’t there a risk that we may make the same mistake we made in 2010 by reintroducing austerity policies too early?  Making public spending more efficient is not the same as austerity. The temporary budgetary support measures are not sustainable if there is no recovery in activity levels. From the outset, the Stability and Growth Pact required a balanced budget. Is that a bad thing? We need to find a common response to this issue. If it is the norm to have a budget deficit of, let’s say, 5% of GDP, this means that national as well as international investors need to be found to finance it. International investors like policies that are predictable, robust and sustainable over the long term. We have the benefit of a stable currency that has the backing of our citizens. This should not be undermined by an unsustainable fiscal policy.   Over the next few years, what changes would you like to see within the EU?  Structurally, we need to continue with our efforts in education and research which are crucial for our future. But we also need to provide a more tangible response to the issues that are of major concern to our fellow citizens. How will Europe deal with matters of internal and external security? How will it deal with healthcare? Are we convinced that the response to the pandemic should be purely domestic, as should the response to terrorism? The problem is that as the Treaties currently stand, we cannot respond at the European level.  You have attended more than 500 Governing Council meetings. Do you have any regrets or are there any particular success stories that come to mind?  Before joining the ECB, I also attended several hundred ECOFIN meetings and around a hundred EU Council meetings. Europe is part of who I am, so please forgive me. The success stories are always collective, never individual. At the ECB, a young institution, we have always favoured a more federal-style and consensus-based decision-making process. It works very well. And it also makes it possible to overcome the all-too-often intergovernmental approach to European decision-making.   "
2020-11-28,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Helsingin Sanomat,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Petri Sajari on 24 November 2020","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Helsingin Sanomat   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Petri Sajari on 24 November 2020 28 November 2020  What are the key risks for the euro area recovery at the moment?  The fourth quarter of 2020 will be marked by the measures taken by euro area governments to deal with the new wave of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections that started after the summer. While these containment measures are generally not on the same scale as those taken in March or April, they will have an impact on the economy. We had a welcome surprise in the third quarter, but our quarter-on-quarter growth projection for the fourth, which was slightly above 3%, will not be met. Looking at leading indicators such as the purchasing managers’ index, negative quarter-on-quarter growth is now the most realistic scenario for the end of the year. The main issue in the near future will be the availability of the vaccine and the precise details of how and when it is to be rolled out. The news is having a positive impact on market sentiment, but the implementation of the vaccine warrants our attention. Hopefully, a very high percentage of the population will soon be vaccinated and the nightmare of this pandemic will begin to draw to a close.  According to the International Monetary Fund, the pandemic will have the largest impact on the eurozone economy. What do you think the long-term damage of this crisis will be?   There are indeed factors that cause concern. The first long-term consequence of the pandemic is that public debt-to-GDP ratios will increase by between 15 and 20 percentage points. Similarly, leverage in the private, mainly corporate, sector will also increase. And there is a risk, which we need to avoid, of long-term scars in the labour market. Currently we see a decoupling between the drop in economic activity and the evolution of the labour market, i.e. unemployment levels have not risen by as much as you would expect with such a deep decline in activity. This is because the temporary work schemes implemented by governments across Europe are avoiding a sharp increase in unemployment. We believe the economy will start to recover in 2021 and continue its revival in 2022. It will be essential that those who are currently on furlough schemes continue to belong to the labour force, and that those who have lost their jobs can rejoin the labour market. We can then not only recover the level of economic activity we had before the pandemic, but also the level of employment.   If the crisis gets worse, which now seems inevitable, what more will the ECB be able to do?   As I’ve mentioned, the fourth quarter will be worse than forecast, but the medium-term outlook – mainly because of the ray of hope brought by news of the vaccine – looks brighter. However, when we assess our instruments we do not only look at economic output. We also look at the evolution of inflation, which is our primary mandate. Inflation will be negative until the end of the year and we expect that it will turn positive next year because some drivers of this negative inflation will be reverted, for instance the reductions in value added tax or the sharp decline in oil prices caused by the lack of economic activity. All in all, we expect inflation to be close to 1% in 2021 and to see it moving up towards 1.2% or 1.3% in 2022.  As President Lagarde indicated after the last Governing Council meeting, we will recalibrate our instruments in December and this recalibration mainly involves our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO), which is an instrument to inject liquidity into the banking sector, and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which right now comprises an envelope of €1.35 trillion to be implemented until mid-2021.These are the two main tools if the situation gets darker, although the arrival of the vaccines brings hope regarding the medium-term outlook.  Is there a risk that low interest rates, combined with the asset purchase program and the PEPP, are creating zombie companies that would not have survived under normal financial conditions and are therefore an obstacle to creative destruction?  The interest rate environment is not only a consequence of monetary policy decisions. It is also the consequence of a combination of other factors, such as globalisation, digitalisation and demographics. These have made the natural interest rate, which is a real variable rather than a monetary variable, decline over time. This, combined with very low inflation expectations, has created a situation where nominal interest rates, which are the ones we observe in the markets, are very low. But this is not only a result of monetary policy – it also reflects a decline in the natural interest rate. Furthermore, low rates have been very useful in sustaining economic activity. Without them, the process would most likely not just have been one of creative destruction but one of simple destruction of companies and a decline in GDP.   Some might also say that the high debt levels in the economy will lead to zombie banks and zombie companies that constrain growth because of extraordinary debt burdens. What is your assessment of this?  As I mentioned earlier, there will be a legacy of debt after this crisis, in both the public and the private sector, and we will have to take this into consideration. But there is no alternative in the short term. The first line of defence against the consequences of the pandemic has been, and had to be, fiscal policy. The alternative – doing nothing – would have had much worse consequences in the short term and also in the medium and long term.  Regarding private debt, when you experience a decline in revenues as substantial as that experienced by many European companies, you need to try to bridge the gap and survive until the pandemic is over. And to do that you need to take on debt. There’s no alternative. Once the pandemic is over, issues such as fiscal sustainability and private lending will come to the fore, but in the short term there is no alternative.  Let’s move to the banking system. What are the main vulnerabilities in the eurozone banking system?  European banks have more capital and are more liquid and resilient than before the global financial crisis. But their weak point is very low profitability, which is reflected in very low valuations. This is not trivial, as it has an impact on their capacity to raise capital in the markets or generate it organically. It also makes it challenging to achieve an adequate level of provisioning that is in line with developments in the economy. Profitability was already the key weak point before the pandemic, and the crisis has aggravated it. Banks will also suffer a decline in revenues and the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) will go up. We expect the bulk of the NPL wave to come in the first half of next year.  Do you believe there will be consolidation via mergers and acquisitions in the eurozone banking sector?   We have started to see some consolidation, for instance in Italy and Spain. So far it’s domestic consolidation. It would be good if we also saw some cross-border consolidation. Consolidation is not a target in itself, but it could be a way to reduce excess capacity and costs.   The ECB started its asset purchase programme in early 2015 and abandoned it in late 2018. In autumn 2019, it was started again, but inflation remains very low. What are the key factors behind this extraordinarily low inflation?  Both headline and core inflation have been low over the last ten years and, as I mentioned, there are some structural factors, such as digitalisation, globalisation and demographics, that help explain why. In 2015 and 2016, there was a clear risk of deflation and the ECB acted to avoid it and to anchor inflation expectations. It remains to be seen what will happen with some of these factors. For instance, globalisation will likely not be as intense as it has been in recent decades, as the pandemic could make value chains more regional, which might have an impact on inflation. However, according to our projections inflation will remain low, and we will therefore keep monetary policy accommodative so that inflation can converge to our medium term aim.   In July 2020 the European Union introduced a recovery plan worth €750 billion. What is your take on that? Is there a risk that States may use it in a manner that does not promote structural changes?   The Next Generation EU fund is a very positive response, not only because of its size but also because it sends a very clear signal of the common willingness to defend Europe and the euro area. And regarding the funds, indeed, it’s not about spending but about spending properly, through programmes that can transform the European economy and accompany the structural reforms needed to improve productivity and enhance competitiveness. The European Commission will monitor this spending. If this money is not spent properly, we will be missing a great opportunity to make the European economy greener, more digital and more competitive.  Since introducing the PEPP in March, the ECB has definitely been able to calm the markets, but many people might still wonder how the programme has supported the real economy and households. What is your answer?   Calming the situation in the sovereign debt markets also brought reassurance to other markets, which has had a positive impact on the financing conditions that banks offer to their clients, households and companies. By avoiding fragmentation in the sovereign debt markets, we also avoided a credit crunch. Furthermore, PEPP also includes corporate sector purchases such as bonds or commercial paper.  Do you believe the attitude towards public debt has changed for good? Or is this change temporary, based on the fact that extraordinary times require extraordinary actions to support the economy?  Fiscal policy has to be the first line of defence, and fiscal deficits will be the consequence of the measures that governments have taken and will continue to take to address the impact of the pandemic. Public expenditure has to focus on the pandemic, for instance on furlough or public guarantee schemes, healthcare, etc. As a result, we will see larger public debt ratios. But in the medium term, once the pandemic is over, the situation will need to be addressed to ensure the sustainability of public finances.  So, basically, your answer is that you don’t believe that there has been a major shift in attitude towards public debt?  The big change is that the pandemic has caused a public health crisis which demanded a fiscal response. There was no alternative and, in the medium term, we will see higher public debt ratios. We will have to deal with that once the pandemic is over.   The response to this crisis has been quite different from what it was ten years ago, when the eurozone crisis began, because then the constant narrative was that we cannot allow public debt to increase.  This time is different. This crisis hasn’t been triggered by banks or financial stability troubles, as was the case in 2008. This is an exogenous shock of a magnitude we have not seen since the end of the Second World War. The policy response was the only one available: fiscal measures as the first line of defence, accompanied by monetary policy. Not acting rapidly on the fiscal side would have provoked an even deeper decline in GDP, and fiscal policy would also have had to react to that.   "
2020-11-27,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Expresso,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 19 November 2020","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Expresso   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 19 November 2020 27 November 2020  There is a great deal of anticipation on the markets and in general looking ahead to the ECB’s December meeting. What can we expect from it?  We should expect what the President stated very clearly at the last press conference: that the ECB’s Governing Council will reassess the macroeconomic outlook and recalibrate its measures accordingly. The outlook for inflation has clearly deteriorated rather than improved over the past few months owing to the resurgence of the pandemic and the containment measures taken in response. It’s also clear that our stimulus so far has not been sufficient to make progress towards our aim in a sustained way. In spring we reacted quickly and we should do so again. The consensus within the Governing Council is that our instruments need to be recalibrated in December.   When you talk about recalibration, what do you mean exactly? Are you referring to an increase in the rate of monthly asset purchases or the use of new instruments?  This is a collegial decision taken by the Governing Council. But it’s useful to think about our policy in two ways. The euro area has suffered a huge economic shock, with considerable downside risks that have threatened to set self-reinforcing recessionary and deflationary dynamics in motion. Our forceful policy response since March has first of all been designed to stem these downward spirals and allow financial markets and ultimately the economy to withstand the shock, thereby supporting price stability. This will remain the case for as long as necessary. The second element involves calibrating our stance to reflect our commitment to bring inflation back to our aim. We must do this without undue delay, in order to eliminate any possible question marks over our determination to preserve price stability – our primary mandate – and to avoid a disanchoring of inflation expectations: with the second wave, some of the downside risks have materialised and the starting point for the inflation outlook is now lower than a few months ago. In this endeavour we are data-driven: at our last meeting, we decided that it would not be wise to take a decision before understanding the extent of the new containment measures, their impact on the economy and the fiscal measures that governments would take in response.   Does the ECB still have the firepower to deal with this second wave of coronavirus?   Dealing with the second wave is all about the right policy mix. Research shows that when private sector demand is constrained by uncertainty and health restrictions – as is the case today – fiscal policy is key. Favourable financing conditions create the best environment for an effective fiscal policy, which in turn creates the conditions for the private sector to also take full advantage of the favourable financing conditions we ensure through our measures. In other words, fiscal policy in this phase has become an important channel for transmitting our monetary policy impulses and supporting our stabilisation goals. Seen from this perspective, there’s a lot more we can do through a combination of our asset purchase programmes and our measures to support the financing of the real economy through banks and the bond market. And there should be no doubt as to our commitment to bring inflation back to our aim and therefore the continuity of our policies even when the recovery gets underway. We want to see inflation converge towards our aim in a sustained manner and we cannot hesitate in taking decisive measures if we wish to avoid the risk of a downward adjustment in inflation expectations. We have firepower, we have instruments that we can recalibrate, and we’re going to do so.   Are you concerned we might fall back into recession?   I am concerned. There has been some good news, such as the announcement of the possible approval of vaccines by health authorities. In this respect, there is light at the end of the tunnel. But even under the most optimistic scenario, the production, distribution and administration of these vaccines will take time. It may take even longer to reduce the risk and the perception of risk among the population: savings intentions are at a record high, households and businesses are more indebted than one year ago and coronavirus-induced uncertainty has the potential to leave scars even after the economy recovers. In other words, 2021 will still be a “pandemic year”, and we will still have to tread very carefully. We cannot be complacent. We cannot take the risk of adverse interim scenarios and of letting the consequences of the pandemic last longer without introducing additional policy stimulus, otherwise our production capacity will be hollowed out in the process. The recovery would then take even longer and inflation could continue to hover at very low levels.   The markets were ecstatic following the vaccine announcements. Do you feel there has been too much optimism on show?  Financial markets are forward-looking by their very nature. Based on the new information available and their interpretation of it, they take a view on the future trajectory of the economy, corporate earnings and dividends – which by the way reflect assumptions about policy support. But in our role as central bankers, we must be prudent. We need to base our decisions on the various scenarios that could materialise in the absence of our intervention. And we cannot take it for granted that things will go as well as expected by financial markets. We cannot afford to be too optimistic. The risk of adverse scenarios – and the damage they could cause – is simply too great. And even in the optimistic scenario, inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued and to recover very slowly.  Do you think that governments and the European Commission, as well as the ECB, should also be prepared to do more if the crisis persists or is more serious than expected?  Governments are aware of the need to intervene and all the conditions are in place for governments to act. Financing conditions are favourable, we have been clear that we would ensure that they remain favourable, and our forward guidance makes our commitment explicit. Moreover, European authorities have already reacted strongly: the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme will support the recovery and other instruments have already been deployed, such as the European Commission’s instrument to help Member States protect people’s jobs during the pandemic. I have no reason to doubt that additional efforts will be made if necessary. Governments have confirmed this, including those previously reluctant to take part in common responses. We have seen a forceful, timely, European policy reaction to support European people and businesses in response to a common shock. And it is working well.   In some countries, such as Portugal, the fiscal stimulus is relatively limited because of high public debt levels. Do you agree with this more cautious approach or do you think that governments should be more expansionary?   Fiscal policy throughout the euro area has been expansionary, although more so in some countries than in others. Substantial discretionary stimulus measures have been taken across the board. We should not look at these measures on a country-by-country basis as the spillovers from a forceful synchronised and common fiscal response are large. Moreover, the efficacy of fiscal policy – the so-called fiscal multiplier – increases when interest rates are close to their lower bound. And like in the United States, we have seen a decisive, area-wide response in terms of both fiscal policy and monetary policy.   Isn’t there a risk that some countries, such as Portugal, Spain or Italy, will get left behind in the recovery since they have less fiscal space to respond?   We cannot rule out that possibility altogether. But compared to the previous crisis, we have a very different set of solutions in place. Even countries with high debt to GDP ratios, whose response was weaker in the past, can now take advantage of the resources made available at the European level. What is now crucial is that countries use those resources to finance investment and boost their growth potential.  What should Portugal’s priorities be?   Every country has its own challenges. But a number of cross-cutting themes also apply to Portugal. The priority should be investment to facilitate the reallocation of production and jobs to the sectors with the highest growth potential: investing in activities that improve the quality of the environment and the country’s technological and digital infrastructure, activities that create a knowledge-based economy building on human capital and education. These are also the priorities identified by the Next Generation EU programme.   In any event, the debt levels of many countries will hit new highs. David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament, recently spoke about the idea of making the recovery fund permanent, of having European debt and even of debt forgiveness. What do you think of these ideas?  The move towards deeper European integration is highly desirable. It’s a natural development of monetary union. We should bear in mind that, following the approval of the NGEU this summer, euro area countries have taken a big step towards closer fiscal integration. They have also created the legitimate expectation of a common fiscal response when dealing with a common shock in the future. I don’t know how long it will take to make even greater progress. It is my hope that, when we look back in 20 years’ time, we will look upon 2020 as a turning point on the road towards European integration.   Is it possible or even desirable for there to be some form of debt forgiveness via the ECB and its public debt portfolio?  Doing so would contravene the Treaties. And we must remember that all debt is credit. If we cancel a debt, we cancel the corresponding credit and this could have broader, destabilising consequences. Only growth can protect us from debt.   Will the ECB continue to avoid country yields skyrocketing and there being any sign of debt market fragmentation?  Taking steps to avoid financial fragmentation is essential in order to implement monetary policy. We therefore introduced a new programme – the pandemic emergency purchase programme – which was more flexible than previous ones, precisely to combat any fragmentation of financial markets along national lines. But this programme also has a second role, which is to support our core price stability mandate. The economy is currently subject to lockdown measures and inflation is moving away from our objective of 2%, so we need to take action to stimulate demand and strengthen the inflation path.   What can we expect from the ECB’s strategy review?  We will review each and every aspect of the strategy. But there is not much use in speculating about the outcome while the process is still ongoing. We are involved in very complex discussions. It is a question of striking an overall balance – a typical case of nothing being agreed until everything is agreed. And we will present our final conclusions in late 2021.   But how far can the review go? Might we potentially see a new inflation objective in excess of 2%?  We will look at all elements. No specific factors will be excluded: the numerical issue of defining price stability, the instruments concerned, the interaction between monetary policy and financial supervision, the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability, the interaction between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We will be looking at everything.   Can we expect to see banks in difficulties, as was the case during the financial crisis? Particularly in countries whose financial sectors have been more vulnerable, such as Portugal, Spain or Italy.  I’d like to challenge that assumption. There are no countries that are inherently “more vulnerable”. Past experience shows that in all countries, if there is a prolonged period of recession, bank balance sheets will run into trouble as companies and households struggle to repay their loans. The outcome is different depending on how quickly countries react and what their fiscal capacity to react is. Portugal and Italy are not fiscally constrained today in the way they were a decade ago. But clearly all authorities need to work to bring our economy out of recession as soon as possible, otherwise banks will be affected. Nothing is inevitable. Our response to this crisis is entirely different from ten years ago.   Have supervisors responded differently?  When the financial crisis hit in 2008, the reaction of many supervisors was largely procyclical. This time it has been quite different. The ECB has encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers for lending purposes and loss absorption. It has introduced supervisory flexibility for the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs). And we are discussing further potential responses at European level. Sooner or later, I would expect banks to be affected by the crisis. Whether or not it will result in a banking crisis will depend on the policies that we adopt. We are aware of the risks and are not in denial. We will continue to monitor the situation and be ready to act if things deteriorate.  Would the creation of a European “bad bank” to deal with NPLs be a good idea?  If we take the view that tensions in a country are caused by weaknesses or poor policy decisions within that country, there might be less willingness to take action at European level, using European resources. But we now have supervision of significant institutions at European level. This has, together with a greater focus on NPLs, made banks more robust. And this time, we have seen a common shock that is also affecting banks which are better off and supervised at European level. This strengthens the case for intervening with European tools in the event of tensions in the financial sector.  Should banks continue to not distribute dividends next year?  As long as it remains unclear how the situation will develop, banks should be prudent. If they do not pay out dividends this year, they can distribute more next year and are in the meantime better positioned to face a severe crisis situation. If I had the choice between the two approaches, I would rather be more prudent, but this might mean a cost to the banks. I believe that a reasonable solution, as economic conditions improve, would be a case-by-case approach by banking supervisors.   Are mergers and acquisitions within European banking an appropriate way of making the financial sector more robust?  Some mergers and acquisitions are successful and others are not. Empirical evidence suggests that those that are successful involve a stronger buyer acquiring a weaker “target”. I have not looked at every transaction in detail but my feeling is that most cases tie in with this pattern. They can also help reduce excess capacity in the European banking market, which in some cases results in inefficiencies, excessively low profitability and ultimately financial fragility. But we are still mainly seeing consolidation within domestic markets, rather than across countries. Consolidation across countries would be more beneficial for the banks themselves and for the European financial market as a whole, as it would allow for diversification of risk and reduce the impact of adverse developments in individual Member States.   On Joe Biden, US President-elect   We are facing global challenges that require a global response. It is essential that the world’s major economies and the international community work closely together, in particular through multilateral institutions. This would be an important step forward and would reduce uncertainty, including for trade and the global economy.   "
2020-11-25,Yves Mersch,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 23 November 2020","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 23 November 2020 25 November 2020  How much does the second wave of coronavirus infections and lockdowns darken the eurozone economic outlook?  Governments have learned very rapidly with this pandemic and the recent set of lockdown measures have been much less growth-damaging and much more targeted so the fallout might be mitigated. We also have an extension of the support measures that have been very helpful with the first lockdown and the fiscal response also has to be factored in. What we can see right now is that there is an increase in fragmentation, insofar as we have a divergence between the services sector and the manufacturing sector. That means some countries' economic structures are hit more or less depending on how dependent they are on the services sector and within the services sector those areas that are more exposed to the pandemic consequences and the lockdowns.  Do you expect a double dip recession?  We believe it will probably be difficult to maintain positive growth going into the fourth quarter, although if I look at the German figures, Germany might achieve it. Other countries clearly might not achieve it and overall it would not be surprising if after a very bad month of November we had zero or even negative growth. However, as of today it is premature to draw the conclusion that this will last into the next quarters of next year and there will be consecutive quarters of negative growth. In the course of 2021 we will have available several vaccines, which alleviates also the logistical challenge.   What would you like to be the outcome from the ECB’s current recalibration of its monetary policy instruments?   Calibration has different meanings. It could be rectification. It could be simply an extension on the time axis. It could be an extension of the volume or the intensity. We said we would look at all our instruments and would take a decision on how we can be most efficient. It is true that we have our whole panoply of instruments available. We have seen that in these circumstances some have a higher amount of traction than others and those that have had in our opinion a rather good amount of traction have been the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme and the Targeted Longer Term Refinancing Operations. We said they would run until at least June next year. Since the consequences of this pandemic probably have a longer duration than foreseen when we took the latest calibration decisions in the summer, an obvious candidate for calibration is the timeline extension. There is a second approach, to see whether we should become more targeted or more focused, or on the contrary consider now untested instruments, a theoretical possibility in an all encompassing discussion.  Could the deposit rate be cut further - for instance if the euro continued to appreciate against the US dollar?  It is an instrument that is still there. We have very little knowledge about when the reversal rate would be kicking in. However, I also admit that I would rather not test that by all means, as it could diverge from one country to another. My belief is in this respect that confidence of the public in its central bank is something we should not lose sight of.  Given the increase in national debt levels, is there a danger of fiscal dominance, in other words of monetary policy becoming subservient to fiscal policy?   Obviously if you have no public debt on your books, the risk of fiscal dominance is further away than if you have it. However, you should not forget in this debate that compared to central banks in other jurisdictions we are from a legal point of view particularly well protected as we have the prohibition of monetary financing in our primary law and our independence is also enshrined in the treaty. It is true that we have seen over the last couple of months an increasing number of voices who have ventured into that territory of monetizing national or local debt. These voices do not seem to measure the consequences of such ideas on the favourable financing conditions we have achieved and the risks to an unfinished EMU architecture. But again we are lucky in that we have primary law that protects us. And the ECJ protects the rule of law.   How is the ECB’s strategy review likely to change its inflation target and should it follow the US Federal Reserve in shifting to average inflation targeting?  We have taken note of the FED decision, but we have a mandate for European circumstances that are different. If you want to be well understood you should be simple. I can see the argument in having an objective that is formulated in a simpler way than it currently is where we use several words - close to but below 2% - but this is an ongoing discussion and if time comes the Governing Council will inform about the right decision.   How far should the ECB go to tackle climate change?  It is not our principal policy mandate, but we have a nudging capacity through the size of our balance sheet to be supportive of those decisions that the people with political legitimacy will have to take. But we cannot substitute for them, that is clear.  How worried are you that Poland and Hungary’s opposition could scupper the EU recovery fund?   I agree it is not pleasant to see this dillydallying. It is not always very dignified either. But you know this is very often the case in Europe: we are not very fast in decision-making. But at least we are not going backwards. So I am quite confident that in the end our leaders will find a solution. The fiscal policy decision-makers are fully aware that they cannot squander the positive benefits of the announcement of these measures in the financial markets. Even those who have more difficulties coming into line, why would they do damage to their own economy?  The mood currently seems to be that governments should spend, spend, spend and worry about debt levels later - but are we storing up problems for the future?  It is inevitable that excessive or unsustainable levels of leverage in whatever sector of the economy is always a matter of concern especially from the financial stability perspective. We have also seen that as of late, banks have increasingly unloaded exposures from their balance sheet to the sovereign again. Very often these exposures are to do with public guarantees that have been extended to the corporates. So it is a corporate-sovereign-bank nexus. As long as the interest rate is below the growth rate, I think the issues of sustainability might not be in the foreground; however, we have a mandate to respect price stability and we could not look the other way if there were to be inflationary pressures, which we do not see at this point in time. We have seen very high levels of debt. Calculations have also shown that if we increase our productivity by accelerating the integration of technological innovation, growth will be able to offset the accumulated debt. On the other hand, one cannot exclude a tail risk to the other extreme, at least not in theory. So we have to follow this and monitor it quite closely.   Is Andrea Enria, Chair of the ECB Supervisory Board, right to warn of a potential €1.4tn surge in bad loans for eurozone banks?  The figure is correct - but it is based not on our central, baseline scenario but on a severe, extreme scenario. As of today, I do not see an economic situation that is going to lead to a severe scenario. Some banks had scenarios in their internal models, which were not central scenarios, but were very rosy scenarios. That is why we called on the banks to consider the main scenarios from public authorities, international organisations, or even their own countries.  The second point is that we told the banks that the debt moratoria cannot last forever. There is no reason for them not to already be following up on the debtors’ real health and on whether some of the debtors have simply frozen and are able to start activity as normal again or whether their situation has deteriorated because their business model has been greatly affected due to this pandemic and that would make for a different viability assessment.  Does this mean the banks should not be allowed to restart dividend payments and share buy-backs at the end of this year?   Banks entered into this cycle with stronger capital buffers than was the case in the previous financial crisis. But on the other hand we have seen that the increase in the solvency ratio has been largely the effect of monetary policy and regulatory decisions. That means we have relaxed some of our standards, creating additional capital available for the banking system to an amount about three to four times the intended distribution of dividends. So to some extent it would be a little bit spurious or surprising if the banks were to use the public subsidies to enrich the shareholders. As long as the banks are dependent on such support and they are asking for continued support I think we should be very conservative with the pure resumption of payout ratios that we have seen before the crisis.  That does not mean that we would in all cases need to maintain a blanket ban with legal uncertainty as we have only an enforcement instrument in our regulation based on a case-by-case approach. In other jurisdictions, there also seems to be a move towards a case-by-case approach. It would all depend on the conservatism of internal models in the banks, on conservatism in provisioning and a sound view of the capital trajectory of a bank. All this will need to be taken into account and then we will come to a proposal by the end of the year.  Is the financial sector doing enough to prepare for the UK leaving the EU single market?   By and large a lot has been achieved but more could still be done. We hear from banks that it is their customers who are not willing or not easily convinced. I also do not underestimate that the overall amount of contracts that required repapering or novation was gigantic and this work is still ongoing. There are individual cases where we are continuing to push and where what has been announced in the Brexit plans needs to be implemented. There are some instruments like uncleared derivatives - where the difficulty seems to be larger than in other contracts.  There might still be cases for UK entities where, for instance, if on 1 January there is no Brexit agreement, there is a risk that they would act on the continent with neither the proper authorisation nor the licence to provide services to EU clients. Extensive use of third country national regimes could also pose risks to the level playing field and could undermine the integrity of supervision as banks and investment firms may unduly use these regimes and other national exemptions in order to avoid the European banking supervision. We will follow this.  Our message is clear: EU products and transactions with EU clients should be booked in the EU. Risk management capabilities related to these products should also be located in the EU.  Having been on the ECB Governing Council since the start in 1998, how has it changed in that time and what lessons do you draw from your experience?  At the beginning in ’98 the priority was very clearly on overcoming our natural instinct of behaving like the council of ministers - that means in an intergovernmental way - while we were supposed to react in a more federal decision-making way. That absorbed quite a lot of our energy. Wim Duisenberg can take great merit in this respect and especially also the second president, Jean-Claude Trichet, who put a great deal of energy on trying to connect with all the members to bring them on board before any decision was taken. We then entered into more permanent crisis management mode under the third president. He also was a great listener. His listening was not though exclusively to the internal institution. And the new president again puts a lot of importance on being inclusive, on being cohesive as a Governing Council. So you see there are cycles in the life of the institution that have to do with leaders inklings, but also with the members of the decision-making bodies. That means that people must be able to look beyond their home base and try to have an understanding of the intricacies and the structures of their neighbouring economies. The amount of disagreement has been mostly at the fringes. For example, there are people who are much more concerned about the immediacy of the consequences of an external shock and its containment and there are others who would very much at the same moment also like to keep in mind the longer-term consequences. These are natural and even useful confontations of valid points of views.   "
2020-11-22,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Les Echos,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Guillaume Benoit, Elsa Conesa and Sophie Rolland","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Les Echos   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Guillaume Benoit, Elsa Conesa and Sophie Rolland 22 November 2020  The European economy is facing further lockdowns. What are the immediate and long-term consequences and do you think there is a risk of another recession?  Our focus is more on the spread of the virus, which is inevitably holding back the behaviour of consumers, and not just on the lockdown measures themselves. However, if you put those two factors together, absolutely, we do think they will lead to a drop in activity. The question is how long this period will last and that will depend on the behavioural response and the degree to which the measures are respected. Compared to the lockdown in spring, these measures are less harsh. Manufacturing has been kept open, construction is continuing, essential shops remain open, and there is not too much disruption to supply chains. So the impact is likely to be less severe this time. However, the situation can change very fast, from one day to the next. This makes it extremely difficult to make any precise estimates of the impact. What does seem certain, however, is that the situation will not materially improve in the last weeks of 2020.  Is the progress being made on coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines a game changer?  Until the vaccine is fully rolled out we remain in a period of uncertainty. We have already had to undergo two sets of restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic and these will certainly not be the last. The vaccine gives more of a vision for what may be late next year, and what 2022 will look like, but not for the next six months. We have a bit of a paradox, which is that the financial markets have responded instantly, because these price the effects of the vaccine based not just on what’s happening today or the next year, but based on future earnings in 2022, 2023 and 2024. From the point of view of a central bank, or for governments, that helps. It’s much easier to pursue an accommodative fiscal policy and support GDP growth in the meantime if you know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Bearing this in mind, 1 May was the first day we published our multi-year baseline scenario given the assumption that a vaccine or a medical solution would be found by around mid-2021. So what we see now is broadly confirming that we were on the right track. The most severe scenarios are less likely now, but there remains a big gap between now and the end. So right now there’s a lot to play for.  So when do you think these changes will start to alter the trajectory of GDP growth?  Our projections assume that the vaccine will be rolled out throughout next year. But the full recovery of GDP, back to where it was in 2019, will not happen before the autumn of 2022. So we do not assume that everything just bounces back to where it was before COVID-19, because there’s going to be longer-term effects in terms of confidence and savings, and getting people back to work. In spite of the vaccine, there will be some persistent damage and the European economy will not exit this crisis without being weakened over a long period of time.  How is France dealing with the situation? What is the outlook?  Of course, France is a big part of Europe’s growth performance, but we primarily conduct our analyses at the euro area level. I would only say here that, where you have a temporary macroeconomic shock, you do need a fiscal response which is suitably aggressive, and one that supports this demand across the euro area, for firms and households alike. The headache for policymakers will be knowing where to draw the line between those firms that are viable and those that are not.  Do you feel that asset purchases were not sufficient to sustain demand?  The general consensus is that central banks should bring down interest rates and purchase assets. This also creates room for fiscal policy, and under these conditions, fiscal measures should have a far bigger impact on the overall dynamics of the economy. The main role for monetary policy this year has been to stabilise the financial system and to circumvent financial market distress. Low interest rates are good news for firms and for households. But only fiscal policies are capable of targeting individual sectors and monetary policy is not tailored to do that.  Do you mean to say that the fiscal policies of European governments are not aggressive enough?  Governments are still finalising their 2021 budgets, and Europe, collectively, needs to make sure that the fiscal policies are sufficiently responsive. In the last number of weeks and months, more and more governments have put in place stimulus programmes for 2021. It is for the government policymakers to take the lead role here. If, for example, France or any other country stimulates its economy, that will also benefit the rest of Europe, and so to have a collective discussion is beneficial.  Are you worried about the current delays in negotiations over the Next Generation EU plan?  We should not attach too much importance to short delays in finalising the Next Generation EU (NGEU) plan. Of course, every EU Member State has to agree and very quickly come to a final decision on it. If it’s a matter of a number of weeks, it’s not so important, because the governments have already put stimulus packages in place. This plan is not meant to stimulate the economy by bridging the gap between now and when the vaccines are rolled out, but to provide a vision for the next five years. We will need to face the challenges of digitalisation and climate change. There will still be a lot of nervous consumers and also firms will need to rebuild their investment capacity. The NGEU is about showing that the European Union and the euro area have a very strong solidarity: where we have a common shock, part of the way we address that is through a commonly-funded programme, such as the common bond issuance, to help particularly those countries most hit.  Do you have a view on what kind of resources you can fund this new debt with?  Well, this is just going to be a choice for the European governments. But in a low interest rate world, the amount of revenue that needs to be raised by the European Union to cover the interest rate cost is very limited.  Are the new EU bonds finally the European safe asset that the markets have long been expecting?  What’s important for Europe is that the pool of safe assets expands -- and we are already seeing it with the SURE bonds, which they’re issuing at different maturities -- so that you have a good yield curve and can respond to investor expectations. Around that, you can develop the derivatives market. But it’s important not to set up a kind of a contest between the EU bonds and the national bonds. The supranational and the national bonds are to coexist and it’s important that the national bonds are also classified as high grade. I can see, by the way, that the announcement of Next Generation EU has been very good news for the national bond markets. Global investors are recognising that this will strengthen the euro area as a whole.  Some observers have taken Christine Lagarde’s speech at Sintra as a turning point in strategy, opening the door to implicit control of the yield curve by the ECB. Should investors now expect the ECB to intervene based on European sovereign yields?  In October we said we would recalibrate our monetary policy instruments at our meeting in December. In the context of the pandemic, our role is to provide favourable financing conditions. Sovereign yields are important for governments and the private sector. But we’re also looking at the credit conditions on the market and the terms and conditions banks are offering, since the European economy is still very bank-dependent. So when we consider favourable financing conditions, we also look at the credit margins applied to small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporates and households. We don’t look at just one sovereign yield indicator. It is important to avoid euro area fragmentation.  What metrics will you look at to decide when to terminate the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)?  It takes time for monetary policy to filter through to the economy. There is no exact mapping between the dynamics of the virus and our monetary policy measures. However, we closely study the impact of the pandemic on economic activity: for example, further interruptions of economic activity would clearly suggest that it would be too early to terminate the PEPP. We won’t terminate the programme until certain conditions have been met. First of all, the pandemic must no longer interrupt normal economic activity. We will also have to establish other conditions in terms of economic recovery and inflation dynamics, but it’s still too early to do this. The programme was originally designed to last until the end of June, but we have always said that it would continue until the crisis phase is over.   Is monetary policy now focused on providing support to fiscal policies?   At a time when we are experiencing a common shock and governments are running higher deficits to support their economies, our asset purchases under our various programmes enable us to maintain favourable financing conditions. Monetary policy and fiscal policies are moving in the same direction. But this may not always be the case. Monetary policy and fiscal policies may move in opposite directions again in the future. Remember that in 2015-2019 governments were shrinking their deficits, while there were significant asset purchases. As we say in our forward guidance, our net purchases (under our asset purchase programme) will continue until we are in a position to raise interest rates, which will require inflation to be back in the neighbourhood of our aim. The first phase will then be to stop adding to the stock of debt. Then after that point, at some point, there could be a discussion about shrinking the balance sheet. So, ending asset purchases depends on what’s happening to inflation. In our September projections – which will be updated in December ‑ we don’t see inflation reaching our aim in the next two years.  The ECB is currently struggling to convince markets of its ability to achieve its inflation objective. Shouldn’t this objective be redefined?  Since the summer of 2019, our monetary policy introductory statement has explicitly referred to our symmetric approach to maintaining price stability. Looking to the future, the definition of price stability and our objectives in that area are being examined as part of the monetary policy strategy review. All of the Governing Council members and many of our teams throughout the Eurosystem are involved in this review, which is still ongoing, and it is still too early to say what the outcome will be.  Several market participants consider that there won’t be any more rate cuts and that the deposit rate has reached floor level. Is that a good interpretation of what the ECB is saying?  We don’t think we are at the lower bound; we do think there is room for further cuts in the future. That's why we continue to say that we expect rates to be at their current or lower levels until inflation has returned robustly to where we want it to be. We still believe lowering interest rates is a viable option. But we have to decide which instruments are currently the most effective. So far, we've been indicating that the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) have been very effective.   Should the flexibility of the PEPP also be applied to your other asset purchase programmes?  The starting point is the capital key (which determines the share held by each Member State in the ECB’s capital according to each Member State’s share of euro area gross domestic product and population). The capital key should continue to be the natural guide underpinning our asset purchase programmes, there's a very strong validity to that. But under conditions of market stress it also makes a lot of sense to not impose restrictions on ourselves that would basically damage the efficiency of monetary policy, particularly given that the most important key word of this year is uncertainty. And even though deviations from the capital key have come down in recent months, retaining flexibility under the PEPP is important to reassure everyone that the central bank will do its job in terms of market stabilisation.  Is there any concern that if the PEPP is maintained for a long period, even after the public health effects of the pandemic have subsided, that this could lead to further protests from the Federal German Constitutional Court, for example?   I think everything we do needs to be proportional and efficient. The approach we take is that we have to be able to explain the logic of our decisions. There is very strong logic in building flexibility into the PEPP. And it’s important that we were able to implement it. But it will come to an end once the pandemic crisis ends, as will the associated impact on the economy and inflation. The temporary nature of the PEPP allows much flexibility.   Is the cancellation of sovereign debt held by the ECB an option? Some people in the economy are calling for a measure of this kind.   The answer is very simple: it is prohibited by the Treaty. We cannot do monetary financing. But over and above this question, I think that every part of the policy world, civil society and the financial system needs to absorb the implications of low interest rates. The cost of issuing debt is very low, which lowers the cost of debt servicing.  Do you think that you should increase the liquidity programme for banks? The last quarterly lending survey shows that the first signs of tightening financial conditions are visible.  We take the results of that survey very seriously. Between now and our meeting in December, we will continue to look at the possibility of redesigning our targeted lending programme, which has been very important. We will look at a possible redesign, continuation or extension. But we must also learn from previous TLTRO operations ‑ for which the take-up rate has been very high – and study how these are affecting the balance sheets of the banks. The very basic condition is that you only get the low rate if you maintain credit to the private sector, to households and firms. We do have to study this to make sure the programme is as efficient as it should be.  Should TLTROs be even more accommodative than they are at present?   The TLTRO has many dimensions: the volume of loans required to qualify for the programme, the duration and the interest rate. I think you would have to take all of these into account.  Do you think banks should benefit from another round of softening of prudential measures?   I think you will have to ask my banking supervision colleagues that question. We maintain a strict separation between monetary policy and prudential supervision. What I will say is: this year, the supervisory decisions were quite important.  Do you believe non-performing loans should be removed from bank balance sheets and ring-fenced in a specific vehicle?   Again, I'll point you to the work of Andrea Enria who has been advocating certain solutions. Asset management companies can play an important role. But again, I think I'll defer to my banking supervision colleagues on that.  Are QE policies leading to greater inequality in the euro area?   That’s an important question. Asset purchases are the main vehicle of our stimulus policy, along with low interest rates. This has an instant impact on asset prices in the form of higher stock market valuations and higher house prices, which will benefit those who own these assets. In contrast, the amount of interest income earned from owning bonds is much lower. This could be a cause for concern from a wealth distribution perspective. For example, it could be an issue in countries where employees need to save a lot for retirement…   …That is worrying…  …At the same time, by lowering the cost of debt for governments, asset purchases lower the cost of debt servicing. If interest rates were higher, governments would have to run austerity policies by raising taxes and making public expenditure cuts. Savers would benefit from higher interest rates, but those with mortgages, student loans or car loans would lose out. We believe asset purchases have helped to save many jobs in Europe and led to faster wage increases, and through those dimensions it’s been good for many households in Europe.  The euro recently came close to its highest level against the dollar for quite some time. What level would give you cause for concern? And what can the ECB do?  The euro area economy is an open one. It is mostly driven by domestic factors, but the exchange rate does of course matter for the future of the GDP and inflation dynamics. That’s why we refer to it in our recent statements. It feeds in with lots of other things that can have an impact on prices. If the inflation projection is not satisfactory then we respond. But we do not target the exchange rate.   "
2020-11-21,Yves Mersch,Interview with Börsen-Zeitung,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Kai Johannsen and published on 21 November 2020 ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Börsen-Zeitung   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Kai Johannsen and published on 21 November 2020  21 November 2020 [Updated on 27 November at 11:30 CET.]  Mr Mersch, is it part of the European Central Bank’s mandate to engage with the capital market segment of green and sustainable finance?  The EU Treaties require the ECB to give primacy to the objective of price stability. If ECB’s engagement with the green and sustainable financial sector were necessary for maintaining price stability in the euro area, it would fall within the remit of our primary objective. I don’t think that applies at present.  In addition, the ECB has what are known as secondary objectives. Without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability, we support the general economic policies in the EU “with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union”. One of these objectives is to work towards “a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment”. This justifies why the ECB is also looking into sustainability.  However, contrary to what some may argue, that does not mean that the ECB is free to take the initiative and decide itself how “a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment” is to be achieved. For good reason, that remains the privilege of elected politicians.   What are the risks facing green and sustainable finance over the coming years?   I would see it as a risk if green finance degenerated into a pure marketing tool. If investors want to make the world a greener place, they need to know how their investments contribute to more sustainability. To put it in technical terms, I see the risk of informational market failures if information on the sustainability of businesses and financial products is inconsistent, largely not comparable and at times unreliable or even completely unavailable. Definitions of what constitutes a sustainable investment are often subjective and inconsistent. The EU taxonomy is a promising initiative, albeit incomplete. Its practical usability remains a challenge. Plans are also under way for widely applicable industry standards.  What else is needed?   Better and more standardised non-financial reporting will also be crucial. This is essential for correctly pricing the risks. Sound reporting is the cornerstone of appropriate risk management.  Finally, financial institutions, including banks, need to ensure they can identify at an early stage, and deal with, the risks emerging from the effects of climate change and a rapid transition to a carbon-neutral economy. Only once these prerequisites are met can sustainable finance prosper and have a tangible impact on the real economy. Otherwise there remains a risk of “greenwashing” and of an unsustainable “green bubble” detached from fundamental data.  The EU taxonomy for green and sustainable finance is a complex system of classification intended to give investors and providers of financial products certainty as to what can be classified as green and sustainable. Is this a masterstroke by the EU that will advance this market segment and possibly also serve as an example for other countries and regions?  The EU Taxonomy Regulation is important. A sound classification system provides investors with valuable information for their investment decisions. The taxonomy was designed with green bonds in mind. Its application to other financial products may not be as straightforward and the overall design might need to be adjusted.  Moreover, the system is indeed very complex.   What does that mean for risk assessment in practice?  I see a certain gap between its envisaged objective and its practical usability.  However useful the taxonomy may be for green investment decisions, it will not help in the risk assessment of economic activities exposed to climate risk. Finally and more fundamentally, the taxonomy is only one piece of the puzzle: granular data at the corporate level are required in order for it to be usable.  If we address these shortcomings, the EU can set an example for the parallel processes now under way in other countries. We have one of the most advanced frameworks for sustainable finance. The EU taxonomy can be an important element in promoting the EU regulatory approach abroad, and in strengthening the EU’s role as a global hub for sustainable finance.   When do you expect financial markets and market participants to be fully green and sustainable?  I don’t think that the entire financial sector will one day be green. There are many industries that are neither clean nor dirty and they also raise funding on the market. Moreover, I don’t think we can stop climate change by choking off entire sectors of the economy. We should rather create the right incentives through, say, fiscal policy measures, including carbon pricing and other regulatory tools.  Finally, the financial sector can indeed help, but it can’t save the planet on its own.   We are now transitioning towards green and sustainable capital markets: what specific transition risks do you see in this phase?  The transition towards a greener and more sustainable capital market may lead to a repricing of assets. If this adjustment happens abruptly, i.e. if the redirection of capital proceeds in an unexpected or disorderly way, we talk about transition risks.  However, compared with the potential economic losses arising from climate risks, the transitory losses that may occur are paltry. But individual banks could certainly be hit hard: the bulk of exposures to the most energy-intensive borrowers are held by just a few banks. In other words, a few banks have very high exposures.   Are the banks already providing sufficient disclosure on specific risks that are neither green nor sustainable, i.e. largely brown assets, and do you already incorporate these in the ECB’s banking supervision? How far do the banks go in their disclosure and do they go far enough for the ECB?  I see a need for further action in that regard. It’s true that the disclosure of climate-related risks has improved, but mostly the information is just not detailed enough, and only seldom supported by quantitative data. We will soon be publishing a “Guide on climate-related and environmental risks”. The Guide sets out how, in our view, institutions should take climate and environmental risks into consideration in their business strategies, governance and risk management frameworks and how these are to be disclosed. We looked at the disclosure for last year from [a sample of] the institutions that we supervise – [more than half almost all] of them did not even meet the minimum [requirements] set out in the Guide. In relation to this we will soon be publishing a report on the disclosure of environmental risks of the banks under our supervision.  Does that provide any first lessons for the ECB?  Yes. That is why we will devote our 2022 stress test to the topic of climate change. This stress test should not only be analytical and top-down, but, in the hope of a better data situation, a better taxonomy and better standards, also enable a meaningful bottom-up approach.   Are you concerned that a major case of greenwashing could arise, which could trigger a chain reaction and result in a sharp downturn in the financial markets? Are the markets sufficiently forearmed against this, or in other words, are they stable enough?  There is no doubt that greenwashing is an issue, even if an improvement is in sight. The European Commission will soon present a legislative proposal for an EU green bond standard. However, a green bond does not necessarily tell us how green a company is as a whole. The classification relates instead to individual assets that these bonds are intended to finance. These assets are only part of the company’s balance sheet, which could indeed also include conventional assets with a bigger carbon footprint. Thus, on their own, green bonds are not sufficient for a greener real economy.  What would in your view be helpful?  A welcome Commission initiative concerns the introduction of an EU ecolabel for financial products and in particular for investment funds. This should allow retail investors who are concerned about the environmental impact of their investments to rely on a trustworthy and verified label and hence make informed investment decisions. At the same time incentives could be created for financial markets to develop more products with a reduced or positive environmental impact. It remains a problem that markets may not yet be able to correctly assess the fundamentals of green financial products. This is for instance the case with green bonds, where there are large differences in the extent to which the bond proceeds are truly invested in green and sustainable projects.  How important are sustainability ratings? Do you already deploy these ratings in your supervision? Are the ratings robust enough for an appropriate estimation of risks and opportunities?  The current environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings of banks do not reflect their lending to companies with high carbon emissions. Similarly, they are also not an appropriate measure of credit risk. These ratings are more concerned with social responsibility. Carbon emission figures could provide a better proxy for the physical and transition risks to which companies are exposed.  An issue that comes up repeatedly is that each agency uses different metrics for their sustainability ratings: the same data are assessed or weighed in different ways. Should providers therefore report several sustainability ratings or just one?  The fact that ratings vary so much across providers is largely due to three factors: first, the underlying raw data and calculation methodologies; second, the methodologies used to compute the ratings; and, third, the qualitative elements underlying each assessment. Therefore, providers should present metrics and ratings in a transparent way so that investors can understand them. What is even more important is that data gaps in the underlying data are closed. This brings us back to disclosure, for which the taxonomy framework and reliable labels for sustainable financial products – including an EU standard for green bonds – are crucial.  Does the ECB deploy green and sustainable investments in its fund management – of pension funds, say? If so, what are the investment criteria, what kinds of investment are excluded?  The pension funds are managed autonomously. The management has undertaken to adhere to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment and thus to include sustainability standards.  In addition, we have increased the share of green bonds in our own funds portfolio and will continue to do so in future. We follow the Sustainable and Responsible Investment Guide for Central Banks’ Portfolio Management from the Network for Greening the Financial System, of which we are a member.   "
2020-11-17,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with CNBC,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach, CNBC, on 12 November and aired on 13 November","   INTERVIEW  Interview with CNBC   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach, CNBC, on 12 November and aired on 13 November 17 November 2020  Thank you for talking to us tonight. The virtual Sintra conference is over. What are your main takeaways from the conference?  It’s a pleasure to be talking to you today. The ECB Forum is always our big annual event, and we discussed all the big topics that are on the table. Of course, this year the ECB Forum was very much dominated by the pandemic on the one hand and long-term structural trends on the other. And both of those are playing a very important role in our ongoing monetary policy strategy review. So, in a sense, the ECB Forum is also part of our listening events, because we had all these interesting people presenting their papers and participating in panels. And one of the important messages is that life has become more complicated for economic policy, including monetary policy and fiscal policy. It seems that we can only do it together. There is a need to act in a complementary fashion. I think that this is actually a very important message.   What do you mean by “life is actually getting more complicated”? Perhaps you have some examples?  From the central banking perspective, the biggest issue is the long-term decline in the natural real interest rate, which poses challenges. And these challenges already appeared years ago because interest rates were approaching the zero lower bound, which is now called the effective lower bound. This makes it difficult for central banks because they can no longer use conventional monetary policy tools and have to use unconventional monetary policy tools instead. But, as I said in the panel I was chairing today, the unconventional tools have become quite conventional by now.  You have been talking about the possibility of cutting rates further into negative territory. Is that a policy option that is also realistic for December?  We have always said that we are going to look at all the instruments. President Lagarde also made that clear in the press conference. But there are reasons why we haven’t reduced interest rates in the past and now we have to check whether these reasons are still valid.   What are the reasons for not dragging them lower? Perhaps that might make the market understand what you are looking at exactly.  One important argument is the effects that low rates may have on the banking sector. We have been thinking about this quite a lot and we introduced new measures to help counteract these effects, such as the tiering multiplier, which is quite important and has been quite successful. All of our monetary policy decisions always involve a cost-benefit analysis. We have to look at the effectiveness of the measures in the current circumstances and we have to think about the side effects, and we will always choose those instruments for which this balance is the best.   President Lagarde has narrowed down the focus on increases to the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and potential new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), or a recalibration of the current TLTROs. How likely do you think it is that we will get an extension of the whole programme, because clearly that would also be a big signal?  What the Governing Council said is that, in the December meeting, we will recalibrate our instruments, as appropriate, in order to preserve favourable financing conditions and counteract the impact of the pandemic on our inflation outlook. What the President added in her Sintra speech is that – and this is an important point – it’s not only about the level of financing conditions but also the duration. The important message is that the ECB is going to be there for as long as necessary. And what that means depends very much on the evolution of the pandemic and on the speed of the roll-out of the vaccine. All of this is very important. Given that all these measures may be with us for quite some time, we also know that potential side effects may get bigger over time. Therefore, I think we also have to discuss the intensity of our asset purchases, which is also important. So we have to ask: what is the intensity of purchases that is needed to preserve historically low financial conditions?  By intensity do you mean the monthly pace of purchases?   Exactly.  So, would you rather say we need to be very flexible when it comes to that? So, for example, if we see fragmentation increasing, if we see the economy deteriorating, that you can increase it very flexibly?  Yes, flexibility is certainly key. We saw in March that the flexibility was extremely important to deal with that situation of market turbulence. Of course, we are now in a very different situation than in March, because financing conditions are extremely benign and we do not face any market turbulence. And this is also why I think we cannot just do the same all over again, but we have to rethink what is the best and most efficient way to act in order to achieve our objectives. There is broad agreement that what is key is that financial conditions remain at this favourable level. And the question is: how can this best be ensured? Let me add that monetary policy will not be able to do it alone; we also rely on fiscal policy, which has to remain active for as long as needed. Monetary policy and fiscal policy have acted in a very complementary way in the past month and I think this should continue. So, both monetary policy and fiscal policy must not be withdrawn too early. And especially at this current time of very high uncertainty, the fiscal side is important, because the private sector may be reluctant to spend, that is consumers may be reluctant to consume and firms may be reluctant to invest. This is why public expenditure is very important, which may then also spill over to private spending.  Are you also supporting banks and the financial sector to be able to lend enough to the real economy, given the enormous pressure they are under as well as the risk of non-performing loans? So in other words, are you looking at TLTROs and potential changes in the tiering?  Let me first stress that, given that the euro area is a bank-based economy, the bank lending channel is absolutely crucial for us. And we have to make sure that this bank lending channel remains operational. In the first months of the pandemic, I think the TLTROs played a very beneficial role. The most important feature of the TLTROs is that they are targeted, which means that there is an incentive to fulfil a certain lending threshold. And I think this principle is important. I also think this will have to play an important role in the new measures, so that there is an incentive for banks to continue lending, because we are a bit worried about that. In the recent bank lending surveys, we have seen that some banks expect a tightening in credit standards. Of course, we have also seen a drop in demand for loans. These are very challenging times. And so it’s important that lending remains as strong as needed in order to get out of this pandemic and to support the recovery.  This week we also saw substantial news on the vaccine front. So do you think that is actually a game changer for the economic recovery?  This is, of course, excellent news. And I think everybody was very relieved. If we look at the economic developments, what we’ve seen is that there was this very strong rebound, stronger than expected in the third quarter. This is good news because it shows that, once restrictions are lifted, there is actually the potential to recover quickly. But then we also saw the rise in infections. And this has led to new lockdowns, which have substantially dampened the outlook for the fourth quarter, and also for the first quarter of next year. So our outlook has become more pessimistic. I think the positive news on the vaccine now basically puts us back in our baseline scenario, because the baseline scenario that we formulated in the middle of the year foresees a vaccine being rolled out in 2021. So this is not a game changer in that sense. But it kind of leads to a slight improvement compared with how things were before that news.  If you look at the economic recovery, clearly the recession, or the potential recession, is more or less led by the services sector. Are you thinking that will also have an effect on the strength of the recovery? Because there’s not so much pent-up demand?  Yes, exactly. This was also one of the major points in President Lagarde’s speech, that this services recession may be very different from a regular recession. So one question is: how long will the recovery take? And another is: what are the effects on employment? So far, we’ve seen that the unemployment rate has not gone up that strongly, which is mostly due to the public support programmes, especially the job retention schemes. It’s also due to the fact that some people have actually just stopped looking for work altogether, and they do not count as unemployed. Christine Lagarde called them “discouraged” workers. So this recession is certainly different from others. What we also see, which I think is important, is that it hits different countries very differently. And it also hits different people within countries very differently. This actually raises new challenges, mostly on the fiscal side. But, of course, it also affects monetary policy.  You’re hinting at the effect that social equality is actually getting a lot worse because the pandemic is hitting those who anyway don’t earn much a lot harder than those who are rich, right?  Yes, we’re basically seeing the same thing at the country level and at the individual level – that the weakest are hit the hardest. And one really has to think carefully about how to deal with that. So why does that matter for monetary policy? It matters because the effects of monetary policy, just like fiscal policy, also depend on people’s propensity to consume. Those who are poorer typically spend a larger share of their income and therefore the composition of the population actually does have an effect on the transmission of monetary policy.  And let’s look at what it also means going forward for Europe versus the United States, because the bond markets, interestingly, are behaving as if the United States will recover a lot faster than Europe, because yields are picking up there once again. Do you think that’s fair on Europe?  Well, that remains to be seen. One advantage that the United States has is that, overall, its economy is a bit more flexible. So maybe some people expect that the United States will be able to adjust more quickly, also to the new world that we are going to face, because I think what is clear is that after the pandemic, the economy will look different from what we have now. So there will be structural changes. And it could be that the United States is better able to adjust to this new world. Apart from that, of course, many things in the United States will depend on fiscal policy. It is not yet clear whether there will be a big stimulus package or not, but for the United States, that will be very important.  But the President-elect Joe Biden has promised to deliver on that front; everything depends on whether the Democrats can also get a majority in the Senate.  Exactly. That’s a crucial point. And if not, I think the fiscal response will be weaker.  Today, I was speaking to the Siemens CEO, Joe Kaeser, who was very much pleased by China, and was saying that China will once again be dragging the world economy out of the situation it is in. Do you think we really depend on China when it comes to our economic recovery story?  Well, China has become a big player in world trade. So if China has a good recovery – and this is what we are seeing – this has a positive impact on world trade and all those companies that rely on exports benefit from that. I think it is actually good news that we are getting positive effects from the global side.  Falling natural rates and, at the same time, higher volatility and asset prices pose a problem for the formulation of monetary policy. So what does it mean exactly for the future of monetary policy, and also the level of rates?  What we’ve seen is that, due to the decline in the natural rate of interest, we’re more likely to hit the zero lower bound. And this constitutes a constraint for monetary policy. One important question in our monetary policy strategy review is what this actually implies for the inflation objective. So there are people who are proposing to raise the inflation target, but of course, there you get an issue of credibility, because if you haven’t been able to hit 2%, will you be able to hit 3%? That is not so clear. Then there are people who propose that one should follow a strategy like that of the US Federal Reserve. So, something like average inflation targeting, which works through an expectations channel. It relies very much on agents having forward-looking expectations and being rational. And again, it is far from clear whether these conditions are fulfilled. Then there are others who are a bit more modest and who say that we should have a clear commitment to symmetry. And actually, symmetry is already always in our introductory statement, so this would be an easy thing to do.  But you’ve not yet decided within the Governing Council on which is the best way to formulate an inflation target, right?  No, we haven’t come to a decision yet. And we are, of course, working on these topics intensively. We have regular meetings of the Executive Board, and especially of the Governing Council, in order to discuss all the background notes and analyses that are being produced. This is a big project that covers many important topics, and the whole strategy review will only be finished in the second half of next year.  Let’s talk a bit as well about the effectiveness of fiscal policy. It seems, according to the research papers which were also presented during the conference, that it works best at the lower bound, or rather the zero lower bound. Is that true? And why is that?  Well, there’s an easy explanation for that. You would normally say that when fiscal policy is very active it leads to a crowding-out effect because overall rates in the economy may increase. But if we are at the zero lower bound and can be sure that monetary policy remains active, that means that this crowding-out effect is not kicking in.   "
2020-11-17,Christine Lagarde,Interview with The New York Times,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Alison Smale and Jack Ewing on 10 November 2020","   INTERVIEW  Interview with The New York Times   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Alison Smale and Jack Ewing on 10 November 2020 17 November 2020  One of your priorities at the European Central Bank is putting together a plan to take on climate change. Do women bring a different set of perceptions to combating the damage it is causing?  I actually think so. I think women bring various powers to the table. One is the power of the purse, because I think that in many, many instances women are the decision makers when it comes to consuming. Second, I think they bring the power of life. I think that actually giving birth gives you a sense of prosperity, heritage, transmission, that is quite special.  Can you elaborate?  I know it’s going to be controversial but I think maternity is center to making sure that our children inherit something that is sustainable, that they can live in, live with and transmit to other generations. I also think that women are resilient, and I think that there are plenty of studies now that are showing that. And resilience in the face of change is something that is very needed. And then if I look around and ask myself who have been the drivers of the Paris Agreement [on climate change], I see a few lead speakers. But I see a lot of hard workers behind the scenes. And more often than not, the hard workers were women. And they were instrumental in getting the accord pushed across the finish line.  The United States has its first-ever woman as Vice President-elect. Do you know Kamala Harris and do you have any advice for this newest prominent global woman?  I don’t know her. I have observed her from a distance when I was in Washington, and particularly when she was part of the Judiciary Committee hearing in the Senate. And I was very impressed by the sort of surgical approach that she had in her questions, and by her standing and command in that situation. At long last a woman is Vice President-elect. I think it’s a cause for celebration and frankly she does not need any advice from me.  If you look at Europe, there are a number of women in high leadership positions. You’re the president of the European Central Bank. Ursula von der Leyen is the president of the European Commission. Angela Merkel of Germany is chancellor of the most populous country in the European Union. Has that made any difference do you think? What’s the effect of that?  I think that, first of all, it has helped that we know each other quite well, the three of us. And it has facilitated the very rapid exchange of communication without protocol by text messages or telephone calls. So that’s one dimension — easy communication between us. And number two, I don’t think any of us really cared whether we were getting the credit, and whether our ego was first and forward relative to the others. I think that has also helped. So less vanity maybe. And better communication.  How else can you enhance international cooperation, especially in our time of lockdown?  A multinational approach to some of these global issues is needed more than ever. I know this sounds very counterintuitive and probably not politically correct at the moment because it’s more fashionable to argue against globalization, to argue against multilateralism, but frankly we are learning something from the current pandemic. It is that we have to cooperate. It is that we have to disclose to each other what goes wrong. I would say that if the United States can return to the W.H.O. and the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], and exercise the kind of leadership that is expected from the largest economy in the world, it would be certainly helpful in order to tackle some of the global issues that have no borders.  As you’re well-aware, there are not very many women on the 25-person governing council of the E.C.B. We know that’s a process that you don’t control, but is there anything you can do about it so that when individual countries have an opening for a Central Bank president they look at women candidates?  As you said, it’s something that is decided by governments when they appoint governors for their national central banks. What I can do is when there is a vacancy I can raise my voice. I can pick up the phone. I can impress upon them that it’s a bit ridiculous to have out of 25 members only two women. And thank goodness there are two of us now. And I can take photos like the one I took at a retreat that we had exactly a year ago in November. And at the time there was not even two women on the board. It was just me and 24 men.  How are your plans for the E.C.B. to fight climate change different from the past?  I’m not suggesting that the European Central Bank never did anything about climate change. But I think what I’m bringing to the bank is a sense of urgency and a determination to focus on it. The sense of urgency has already led us to setting up a special hub that will bring together representatives from various business areas of the bank to focus on climate change. So instead of climate change being scattered around randomly, depending on who cares for what, we now have a structured approach.  How would you compare the way you manage the governing council or the meetings to your predecessor, Mario Draghi? How do you see your style?  I don’t want to compare myself with Mario Draghi, and I don’t want to compare myself with men in general. But I know after a few years in those jobs that women are more inclusive than mercurial, more patient than impatient, are more respectful than abrasive. As a result, it often takes more time than it would, was I not patient, inclusive and respectful. You know, I was professionally brought up at an international law firm that actually paid as much respect to the vote and to the voice of somebody who came from Jakarta, from Rome, or from New York. And I think that has saved me, and I think it’s more solid at the end of the day.   Finally, we were wondering whether there are women, famous or not, to whom you have turned for advice or guidance, and what is the best piece of advice you have ever received that helped your career, in your assessment?  One person that I used to turn to for guidance and advice was certainly my mother. She was a clear inspiration and a guide for me. What advice did I receive from her or from others? I would say a couple of things. One is from my coach on the national team. She used to say, you know, ‘Grit your teeth and smile,’ that is something that always stayed with me. ‘Don’t let the bastards get you down,” is another one.   "
2020-11-17,Philip R. Lane,Transcript of interview with Portuguese public broadcaster RTP3,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Maria Nobre, broadcast on Tuesday, 17 November at 12:00 a.m. CET","   INTERVIEW  Transcript of interview with Portuguese public broadcaster RTP3   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Maria Nobre, broadcast on Tuesday, 17 November at 12:00 a.m. CET 17 November 2020  How do you think Portugal is doing during this crisis?  We know the global crisis. We know the European crisis and we know that of course those economies which are service-based, those economies which are big producers of tourism, of course are going to be harder hit than those economies which are maybe more manufacturing-based, less dependent on what we call high-contact sectors such as tourism, recreation and entertainment. So in that context, Portugal of course is very much a part of the wider European experience. Some countries have suffered less than others, but from an ECB perspective, the bigger picture is, it's a collective European recession. It's a collective European shock and essentially the monetary policy we're following, I think, is there for all member countries.  So can you tell us how long will it take for Portugal to recover from this crisis?  Well I can tell you what our baseline is, which by the way has been reinforced, I think, by the good news about the initial indicators from the vaccine result. We have since spring taken the view that this is going to take all of next year, all of 2021, for essentially these medical solutions. So whether the vaccine improved the treatment of those who contract the virus, we do think that all of next year there will be interruptions to normal life, but by the end of next year, early 2022, I think there should be a return to normalisation. Even at that point, in early 2022, there is still going to be incomplete recovery. So in our modelling, in our most recent models in September, we took the view it's going to be late 2022 before the European economy has returned to where it was before the pandemic. So at one level, we still have a bridge to close over this year, 18 months before then. So it's that kind of timeline, a year to 18 months, which is at one level still a significant period, but we also can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  You have talked about tourism services, but Portugal has a great deal of small and medium-sized enterprises. Do you think that's also a problem?  So, I think there's a lot of variation across the different industries. So of course, maybe it's interesting to think about this year that we saw in the spring very heavy lockdowns and a lot of disruption to many activities. Then when there is some relaxation there was a fairly good recovery in some sectors, less so in other sectors. So I think it very much depends on business sector, but what is true is individual firms do face a challenge here. The loss of revenue, especially if you're a firm which is in a low-margin industry, is an issue and that's why the low interest rate policy and the credit support policies that we are following, and many governments are following, are important. But let me emphasise again the most important issue for the recovery is whether these economic sectors recover. So in other words, it's not the case that every firm necessarily will survive, but if the sectors in the aggregate recover, then there will also be new opportunities, but I think the prospects for most sectors should be fairly good. It's not the case that this pandemic should permanently damage the economic capacity of Europe or Portugal.  Are Portuguese banks solid enough to face this crisis?  So, I think we always take a pan-European perspective and let me again come back to these basic realities: Number one: the European banking system in general entered this crisis with much higher levels of reserves and capital compared to the last crisis. And it's also the case when we think that there's only another year or year-and-a-half in terms of recovery to go, the challenges for the banking system are much less now compared to the trauma that so many European countries faced in the last crisis. So it's important to accept that there will be challenges for our banking systems across Europe, but also to put into proportion that the challenge on this occasion is not in the same category as the challenges of the last crisis.  In doing a lot of work with the NPLs, do you think we will have this problem to deal with again and because of this crisis?  So, let me again repeat that, yes, it has been the case that there will be some degree of non-performing loans because of the size of this pandemic and recession. On the other hand, the fact that so many countries now have a lot of experience in handling non-performing loans does mean that there is more of a recipe, more of a playbook, more experience now in how to address this. So again, I think it's important that everyone has a good understanding of the size of this challenge. To put it into proportion, there will be non-performing loan challenges across Europe. That's why the supervisors of the European system and the banks themselves, everyone is paying attention, but it is not the core of the economic problem. The core of the economic problem is the pandemic itself. Please remember also, given the very low interest rates, the credit support of the ECB and across Europe a lot of fiscal support - there's a lot of policy reactions. So again, it's important to put this into…  I want to talk about them in a bit. Let me just ask you, how does the pandemic impact public finances?  So what we have here is, again coming back to the most basic point, the pandemic is a large shock, but it's temporary in nature. It's a very different situation when you see countries running large deficits for a year or two of that nature. A short period of large deficits is something I think that can be understood and can be seen as a very correct and natural response to the pandemic emergency. Again, going back to previous crises, the problem with previous crises were, if you like, unresolved fiscal problems. If you have an open-ended fiscal problem then you need some kind of adjustment programme. On this occasion, when the European economy recovers next year or the year after, then a lot of tax revenue will recover and a lot of the temporary support schemes that are in place now will naturally expire. So, if you like, we do think that this is a short period of large deficits. Yes, there will be more public debt at the end of this, but in fact that is the correct response to this type of pandemic emergency.  Do you think our finances are in good shape to deal with this crisis right now?  So again, it's very important to put that into the correct analytical framework, which is when we have a situation when across Europe public debt ratios will go up, but in the context of interest rates that are much lower than 10 or 15 years ago, in the context of predictions of a good recovery in GDP, then the nature of the scale, the dimension of this issue is much more contained. So it's something of course a few years from now, the value of having some fiscal capacity, some spare room in fiscal space if you like, will need to be rebuilt. We know that, but again, let me put this in an entirely different category to the difficult fiscal challenges many European countries faced ten years ago.  Portugal's public debt is around 130 percent GDP, could there be another debt crisis?  So again, I think it's very important to put that in the correct context. Again, let me return to those fundamentals. Across Europe I think this pandemic is much more easily classified as a common general pan-European problem to take on. Across Europe there will be significant increase in public debt, but when you look at the very low interest rates right now, the cost of making the payments on this debt in the years to come will be quite contained. If you look at the market, the market also thinks that this can be handled. There is no reason to believe that this has some kind of intrinsic dynamic that will lead us to a return of the conditions of ten years ago. So I think it's important always to remember this analysis is based on a short number of years of high deficits and as the economy recovers, then the tax revenue comes back, the temporary spending programmes get rolled down and we can return to stabilisation of public finances. So it's going to be an extraordinary period fiscally, no doubt about that, but I think it's important that the correct response to this crisis is significant fiscal support. Yes, there will be more public debt, but in the context of very low interest rates, in the context of the macroeconomic environment, the assessment should be that this is something that is sustainable.  ECB projects eight percent recession this year and five percent growth next year. Within the middle of the second wave, do you think this is realistic with all the restrictions Europe is facing during this second wave?  So I think it's important to take into account that the middle of this year, the summer and early autumn were stronger than we expected. So yes, it looks like the last weeks of this year are going to be worse than expected, but when you average all of that out in terms of the overall 2020 performance, let's see if it makes a big difference to our current projections. I think it's a bit early to tell.  Will there be a correction of these numbers or will they stay the same?  Well we update every three months. So we have numbers in early September. We'll have numbers in early December. So it's too early for us to comment on that now. I'll just say that as a matter of calculation, the fact that the summer and early autumn went better than expected does mean that when you make that revision, there will be for sure some kind of adjustment for this final quarter, but when you add it all up for the performance in 2020, let's see. And then when you think about next year, I think you have to remember probably the assessment now is there may well be more restrictions on social activity in the first part of 2021. On the other hand, to the extent the vaccine gets rolled out over the course of 2021, the overall impact on the speed of recovery which again, as I said to you earlier on, it's going to be some mix of 2021 and 2022. Let's see if there needs to be much change to that general profile. Near term yes, of course near term what it looks like for the rest of November, the rest of December and so on, yes, it's going to look worse than we might have expected, but in terms of the cumulative net impact over the coming months over the next year or so, I think we'll come to that in mid-December around.  Will the euro area have extra support from the ECB in December?  Well you've already heard most recently from President Lagarde, basically giving you the bottom line on this: we know what Europe needs in this period is for the ECB to underpin favourable financing conditions. We know that whether it's for corporates, for households or very importantly right now for governments, that low interest rates, access to credit is so important.   So will the bond buying…?  So we will think about deciding what is needed to deliver that. That's why we say we want to recalibrate our policies in December.  So will the bond-buying programme become a traditional Central Bank tool?  Well I think by the way, globally you've seen all central banks around the world or virtually all central banks doing a lot of quantitative easing right now. So yes, that is the trend in central banking and of course, as you know, we have a strategy review right now which will continue into next year. But again, I think how we choose to deliver favourable financing conditions across our different policies of course it’s interesting and technically important from a central bank point of view, but from the point of view of the real economy, the bigger or the most important message to get across is our intention is to ensure favourable financing conditions. This pandemic is tough enough - we shouldn't add to it by having to deal with some kind of credit freeze, having to deal with rising interest rates. So our orientation is to keep financing conditions favourable.  The ECB has €1.3 billion to buy bonds. Will it be bigger?  So under the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the PEPP, right now the size of that programme is €1.35 trillion, but of course we have other programmes as well. Again, it's not so much the overall number that matters. What matters is are we delivering our objective which is to keep financing conditions favourable? So I don’t think from a point of view of any household, firm or government, the focus should be on some particular number, because what we always say is, we stand ready to adjust. We always will have some kind of plan, some kind of programme, some kind of volume of purchases, but that basically can always be adjusted to deliver what we need to for those favourable financing conditions.  We're running out of time, but I have one more question for you. The ECB aims that inflation rates close to two percent, will this goal change?   Well that's part of the review, but I think it’s fair to say around the world there's a fairly narrow range of choices made by central banks or made by governments. So I think it's too early to give out a final answer. The range of options there remains fairly narrow. So I think there's not going to be any big revolution in that topic. Let's see what we end up with, but behind that it’s really the most important commitment for the ECB is to make sure that whether it's a pandemic, whether it's normal times that we deliver price stability, we support the economy of Europe and we make sure that the central bank is doing its job in support of the European Union.  Thank you for being with us in RTP 3.    "
2020-11-03,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe 3 November 2020  Ms Schnabel, a new wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19), a new lockdown. Will the impact on the economy be a repeat of what we already experienced in the spring?   No, the effects are likely to be less pronounced this time, because the lockdown is more targeted. It is a hard blow to the services sector, but manufacturing is not being shut down and is benefiting from China’s strong recovery. After a surprisingly good third quarter, we will likely see a marked decline in growth at the end of the year.  Are governments doing enough to mitigate the consequences?   Fiscal policy will once again have an important role to play. Germany has already decided on new measures.   Do the decisions taken by governments at European level go far enough? Do we need additional programmes?   What matters now is for the existing programmes to be swiftly implemented. That’s especially true of the EU recovery fund.   Are we looking at a Hamiltonian moment, in other words the first federalisation of European finances, similar to that created by Alexander Hamilton after the founding of the United States?  The European package is a significant step. But it is crucial that these funds are deployed for investments that stimulate growth, such as promoting greener technologies or digitalisation. Otherwise there may even be a pushback for European integration, as the sceptics would then feel vindicated.   The individual euro area countries have been affected very differently by the crisis. Does that jeopardise the euro?   The pandemic has affected euro area countries with varying degrees of severity, depending in part on their economic structures, such as the importance of tourism. And the governments have different amounts of fiscal space with which to respond to the crisis. That is exactly why the European fiscal package, which supports Member States according to the severity of the shock, is so important. Through its pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the ECB is ensuring that our monetary policy is effective in all countries and is contributing to favourable financing conditions. Fiscal and monetary policy have strengthened people’s trust in the euro.   Asset purchases are intended, among other things, to prevent a sharp fall in inflation. Over the past few years, inflation has consistently been lower than projected by the ECB and by many of the world’s other central banks. Why have the projections been so far off the mark?   Many models are based on the assumption that inflation reverts to a long-term average. Structural trends such as demographic change or global shocks like the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic are difficult to capture in these models.   What do you mean exactly?   After the financial crisis, people underestimated how prolonged the downward effect of such a shock on inflation would be. The pandemic could give rise to a similar problem. We don’t have much data from the past to rely on. Moreover, inflation projections are frequently reported merely as point estimates. The projections are, however, subject to great uncertainty – especially in the current situation.   The PEPP was envisaged as a temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed for one at preventing a slide in inflation. But if the pandemic dampens inflation over the very long term, wouldn’t the PEPP have to continue for many years too?  No. The PEPP was expressly created because of the pandemic. After the crisis we must at some point fall back on our regular toolbox in order to bring inflation to a rate consistent with our price stability definition. But we’re still a long way off from that.   Even if the crisis pushes down inflation for a longer period?  Within the PEPP, there is a net purchase phase, in which we purchase additional assets, and a reinvestment phase, in which we keep the portfolio at a steady level by replacing maturing securities. I can imagine that the long-term effects would be taken into account when determining the length of the reinvestment phase, for example.   But wouldn’t it be possible to transfer the flexibility of the PEPP to other programmes?   We have not discussed that within the ECB’s Governing Council.   The ECB intends to review the deployment of all its monetary policy instruments by December. Could this result in a completely different mix than in the spring?   Before every monetary policy decision we ask ourselves which measures would be the most appropriate in the given situation. The current situation differs from that in March and that will presumably be reflected in the calibration of the instruments. The main concern at that time was to stabilise financial markets. By contrast, today’s financing conditions are very favourable in historical comparison.   So would a further lowering of the deposit rate for banks, which currently stands at -0.5%, now be conceivable?   Our analyses show that a further reduction would be possible without reaching the point at which it no longer works or even causes harm. But no decisions have been taken in this regard. For each decision, we analyse its effectiveness, whether it is proportionate and what side effects it has. This assessment of proportionality is a constant component of our decision-making.  Do the banks perhaps need even more support? It is, after all, foreseeable that there may be more insolvencies and thus also more loan defaults.  So far in this crisis, banks have been part of the solution and not the problem. They have helped to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Part of the risk is currently absorbed by state guarantees, but we can expect an increase in non-performing loans in future. We are concerned that, according to surveys, some banks are tightening their credit standards. We are keeping a close eye on that. The economic downturn must not be further exacerbated by the banking sector.  Many savers are annoyed about the low interest rates. The ECB argues that these are necessary in order to push the current very low inflation towards the objective of 2%. Why don’t you use simple, understandable arguments? For example, that you want to tackle unemployment?  We regularly point out that our monetary policy supports economic development and the creation of jobs by improving financing conditions for businesses and households. However, under the EU Treaties the primary mandate of the ECB is to maintain price stability. As a secondary mandate we have the task of supporting economic policy in the EU – provided this does not jeopardise price stability.  This brings into play EU objectives such as full employment and combating climate change.  Often the objectives of the EU are in harmony with the objective of price stability. In the case of an acute lack of demand, for example, an expansionary monetary policy helps to keep prices stable and at the same time alleviates unemployment. The question of how we best communicate this will definitely play a role in the currently ongoing review of our monetary policy strategy.  And what happens if the objectives are contradictory?  Then price stability takes precedence, but we have a certain amount of flexibility because we aim to achieve our primary objective over the medium term. Thus we can react somewhat more cautiously in order to mitigate the effects on employment.  If the ECB is supposed to support the general economic objectives of the EU, shouldn’t it be more closely aligned with the policy of the European Parliament?  We are observers of politics. Within our mandate we have some room for manoeuvre in weighing up which secondary objectives we can pursue alongside price stability, and how strongly. We are in regular dialogue with the European Parliament, but we do not take instructions.  Why then do you justify combating climate change on the grounds that it has an influence on prices? On that basis, all kinds of other areas could also be defined as tasks of the ECB. For example, demographic change must have some kind of influence on prices.  We can hardly influence demographic change while, in the transition of the economy to climate neutrality, banks and capital markets play a decisive role. As a banking supervisor and key player in financial markets, we cannot avoid giving serious consideration to what role we can play.  But how large is this influence? Are you not raising expectations that are much too high?  We have always stressed that it is governments that are primarily responsible for climate policy. The key to this is making CO2 emissions sufficiently expensive, ideally globally. We cannot conduct climate policy, but we can support it.  But how, exactly?  There are many areas, and some of them are uncontroversial. For example, we must take the risks of climate change – and climate policy – and their effects on monetary policy better into account in our models. These risks also have an impact on banking supervision and financial stability.  Can you give an example?  If, for example, energy production that is harmful to the climate is banned or made very expensive, the corresponding investments diminish in value. That affects the assessment of bank loans, but also the question of what securities we can accept as collateral for ECB loans and what haircuts we demand.  Far more contentious, however, are the questions of whether the ECB should take climate considerations into account when purchasing bonds, and what criteria should be applied.  The EU is currently developing criteria and this taxonomy should be ready for use by 2022. However, it should not be forgotten that initially this would only concern corporate bonds, while we primarily purchase government bonds. In any case, climate criteria could certainly be taken more into account.  So, in the end, what will the climate strategy of the ECB look like?  That is exactly what will be discussed in the strategy review. Until now no decisions have been made on that. However, many agree that we must live up to our responsibility.  Central bankers often claim that they are not responsible at all for the low interest rates, but were simply following a major trend in the real economy which is determined by, among other things, the increasing ageing of the population and thus a great need to save. But how sure are you that the central bank is not depressing real interest rates at least in part?  This question is subject to dispute among academics. However, it is widely acknowledged that the trend towards low interest rates, in large part, was not caused by monetary policy. This development is far more dependent on an economy’s innovative strength and growth capacity. Those are long-term processes that we can hardly influence. Our task as a central bank is to stimulate or dampen demand in the economy in such a way that people can rely on price stability.     "
2020-10-19,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Le Monde,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel and Eric Albert","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Le Monde   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel and Eric Albert 19 October 2020  With the pandemic getting worse, many countries are introducing new restrictions. Against this backdrop, what are your fears for the European economy?  The second wave of the pandemic in Europe, notably in France, and the resulting new restrictions are adding to the uncertainty and weighing on the recovery. Since the rebound we saw over the summer, the recovery has been uneven, uncertain and incomplete and now risks losing momentum. We will keep a close watch on indicators throughout the autumn. Our central scenario foresees euro area GDP declining by an average of 8% in 2020 and assumes partial and localised containment measures. If the situation deteriorates, our projections, which we will revise in December, will obviously be gloomier.  Back in March, some people were hoping that the pandemic would be a short-lived shock. That is not the case. What long-term scars might this crisis leave behind?  Job losses are the most serious. They pose a risk for the social fabric, household income, demand and growth. Governments in the euro area need to be extremely mindful of this. We think it’s essential that the fiscal safety nets that governments put in place during this crisis are not withdrawn too soon.  In response to the slowdown in activity, the ECB launched asset purchases amounting to more than €1.5 trillion, which is unprecedented. If the crisis gets worse, what more will it be able to do?   The options in our toolbox have not been exhausted. If more has to be done, we will do more. On taking up my position, I was told that there was nothing left for me to do, that everything had been done. But that was clearly not the case! We have found ways to stabilise the markets and support the euro area economy. Thanks to the action we took between March and June, we estimate that growth will be 1.3 percentage points higher overall, and inflation 0.8 percentage points higher. According to the ECB’s assessment, we have saved one million jobs in the euro area. So we have acted, and our action has been effective.  The pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP for short, which was launched in March, has effectively calmed the markets. But does it actually support the real economy?   The PEPP has a dual objective: first, to stabilise the markets, and this objective has been fulfilled; next, to help bring inflation back to its pre-pandemic path, while keeping interest rates low and ensuring that these low rates are passed on to the real economy, which has worked. Our market actions, in tandem with our programme of long-term loans to the real economy – the well-known targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) – have enabled lending to continue at very low rates. Lending rates for households and firms are around 1.4% to 1.5%. In the euro area, the volume of lending has increased by 7% for firms and 3% for households.  Central banks have been taking action for the past ten years and still need to do more. Why is their action becoming less and less effective?  After the crisis of 2008, fiscal policy was not forthcoming. Central banks were working very much in isolation. This was particularly true in the euro area. But we are now in a different paradigm. Fiscal support is playing its part and is working hand in hand with monetary support. This is unprecedented and will be effective.  In July, Europe agreed on an unprecedented joint recovery plan of €750 billion. Did you have a say in setting the amount?   As of a meeting of the Eurogroup in April, I had been stressing the need for a plan that is substantial, quick and flexible, but at the same time targeted at the countries and sectors that need it the most. According to our assessment, that corresponded to an envelope of between €1 trillion and €1.5 trillion. If you take into account the €540 billion of the first emergency package agreed by the Eurogroup – which included support for the provision of loans to firms, the short-time work schemes (the SURE plan), and the additional financing via the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – and the €750 billion of the recovery plan approved by the European Council on 21 July, you could say we’ve reached that amount.  Given the urgency of the crisis, isn’t there a risk that these €750 billion are allocated too late?  The Commission’s aim is to be able to distribute these funds at the beginning of 2021, and this timeline must be kept. The ball is in the court of the national governments, who have to present their recovery plans – some of which are already ready – and of the Commission, which will have to examine them carefully but quickly. We also need rapid progress on the political side, in particular the adoption of the measures by national parliaments. It is vital that this extraordinary plan, which has broken significant taboos in certain countries, is a success. If it is not targeted, if it gets lost in an administrative labyrinth and does not support the real economy in reorienting our countries to be more digital and green, we will have missed a historic opportunity to make a real difference.  The parallel interventions of the ECB and national governments enabled us to avoid a financial crisis. But if these difficulties continue, do we risk seeing a resurgence of fears that the euro area will implode?   I will repeat the words of my predecessor: the euro is irreversible. Additionally, the €750 billion recovery plan – collective borrowing that represents 5% of EU GDP – is a major turning point for Europe. It has changed things completely. We now have an additional tool at our disposal, even if it is something of an exception. National governments have shown that, if the situation demands it, there is clearly a will to work together in solidarity. Having more than 50% of the €750 billion in the form of grants for the countries and sectors that have been hit hardest is truly innovative.  Does the euro area finally have the beginnings of the budget it always lacked, to go alongside monetary policy?  This recovery plan tool is a response to an extraordinary situation. We should discuss the possibility of it remaining in the European toolbox so it could be used again if similar circumstances arise. I hope that there will also be a debate about a common budgetary tool for the euro area, and that it will be enriched by our current experience.  Such a debate will be tricky: some countries, like the Netherlands, already had strong concerns about the recovery plan…  This sort of opposition is not at all surprising: that’s how Europe works. During the last crisis too, at the height of concerns, it took time to set up the ESM. For many governments, acknowledging that a collective response is the right response to a common shock takes time.  Governments have taken on huge amounts of debt during this crisis; debt that has been purchased by the ECB. Some economists are calling for this debt to be cancelled. Is that possible?  Article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU forbids the ECB from financing the budgets of Member States, pure and simple. Debt cancellation would be exactly that. Breaking European Treaties is not on my road map.  1 November will mark one year since you took up your post. What has surprised you the most?  The severity of the shock. I experienced the 2008 crisis: between the summer of 2007 and the summer of 2008, problems increased gradually. There were signs that the crisis was coming, of stress in the financial system. This time, the speed and the scale of the shock were unprecedented.  At what point did you become aware of the scale of this crisis?  At the Governing Council meeting on 12 March, we decided to increase our asset purchases by €120 billion. As the situation was deteriorating between 16 and 18 March, we worked relentlessly and under lots of pressure to prepare the decision about the PEPP that was eventually taken during the night of 18 March. I spent that day on the phone to my staff from my dining room in Frankfurt, as we were all in lockdown at that point. Then in the evening all 25 members of the Governing Council met by teleconference. We had to act quickly and decisively. It was a collective decision: “We go big, or we go home!” At 23:30 we published a press release announcing our extraordinary €750 billion purchase programme.  With its reputation as an austere country, Germany’s support for the recovery plan financed by shared borrowing came as a surprise. Is this a substantial change?  This transformation came at just the right moment. Faced with such a severe crisis, Europe had to seriously reconsider its approach to issues related to balancing the budget, debt and state intervention. There was also a realisation that we were all in the same boat: if already weakened economies were to become even weaker, stronger economies would suffer too.  The ECB is considering creating a digital euro. Is this to support growth or to address geopolitical issues such as the emergence of a digital yuan?  It’s simply a matter of making our currency fit for the digital age. When we see how quickly digital payments are spreading, especially among young people, it’s important to meet this demand. If the digital euro were to see the light of day, it would not replace banknotes. It would be a complement to them. If we can have a means of payment that is more efficient, costs less, causes less pollution, can be used as easily as cash, protects privacy while ensuring traceability, reduces the cost of transferring money between countries and strengthens the international role of the euro, we would be remiss not to study it! That’s what we are doing at the ECB by starting to experiment and by launching our public consultation on the digital euro.  Should the ECB contribute to the ecological transition?  It’s a fundamental issue, and I am going to try to encourage the Governing Council to at least agree to reflect on what a central bank can legitimately do to contribute to the fight against climate change. I am aware that some commentators have their doubts. Very well, it’s something we will debate. But we must take climate issues into account because they have an impact on price stability, our primary mandate. Everybody must step up to address what is the main risk of the 21st century. If we don’t do so now, it will no longer be possible for us to tackle climate change. It will be too late! Every one of us, no matter where we are, would be to blame if we didn’t ask ourselves: what do I need to do to play my part? What can I do? My instinct tells me that we can do more than we think.   "
2020-10-17,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Kathimerini,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eirini Chrysolora","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Kathimerini   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eirini Chrysolora 17 October 2020  The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) has so far secured low interest rate borrowing, especially for countries in need such as Italy and Greece. What do you expect to happen regarding the bonds of these countries when the programme ends? Are you worried that they will fall off a cliff?   The pandemic has driven the euro area economy into its deepest economic downturn. The GDP contraction hit double digits in the second quarter, with disinflationary effects. The ECB has therefore taken decisive measures to protect productive capacity and stabilise markets, providing favourable financing conditions for all economic sectors throughout the euro area. This, in turn, has sustained the flow of financing to households and firms, supporting aggregate demand and avoiding a more pronounced fall in inflation.  But we need to continuously monitor the evolution of the pandemic and its economic implications. The resurgence of infections we are seeing in a number of euro area countries is weakening the recovery, especially in the services sector, where the business activity index contracted in September.  This reinforces the need for prolonged economic support from macroeconomic policies. The ECB will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021, and in any case until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis phase is over. We will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. And any subsequent roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will have to be managed to avoid interfering with monetary policy. In any case, we will not allow any tightening of financing conditions that gets in the way of our aim.   Is there a possibility that the PEPP will be extended beyond June 2021? Could its size be increased beyond €1.35 trillion?   The key driver of economic developments is the evolution of the pandemic, which is depressing investment and consumption. According to European Commission survey data, in September euro area households’ savings intentions stood at their highest level on record since the start of the series in 2000. The current pandemic developments are not positive. On top of the direct impact on spending, uncertainty is likely to increase significantly, with adverse effects on both the economic outlook and the balance of risks. Both actual inflation and expected inflation are already too low. In September the euro area headline inflation rate was negative for the second month in a row (-0.3%), while inflation excluding the volatile energy and food components was 0.2%. ECB staff have projected that inflation will rise to only 1.3% in 2022, but the most recent inflation data show that there is a risk of inflation dynamics being weaker than projected. Market-based inflation expectations are subdued, and consumers’ inflation expectations have also declined continuously since April. In view of the sheer size of the downside risks, there should not be any doubt about our determination to preserve price stability. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to achieve our objective of bringing inflation back to our medium-term aim in a sustained manner. During the pandemic we have already adjusted some of our instruments, and this has proven to be effective.   Do you feel that the ECB has once again done more than its share during this crisis? Will monetary policy be able to return to normal after such extensive quantitative easing?   The monetary policy and fiscal policy responses have been essential to protect households and businesses during the crisis, thereby facilitating the necessary public health response.  The mistakes that have characterised past episodes have been avoided. Monetary policy and fiscal policy reacted rapidly to the shock and have mutually reinforced each other. Together, monetary policy and fiscal policy have increased confidence. A shy policy attitude at the present juncture would have the opposite effect. Our bank lending survey suggests that banks would tighten credit standards considerably if public loan guarantee schemes were not maintained. This could make otherwise viable companies and creditworthy households insolvent. Similar consequences could emerge from a tightening of financial conditions. The only way to normalise monetary policy in the future is to forcefully support the economy now.  Does the Federal Reserve’s change in inflation-targeting pressure the ECB to follow a more accommodative policy?   Our own strategy review is under way and will be an important focus for our work over the next year. Its aim is to make sure our monetary policy strategy is fit for purpose, both today and in the future.  Some global developments that the Federal Reserve has taken into account in its review are also relevant to our current monetary policy. In particular, the marked decline of the “natural” rate of interest – i.e. the rate at which the monetary policy stance is neutral – observed in advanced economies complicates the task of monetary policy, as it reduces the scope for conducting expansionary policy through rate cuts. This has three key implications.  First, it should reduce our tolerance for inflation drifting downwards away from our aim and prompt us to treat our inflation aim as perfectly symmetric. Second, the instruments we have activated in recent years – such as asset purchases and targeted lending to banks – have been key to containing the risk of deflation and should remain in our toolbox; this would have a stabilising effect and reduce the probability that we have to use those instruments again in the future. And third, it indicates that in extreme situations, such as when interest rates are close to the lower bound, it is essential that fiscal and monetary policy reinforce each other.   To what extent does the €750 billion Next Generation EU (NGEU) package facilitate the ECB’s monetary policy?   NGEU can significantly improve the future path of the European economy. The mere announcement of the recovery fund has contributed to a further decline in fragmentation and supporting sentiment. But now we need to activate NGEU quickly and use it for productive spending – in other words, to finance investment in a context of growth-enhancing reforms. It is crucial that the funds become available in early 2021, to avoid any fiscal cliff effects. And that the resources are allocated to the sectors that can be powerful drivers of growth in the long term. The link between recovery funding and reforms will further empower the multipliers associated with the recovery spending.   How long do you think it will take for the European economy to return to pre-coronavirus levels? What should Europe’s priorities be in this process?   In the first half of the year euro area GDP declined by 15%, and according to the latest ECB staff projections it will return to pre-crisis levels only by the end of 2022. However, the return to more stringent containment measures that we are observing in a number of euro area countries may push this horizon even further away.  Moreover, there is a risk that a slow recovery will exacerbate divergences across sectors and countries: the longer it takes to return to pre-crisis levels, the greater the impact on divergence and inequality. The European fiscal policy response mitigates this risk, but it cannot eliminate it. We need to quickly return to growth.  How could Greek bonds become eligible under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), and not only under the PEPP, given that they are still not investment grade?   The PSPP follows a clear set of rules about the eligibility of marketable debt securities and implementation modalities; based on the minimum rating requirements, Greek government bonds are not currently eligible for the programme. But we intervened to fight the effects of the COVID-19 crisis with a variety of instruments. The inclusion of Greek government bonds in the PEPP has stabilised financing conditions in Greece. The Greek ten-year sovereign bond yield has dropped markedly since the start of the PEPP, and currently stands at 0.8%, i.e. below pre-pandemic levels.  Greece, an already heavily indebted country, will be burdened with additional debt by the pandemic. Will its debt be sustainable?   Greece has a high debt burden, but the maturity of its debt is very long and the cost of debt servicing continues to be low, as also indicated by the successful recent issuances. The preliminary debt sustainability assessments by the European Commission on the eligibility of euro area countries for the European Stability Mechanism’s Pandemic Crisis Support concluded that Greece’s debt is sustainable. Measures adopted by the Greek authorities, as well as those agreed with the European Commission, will have to support the recovery of the Greek economy, allowing debt ratios to abate over time. Looking beyond the short term – where fiscal policy has to manage the impact of the crisis – it is crucial that all resources are devoted to increasing the Greek economy’s growth potential and that appropriate investments are accompanied by reforms which support potential growth and long-term debt sustainability.   How do you think the problem of higher non-performing loan (NPL) ratios due to the pandemic crisis should be addressed? In particular, will Greece, which already had a large stock of NPLs before the pandemic, be able to deal effectively with the problem with “Hercules” [the Greek asset protection scheme] or will it need to take additional measures? The Governor of the Bank of Greece has already proposed establishing an asset management company as a next step, a proposal which seems to be viewed positively by the OECD.   The Greek banking sector had an average NPL ratio of 36.7% in the second quarter of 2020. Such high levels of NPLs weigh on banks’ solvency and profitability. This, in turn, hampers banks’ ability to provide new credit to the economy, with negative consequences for economic growth.  The Hercules asset protection scheme will continue to contribute to sustainable NPL disposals and support Greek banks’ efforts to achieve more sustainable NPL levels in the medium term. Nevertheless, even with these accelerated NPL disposals, the resulting NPL levels of Greek significant institutions are likely to remain far above the average for banks under European banking supervision. Against this background, all avenues for NPL reduction need to be examined. First of all, financial sector reforms should facilitate the process of NPL reduction. Further potential additions to the NPL resolution toolkit should also be thoroughly analysed. The ECB is cooperating closely with all relevant stakeholders on these issues, including the Bank of Greece.   The Greek government recently published its proposal for the new bankruptcy framework, the so-called Debt Settlement and Second Chance Code. What are your views on it? Is it satisfactory? Would it help to put an end to the phenomenon of strategic defaults and restore the payment culture in Greece?   We are currently preparing our formal opinion on this topic. The ECB has had very constructive discussions with the Greek authorities about this major reform. Work is still ongoing on both primary and secondary legislation and on the IT infrastructure, as a significant number of the foreseen processes are envisaged to be conducted electronically. It is crucial that the reform increases the effectiveness of judicial and non-judicial procedures, improves the efficiency of bankruptcy proceedings and simplifies their procedural requirements, and strengthens the payment culture.

2020-10-11,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Wall Street Journal,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tom Fairless on 8 October","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Wall Street Journal   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tom Fairless on 8 October 11 October 2020  What’s your latest thinking on the economic outlook for the eurozone? Do you see the risk of a double-dip recession?  The usual language we use for how the economy is performing is not so helpful this year. When the economy was locked down in March and April there was a really big drop in activity, but it was an enforced drop. We published on 1 May a set of simulations, and broadly the baseline there has been working. The baseline had a big drop in the second quarter and an elastic bounceback in the third quarter, and that has worked out. The narrative was that the fourth quarter would not be a dip, but it would be a slowdown.  What is true is that the next phase is going to be tougher. We think that about half of the drop has already been recovered. We also think there is going to be more in the fourth quarter. By the end of the year, the European economy is going to be still about 5 percentage points below its end-2019 level. That’s a lot less than the 15 percentage points the economy was down in the second quarter, but a 5 percentage point drop is still a lot. Our baseline is still a lot of recovery in the fourth quarter, a lot of recovery next year, with the elimination of the whole gap in 2022. But the situation now does feel different because it’s no longer just reliant on the elasticity of reopening the economy. It does rely on whether there are going to be more localised lockdowns, which are happening to some extent. And it does depend on what is going to be the behaviour of consumers and investors, and what is fiscal policy going to look like.  We had in our baseline that there would be temporary outbreaks and temporary resurgences, because the nature of the pandemic is that you do get waves. It’s not too surprising that there's some pick-up in the virus right now. The big question, and this is why there is so much uncertainty, is: how quickly can the current dynamic, with rising cases, be stabilised.  The approach to addressing the virus is now much more surgical. It tends to be shutting down the entertainment sector and restaurants, but not shutting down factories, not shutting down schools and so on. If it's shown that you can control the virus with serious but not universal restrictions, then that's more or less in line with our baseline. If it turns out we have to really disrupt the economy more materially in order to control the pandemic, then that’s more of a negative development.  A lot of businesses have been disrupted for six months, is there some damage that the economy has sustained from that that we’re likely to see going forward?  This is one of the big issues. It relates to the very extensive fiscal support. The loss of revenue for many firms has been offset to some extent because some of their cost base, in particular the wage bill, has been partly taken over by the state. And then you have the ability to obtain liquidity because of credit guarantee schemes that have been quite important as well. All of that makes more sense when the period of lost revenue is relatively contained.  The question whether there is longer-lasting damage to the economy is part of the uncertainty that remains. If it turns out that most of the economy can operate as normal most of the time, there is less fear of long-term damage than if there is going to be more extensive interruption of activity. But you definitely have sectors like travel, tourism, the entertainment sector, where there is probably quite a lot of damage. The dominant issue here is not at macro level, how the whole economy and aggregate productivity might be affected, but for those sectors that are the most vulnerable to the crisis, definitely a lot of support will be needed for them.  Do you see the risk of a wave of job cuts?  So far there hasn’t been a huge amount of permanent job losses. There’s been short-time working and a lot of retention of workers, or in some cases they may become unemployed and be rehired. Going back to the deterioration of the lockdown and the interruption to travel and tourism, there is a reasonable concern about whether firms will survive and whether people's job prospects will be damaged. We do think that is one reason why the savings rate is not going to return to normal super quickly, because it makes sense in that environment to have some precautionary savings. The fear of losing your job, which in conditions of uncertainty is going to be elevated, is a real issue.  Probably the most important thing to say about our view of the economy is that there is a high degree of uncertainty. We publish not just our baseline but also mild and severe scenarios and each of those scenarios is self-validating. If good news emerges that the pandemic can be contained, that there is better treatment, ultimately a vaccine, then the good news takes hold and that uncertainty will fade and there are a lot of savings in bank accounts that can go back into the economy. Alternatively, if bad news arrives then the support for consumption and investment will be a lot weaker. So the uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of what we have right now.  Do you see signs of a K-shaped recovery in which some classes of workers will do better than others?  That correlates quite strongly with the sectors. We know that the sectors most affected are labour-intensive service sectors like restaurants, hotels, travel, tourism. Those sectors employ a lot of younger people and these are overall not the best paid sectors in the economy. That can feed into macro outcomes because those classes of workers, by and large, have a much higher consumption propensity than those that are higher paid, who will have more of a savings margin. This is why it’s so important that the fiscal measures to support the categories of workers in the sectors more exposed to the pandemic are maintained.  Will the jobs that have been washed away in this crisis come back, or do you expect a shift in the European economy toward new sectors and types of jobs?  In terms of the return of tourism – going back to restaurants and so on – once we’re past the pandemic, I don't see a reason why those sectors wouldn’t fully recover. In fact, you could argue that after a long period of time of not having the same level of entertainment, not having the same level of tourism, there will be maybe more of a strong bounceback after the pandemic. For business travel, and the balance between working from home or the office, maybe there’s going to be more long-term consequences. But maybe some of that was going to happen anyway and it's just been accelerated by the pandemic. And the acceleration of digitisation that we’ve seen may well be good for productivity over the longer term.  What risks do you see to the economic outlook? How concerning is the exchange rate of the euro?  The single biggest risk is that the pandemic is not controlled, and/or it takes longer than is currently expected to find good treatments and a vaccine. That outranks any other risk by some distance. What we haven’t seen in this crisis is the amplification of the crisis by financial instability and credit crunch issues and so on. The fact that there has been a good degree of policy responsiveness this year, it's important to maintain that, because we would have had worse outcomes this year without a good deal of policy support. And I think that's going to remain true until the pandemic is really vanquished. The most important driver of inflation dynamics is the amount of slack in the economy. When we’re operating, in the second quarter, at 15 percentage points below 2019 levels, only half of that has been offset by now, and we’ll have a 5 percentage point gap by the end of 2020, that is by far the biggest issue for inflation. On top of that we have had the movement in oil prices, and in addition to that the exchange rate does matter. So the exchange rate is important for the European economy, there is no doubt about that. But there's a lot going on at the moment and it's important not to put that at the centre of policymaking, because it's not. The exchange rate does matter, but it's only one of the issues that we think about. It's there, but it's only one of many factors. It's also not so much that the central bank is looking at the exchange rate per se, it's the implications for the European economy and for inflation. The exchange rate is one issue, but the fact that there's been a significant recovery in the Chinese economy is quite important. The fact that, by and large, the world economy is looking better than it did a few months ago is quite important. The fact that there's been a lot of policy support, not just in the advanced economies but also in the emerging economies, is important. The fact that European manufacturing, by and large, is open, is busy now, is important. So the exchange rate is important but the bigger global issue is the state of global demand, and that has recovered maybe better than expected.  Is the exchange rate a problem at its current level?  Again, it’s not the level. What enters the dynamic calculations is the movement in the exchange rate. That’s really what matters. And in turn it’s the implications of that, not on a month-by-month basis but over the next couple of years. So it’s something we’re looking at, but there’s so much going on in the world right now, it’s just one of many factors. And compared with the core issue, which is the pandemic itself, it in no way ranks in the same category as that.  Given that inflation is so low and there’s a large amount of slack in the economy, are investors correct to assume that, all else equal, the ECB will announce another round of bond purchases?  We understand why inflation is slightly negative right now. It’s clear that there are some purely temporary factors behind it. In Germany, for instance, there has been a temporary VAT cut. That has quite a big impact on the price level, but that is going to be reversed on 1 January. Another factor is that the European economy will operate on average this year at 8 percentage points below the 2019 level. That’s a huge amount of slack, so it’s not surprising that we have very low or slightly negative inflation in these months.  But for next year we are projecting the economy to grow by 5 percent. The European economy doesn’t normally grow by 5 percent, so we know there’s going to be a lot of reduction in slack next year. And this is why we do think that inflation is going to climb. What is true is that the current inflation level remains far away from our goal. We don’t think that is a satisfactory inflation outlook. But a lot is going on this autumn – in terms of the pandemic and in terms of fiscal policy. When we made our September forecast we didn’t know what the budget plans for 2021 were going to be. There’s going to be a lot of budgets announced in the next few weeks. Then we will know more about how much fiscal support there will be for the economy in 2021. We also have to see in these weeks what’s happening with the exchange rate, and with oil prices. We’re going to get a lot of information.  Some of those factors may represent negative developments, but some factors may be positive. There’s a lot of two-sided uncertainty, but we know some of that uncertainty will be resolved this autumn. We will know the fiscal plans, we will know more about the pandemic. So I think it’s true to say that we would like to see a stronger momentum in inflation. Meeting by meeting we will have to make that call: where do we think inflation is going? Because if the outlook remains at 1.3 percent, that is far away from our goal.  So that does suggest that, all else equal, you would need to do more stimulus?  That depends on the incoming data. It is clear that 1.3 percent is not our goal. More than usually the incoming data will tell us a lot. Right now, there’s a lot to learn in these weeks. It was always clear that there was going to be a pivot in the recovery, because the initial bounceback was mechanical in the third quarter. Now, the pace of the recovery will depend on the pandemic dynamics, on the behaviour of households in terms of consumption, on the behaviour of firms in terms of investment. It becomes more of a question of economic analysis. It really is a unique period of uncertainty. But along some dimensions the uncertainty will diminish in the autumn because we’ll know more about the outlook for 2021.  So December’s meeting could be important?  I wouldn't focus on any one meeting. It’s not the case that we only look at the formal projection rounds.  Major central banks have avoided cutting interest rates deeper into negative territory, or cutting below zero. Does that show a certain scepticism towards negative interest rates?  We still think that the pandemic will be mostly a temporary shock. We do think that the impact of the pandemic on GDP will be mostly gone by 2022. So there’s maybe an 18-month horizon compared to now. Any interest rate cut typically lasts for a long time. Typically, it’s not just that you cut the overnight rate, but that the market infers that the rate cut will be there for a long time, so the whole yield curve moves.  When you have an expectation of a strong movement in the economy over a relatively short period of time, then the implications of a short-term rate cut in the yield curve are going to be less, because the conditions that might cause you to cut rates now are less likely to persist for so long. The value of a rate cut is still there and we look at it all the time. It’s perpetually looked at. We reject the idea that we are at the lower bound. We think, overall, a rate cut would still be working the way other rate cuts have worked. The economics of a rate cut remain. We think the rate cuts up to now, including last September’s, have worked in the way intended; they pass through into lower lending rates, into more credit volumes and so on. In terms of effectiveness, we think the asset purchases have a bigger impact on the yield curve now. But the option of going lower remains part of our policy guidance.  Is the ECB’s strategy review likely to come to a similar conclusion to the Federal Reserve, which recently indicated it will target an average inflation rate of 2 percent?  All advanced economy central banks have a high degree of commonality in the issues they face, especially: how do you conduct monetary policy when the underlying global equilibrium real rate, r*, has trended downwards? In addition, we all – to different degrees – are below where we would like to be in terms of the inflation rate. One of the issues is whether the sustained period of low inflation might get locked into inflation expectations.  In terms of our monetary policy strategy review, it’s important that our medium-term orientation is to get inflation back to where we think it should be. For us to be back at around 2 percent, that’s not going to happen this year or next year. So then a key question is: how do you anchor expectations? One version of how you might anchor expectations is the new formulation of the Fed. But there’s a whole family of different ways of doing this. Our current forward guidance has a lot of guidance there. The main concern raised with us is: please tell me you’re committed, that your monetary policy is committed to get inflation back towards the aim. Our monetary policy today, even before the strategy review, says that we’re not going to tighten the interest rate until we see inflation robustly converge to the aim. In other words, we need to see a lot of evidence that the inflation outlook is in the neighbourhood of the aim. And we have a second condition: that we’ve seen that robust convergence reflected in realised inflation dynamics. It’s not just that we’re forecasting two years from now that inflation is going to pick up, but that we’ve already seen a good pickup in underlying inflation. So there’s a lot of similarity between our current forward guidance and that family of policies which all say: we’re not going to have knee-jerk policy tightening, we’re going to make sure that inflation is in the neighbourhood of where we want it to be before we tighten.  Mario Draghi suggested that the ECB’s policy target was symmetrical. Is that accepted by the Governing Council?  How can you doubt that? We have emphasised this in our introductory statement for at least over a year now. All the action we’ve taken since 2014 was in order to respond to inflation that was dropping below the target. There would be asymmetry if anyone was concerned that the ECB would quickly suppress inflation that went above the aim but tolerate below-target inflation so long as it was above zero and below two.  But the evidence shows that we’ve been very symmetric, that we’ve done a lot since 2014 to respond to the fact that inflation has been too low. So in that sense it is a symmetric target. Part of the strategy review is how else can we communicate and have a better common understanding of what is meant by symmetry. So we say we’re symmetric, and I think the record shows we’ve been symmetric. But to fully understand what that means will be part of the strategy review.   Investors seem to perceive that the Fed might be more aggressive than the ECB in pursuing its target.  Anyone who pays attention to our policies and forward guidance knows that we will not tighten policy without inflation solidly appearing in the data. I do not see that the ECB has a structurally tighter orientation for monetary policy.   European nations like Spain and Italy have very high and rising public debt. Does the level of debt still matter? Should governments aim to reduce their debts at some point?  It’s important to make a sharp distinction between sovereign debt and other types of debt in the economy. We’ve seen the damage that can occur when an economy is made very vulnerable by debt. But a lot of those examples have both high sovereign debt and large external debt. It’s important to make a distinction between that example and what we have now in Europe. We see an increase in public debt, but we are not seeing economies running a high current account deficit.  The eurozone as a whole is running a current account surplus. Simultaneously, household savings are extremely high at the moment. The fact that the sovereign may have increased its debt is macroeconomically necessary given the situation. But also in terms of the longer-term consequences, it’s a very different scenario to having a lot of sovereign debt twinned with a lot of net external debt. Under current conditions it’s important that fiscal policy is active and responds to the needs of the economy. We think the maximum hit to the economy is this year, but there will still be below-normal operations next year. So it’s important to have a lot of fiscal support next year, but it’s going to be obviously directionally less than this year. But a lot of these measures are temporary in nature. We have had problems in the past because the fiscal deficit was structural in nature and you needed to have a lot of adjustment, spending cuts and tax rises, to close it. In the current context a lot of the work will be done by the recovery in the economy.  This pandemic might last for a sustained period, but it is temporary. Once this is over, debt ratios will be a lot higher in Europe. And at that point it will be important to think about what kind of policy frameworks will not only stabilise the debt ratio but also bring it down over time. Because one other lesson from this crisis is that it shows the value of fiscal space. If you want to have a suitably countercyclical fiscal policy when shocks happen, you have to create some room in the good years, when the European economy has recovered. So we will want to see debt ratios come down to some extent. That message has to be there. The calculation of what that looks like, I think, can wait.  It is also worth taking into account that the trend interest rate has come down, because of the policy support we have put in place and also the cyclical slump in investment demand combined with cyclically high savings ratios. There’s also a cyclical component to the low interest rate environment. Governments can take advantage of the fact that the trend interest rate is lower than it was 20 years ago. It’s still important that the debt ratio comes down, but a growing economy can do a lot.  Do you think the 60% debt-to-GDP level outlined in the EU Treaty is still important?  It’s in the EU treaty. In economic terms, the most important issue is having debt ratios come to a safe level over time. The calculation of that level will depend on the country and will probably also depend on the time horizon you’re looking at. Debt ratios over time should return to a safe level, but let me emphasise that the dominant interpretation of “safe” should be “macroeconomically safe”. This means governments can respond to another shock with countercyclical measures. There would be macroeconomic risk in leaving debt ratios at too high a level.  Is there a risk that the ECB finds it can’t change its policies in future because government debt ratios are so high?  Right now we have this accommodative monetary policy, because we think the European economy is operating below potential and it needs monetary support to recover. We have signalled the conditions needed for our policy to tighten once the economy has recovered. Essentially, the conditions under which we would tighten policy are driven by the inflation outlook.  That’s an important signal to governments. The interest rate policy is crystal clear and if the conditions in respect of inflation warrant a tightening of policy, that’s what the ECB is going to do. Those are conditions where the European economy is doing well, where the slack has disappeared, where there’s a high degree of confidence. Under those conditions the fiscal conditions will look very different in terms of the ability to revise fiscal policies.  What do you think will happen to the ECB’s bond holdings? Could these bonds be held for decades?  We’ve set out the conditions under which these portfolios will be rolled off. It’s not the case that there’s a commitment to perpetually hold onto them. We’ve said that when the inflation outlook allows it, they will be rolled off.  With the asset purchase programme, we’ve said that we’ll have net purchases until shortly before the period when we might tighten policy and the end of reinvestment will be dated after that. The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) is an exceptional measure, so how long we hold onto those assets could be different. We’ve said we’ll maintain the portfolio until the end of 2022, and that we will not let the roll-off of that portfolio interfere with our monetary policy. So that is saying that you do have to be careful about how you roll the portfolio off over time. But it’s also clear that the PEPP is a temporary measure. If the monetary conditions allow it, these portfolios will be rolled off. This is fundamental to protecting our independence.  How could this crisis affect labour productivity in the eurozone? Is there a risk that the ECB’s policies will help to keep afloat unviable “zombie” companies?  Increased digitalisation accelerates new ways of working, and that effect is non-trivial. At the ECB, we’ve found our ability to do business with less travel cost is there. So I think that productivity gain is real. There has been a critique that the European economy has been doing too little by way of public investment. Now, through this very innovative scheme – the EU recovery fund – that will, we think, have a significant impact on productivity, especially for those countries that are the biggest net recipients. It's also very important to remember the counterfactual. Easy monetary and fiscal policies are important to protect productivity. The worst impact on productivity would materialise if we allowed unnecessary recessionary forces, if we allowed that through a lack of monetary and fiscal support, a lack of demand. Then a lot of firms would go under that shouldn't have to. It is also worth keeping in mind that, over the last five to six years, the ECB and European supervisors have made a lot of progress on resolving non-performing loans, which have historically been the biggest concern in terms of zombie companies. When you think about low interest rates, we think the number of firms that would not survive if the interest rate were higher is quantitatively visible but small. So when you quantify it we don’t think that low interest rates as such are a big source of zombie dynamics. And even if it’s true that some firms are kept alive by low interest rates, the costs of raising interest rates so that such firms would be shut down, the cost of doing that would far exceed any benefit in terms of cutting off those firms.  There seems to be a lot more job creation in the United States than in Europe during this recovery – is that a concern?  One basic difference in how the US and European economies operate is reallocation within the firm versus reallocation across firms. In the United States, new entrants bring new technologies and then the existing firms shut down. That’s one way to operate the economy. A different way is adjustment within the firm. To switch for example from on the street to online retail, is that taking place by existing employees switching jobs?  Do you see a case for a bigger role for the state in the European economy?  At the very early stage of the discovery process for certain industries, I think there’s a strong case for more public research and development. The logic of the public sector making big bets on the private sector is not untroubled, historically. But you can see the case for having a degree of resilience in supply chains, for example in response to changing energy prices. But that doesn’t mean that the supply chain needs to be national in nature. The EU is an example where the states, rather than having national solutions, work together.   "
2020-10-10,Isabel Schnabel,The ECB’s independence in times of mounting public debt ,"Contribution by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung","   INTERVIEW  The ECB’s independence in times of mounting public debt    Contribution by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 10 October 2020 The pandemic is driving up government debt throughout the world. In the euro area, it is set to exceed 100% of GDP, a level that is, however, still below that of many advanced economies. In Germany especially, many observers are concerned about this development. They consider it a threat to the independence of the European Central Bank (ECB), fearing that “fiscal dominance” may induce it to deviate from its monetary policy objectives, endangering price stability. The purchases of sovereign bonds, which began in 2015 and were stepped up amid the pandemic, are sometimes even described as monetary financing, which is prohibited under the European Treaties. These criticisms don’t stand up to the facts. Neither is the ECB pursuing a policy of “financial repression” – it is not keeping interest rates low to make it easier for governments to finance their debt – nor have its asset purchases disabled the price discovery mechanism in financial markets. The ECB gears its monetary policy to its price stability mandate, not to the indebtedness of Member States.  The euro has been built on the principle of “monetary dominance”: the ECB’s objectives are solely determined by its mandate as defined in the European Treaties. This principle is buttressed by far-reaching political independence, the prohibition of monetary financing of public debt and a comprehensive fiscal framework. Is the rising public debt jeopardising this independence? Empirical research refutes this idea. There is no evidence of a systematic feedback loop from sovereign debt developments to monetary policy decisions. The public debt ratio in the euro area is notably lower than it would have been in the absence of the bond purchases. However, this primarily reflects the positive effects of monetary policy measures on economic growth, whereas the impact through lower interest rate expenses has been comparatively small. Without the measures taken since March, growth up to the end of 2022 would be around 1.3 percentage points lower. By contrast, history shows that financial repression would dampen economic growth. Moreover, a monetary financing of public debt would be expected to raise inflation expectations – as was the case in the 1970s. The ECB is faced with the opposite scenario: expectations remain well below our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%.  Also, in financial markets, yields in the euro area continue to noticeably react to risk factors. The risk premium on Italian sovereign bonds is higher today than when purchases started in 2015, and risk premia soared significantly during the political turbulence in 2018. The market’s price discovery mechanism continues to function primarily because most of the government bonds remain in the hands of investors other than the Eurosystem. And this has not changed during the pandemic. Nevertheless, financial markets can be gripped by panic, as was the case, for instance, when the pandemic first spread. Self-fulfilling price spirals then endanger the stability of financial markets. In such situations, central banks must act quickly to restore trust. Through generous liquidity provision, the market can find its way back to a “good” equilibrium and can again function smoothly. But would it not make sense to take on less public debt today to protect the ECB’s independence in the longer term? In fact, the opposite is true, as the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy has changed in the low interest rate environment. Many central banks have seen their room for manoeuvre curtailed over the past few years. As policy rates are already very low, monetary policy must increasingly turn to “unconventional” measures, such as asset purchases, to fulfil its mandate. This is primarily caused by structural changes to the economy, an ageing society, global excess savings and low productivity growth. These factors have led to a marked decline in the euro area’s real equilibrium interest rate – the rate that balances investment and savings. In this environment, fiscal policy gains importance. The decisive fiscal policy intervention in the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis strengthens the effectiveness of monetary policy and mitigates the long-term costs of the pandemic. With targeted, forward-looking investment, not least under the umbrella of the EU Recovery Fund, governments can foster sustainable growth, increase long-term competitiveness and facilitate the necessary reduction of the debt ratio once the crisis has been overcome. This would also afford the ECB more room for manoeuvre in the future, which would even strengthen its independence.

2020-10-07,Christine Lagarde,Written interview with Harvard International Review,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB","   INTERVIEW  Written interview with Harvard International Review   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB 7 October 2020  In normal times, the goal of any central bank is to keep the boat steady; suffice it to say, these are not normal times. How is the role of the ECB changing?  Keeping the boat steady is even more important in turbulent waters. While this may require some extraordinary manoeuvres, one should not lose sight of the course to reach the destination. This has been very much our role. Faced with the severe economic consequences of the pandemic, we have taken a number of extraordinary measures to support the economy and to help euro area citizens through this extremely challenging time. Failing to do so would have blown us off course in the delivery of our mandate to maintain price stability. The key pillars of our crisis response have been asset purchases and targeted liquidity operations. Under our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), we are purchasing assets with a total envelope of €1,350 billion, at least until the end of June 2021, to support favourable funding conditions for all sectors in the economy. Moreover, we have substantially eased the conditions under which banks can obtain liquidity under our targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Given the bank-centered financial system in the euro area, these operations are of great importance to ensure the flow of credit to especially smaller and medium-sized firms and to households. As a result of our measures, we have been able to avert the most adverse real-financial feedback loops, and financing conditions for governments, firms and banks have again improved. But inflation is still very distant from levels in line with our inflation aim. So we need to maintain an ample monetary policy stimulus to reach our objective.  You’ve called for a “safety net” until at least July 2021. While that may be the only option for the ECB, what long-term economic consequences do you expect as a result?  The pandemic has driven the euro area economy into an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented in peacetime. Confronted with such an unparalleled shock otherwise sound companies saw their liquidity buffers dwindle which risked turning into unnecessary bankruptcies and job losses. In response, macroeconomic policies in the euro area have acted forcefully, geared towards protecting productive capacity and jobs. National fiscal authorities have offered massive loan guarantees and other liquidity support measures to mobilize banks and deliver liquidity to firms as fast as possible. Monetary policy has flanked these measures by providing cheap central bank liquidity to the banking sector with the aim of supporting the maintenance of credit provision by the banking sector. In parallel, our asset purchases have supported financing conditions throughout the economy and have helped to stabilize financial markets. This package of measures has contributed to avoiding an even deeper recession and a credit crunch that would have left deep and long lasting scars on our economy.  However, we should guard against the premature withdrawal of these support measures. For this reason, we have already announced that we will maintain our “safety net” in place until we consider the COVID-19 crisis phase is over, but in any case not before the end of June 2021. This is not to mention other policies including fiscal measures and structural reforms.  The ECB has consistently struggled to implement monetary policy that satisfies all 19 member states. Especially in the midst of the pandemic, how do you hope to balance the problems facing different countries?  Indeed, while the pandemic is a common global shock, the local impact is going to be uneven. To illustrate this point: the output loss in the first half of 2020 ranges from less than 11.5% in Germany to more than 22.7% in Spain. These differences reflect both the severity of the outbreak, the design of the national response – itself a function of diverse fiscal positions –, the economic structure, the sectoral activity, the fiscal absorption capacity and the resilience of the corporate and financial sectors. These factors will also play a crucial role in shaping the profile of the recovery going forward. It is clear that the crisis might leave behind a legacy of even more pronounced divergences among the economies of the euro area than we have observed so far. Countries will return to pre-COVID GDP levels at different points in time, some earlier, some later. Those countries set to struggle for longer with the aftermath of the pandemic shock will likely suffer from deeper and longer-lasting scars. All this risks prolonging and even entrenching structural heterogeneity within the euro area.  This is why Europe’s Next Generation EU – COVID-19 recovery package (NGEU) is so critical. It has a dual function: not only can it help support demand, and this hastens the time for all economies to recover. But, at the same time, it can also increase the structural resilience and growth potential of the entire area, thus healing the wounds that the pandemic will likely leave behind.  Thus far, Europe has weathered COVID-19 without widespread unemployment. But some analysts worry that stimulus plans have quietly propped up moribund industries that will struggle in the long term. Are you worried about that possibility, and do you plan to address it?  There has been a timely and comprehensive response to the pandemic both at national and jointly at European level. This is true for monetary policy, with which we are supporting banks, firms and households through easier access to finance and by safeguarding medium-term price stability. But this is also true for national fiscal policies, which comprise a wide range of measures such as credit guarantee schemes for firms or employment support for workers. On the latter, given that you mention unemployment, the national measures have undoubtedly so far been very effective to support employment. ECB internal staff analysis estimates that about 13.5 million people are currently on job retention schemes in the euro area (8% of the labour force). This compares to about 12.8 million unemployed workers in July (7.9% of the labour force). Such schemes have successfully prevented a large-scale increase in unemployment. That said, the adjustment in the labour market is not yet completed. In fact, while we assume that the job retention policies will be largely successful in keeping ’reduced-time’ workers in employment, we expect a significant increase in the unemployment rate over the next quarters, in particular in the sectors most affected by the crisis. According to the September ECB Staff Macroeconomic Projections, unemployment is expected to rise from 7.3% in the first quarter of 2020 to 9.5% in 2021 before declining to 8.8% in 2022. An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains absolutely critical going forward, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy and remaining large uncertainties around the economic outlook. The Next Generation EU package is also very welcome and has the potential to significantly support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, strengthen the Single Market and build a lasting and even recovery. Additionally, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Commission via its Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) scheme, and the European Investment Bank made available a €540 billion safety net to help finance sovereign expenditures related to the pandemic, fund national short-time work schemes and provide credit guarantees to firms. At the same time, the national support measures should be temporary and targeted to ensure that only structurally sound firms are supported. This allows the structure of our economies to adjust where needed, so that capital and labour flow to the most productive companies in the economy. This is particularly important now, with the digital and green transformations of our economies underway. It is up to national governments to set the right incentives for productivity-enhancing investment and innovation that help rejuvenating the European economy. The European level will support governments in this endeavour, though, among other things through the initiatives just mentioned.  How has the ECB worked with national politicians and public health officials? What has the pandemic revealed about leadership and coordination across borders?  The European crisis response has powerfully demonstrated how closely policies interact and how communication between policy-makers at all levels is indispensable. The personal interactions between leaders of the Council, the Commission and European Central Bank as well as with member states’ leaders in the most acute phase of the crisis was decisive. From the perspective of a central bank, it also serves as a reminder that coordination does not mean that we sacrifice our independence; rather, the sound management of crisis situations and enabling the economy to get back on track as quickly as possible help to reinforce and guarantee our independence in the long term.  Via our participation in EU fora, the ECB has intensively interacted with national and EU-level policy-makers since the crisis outbreak. This has fostered a better understanding of the economic situation and impact of possible policy actions. In addition to its regular exchanges with the European Parliament, the ECB took part in discussions with Member States at the European level, particularly the European Council, ECOFIN and the Eurogroup, where the ECB contributed to shaping the European policy response with its input and advice.  Also thanks to these interactions, monetary and fiscal policies in the euro area have indeed reinforced each other. Owing to the EU institutional framework, where monetary policy is a European competence and fiscal stabilisation takes place through national budgets, national governments and the ECB were the first responders to the crisis in Europe. Besides adopting ambitious fiscal measures of around 4.5% of GDP, euro area governments have put in place loan guarantee schemes for companies equivalent to 20% of GDP. Monetary policy has provided €1.5 trillion to fund this credit expansion at the most favourable terms we have ever offered through our new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations. In order to ensure that lending reaches even the smallest borrowers, the ECB has also started to accept loans to micro firms and sole traders as collateral in our operations.  From March to May, the increase in bank lending to euro area firms was almost €250 billion, the largest rise on record in a three-month period. Across countries, loan growth and guarantee take-up are very strongly correlated.  Actions by the ECB and national governments have further been complemented and supported by decisive action at the European level. To help cushion the immediate impact of the crisis, the European Union temporarily eased its State Aid rules to allow Member States to better support companies and also agreed that Member States should not be constrained by the EU fiscal rules in designing their immediate crisis response. Moreover, the three safety nets by the European Stability Mechanism, the European Investment Bank and the European Commission via the European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) will provide up to €540 billion in support of European countries, companies and workers. Finally, in July, European leaders agreed on a recovery fund worth €750 billion to provide further crucial macroeconomic policy support to EU economies while investing in Europe’s future by using funds for modernisation, notably advancing the green and digital transitions. Without intensive exchanges and strong leadership, this historic policy response would not have been possible. It took courage and commitment from 27 countries and all EU institutions to provide the necessary policy support and to provide it swiftly. And it will still require more of the same to ensure we live up to the agreement on the European recovery fund by leaders and use it as the force for modernisation and recovery that Europe needs to emerge from this crisis not just stronger, but also more united, than before.  Stepping back a bit, what do you see as the biggest long-term challenges to Europe’s economic stability?  The current crisis has convincingly shown that Europe can react forcefully if need be – individually through bold national measures and jointly through the agreement on the Next Generation EU.  This notwithstanding, Europe still faces a number of economic challenges, among others related to an ageing population, climate change, fragmented capital market or economic structures that are not yet conducive enough to facilitate innovation, adoption of new technology, or an efficient allocation of resources more generally.  Let me give you a few examples.  An ageing European population will limit potential growth and present a challenge for social security systems. In that respect pension reforms and retraining policies play a key role in enhancing labour supply.  Moreover, policy efforts to accelerate the green and digital transitions should be at the centre of the EU agenda and recovery effort, both at national and European levels. They are important prerequisites for strengthening the economic resilience of our economies.  In this regards, the Digital Single Market is an important EU policy strategy, and its implementation could be accelerated and expanded. More investment by the public sector in digital technologies may be useful, along with faster progress in e-government, while start-ups and investment in intangible capital could be stimulated by greater provision of venture capital (VC), including in conjunction with further advances in the capital markets union.  Regarding the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy, it is important that policy measures to accelerate economic recovery are not only consistent with but further the objectives of the EU Green Deal. We also need extra efforts form policymakers to complete the Banking Union to achieve a truly unified domestic market for all European banks. This would reduce fragmentation across the European Single Market, diminish the bank-sovereign link, and thereby contribute to safer and sounder banks. Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that economic resilience across euro area countries varies. In several countries, rigid economic structures and inefficient institutions prevent an adequate economic response in a crisis situation. Going forward, it is essential to boost productivity, either by firms innovating and adopting new technology, or by reallocating resources within and across sectors towards the most productive firms. The good news is that with the agreement on the Next Generation EU package there is a great opportunity to strengthen economic resilience and convergence of Member States. This opportunity should not be missed. Implementing comprehensive and credible national reform agendas to support employment and growth in a sustainable way would reduce the economic and social costs of the next crisis.  Conventional economic theory suggests that inflation and unemployment are inversely correlated. In recent years, though, that hasn’t been the case: inflation has fallen well short of central bank targets, and is less sensitive to employment levels. Has that development changed your approach to monetary policy?  It is true that while employment growth has been strong before the COVID-19 pandemic, underlying inflation remained below its historical average in the euro area. Yet, that does not mean that the Phillips curve relationship is broken or that the effect of monetary policy on the real economy does not transmit to inflation. Empirical studies show that the slope of the Phillips curve is rather small in the euro area, which means that unemployment has to fall more to put pressure on inflation. We will go deeper into the subject in our monetary policy strategy review we just re-started. We will take stock of the drivers of inflation, also relating to structural developments, and assess to what extent they warrant a different approach to monetary policy decision-making.  You were the first woman to serve as finance minister for a G8 country, and the first woman to lead the IMF and the ECB. Still, gender equality in the field of economics remains elusive. What more needs to be done?  We should challenge the view that economics is for boys only. This is about challenging perceptions on what we think an economist should be and how they should behave.  Leaders can serve as powerful examples and catalysts of change. Of course, all of us have a collective responsibility to foster and contribute to inclusive behaviours and a respectful working environment. This also includes speaking up clearly if we see discriminatory and disrespectful situations.  In addition, organisations can implement inclusive policies. Family-friendly career paths and flexible working arrangements are just two examples of how the adverse environment can be addressed. Mentoring and sponsorship can be powerful means to level the playing field for women. But not only women should be involved in this transformation. Everyone needs to embrace inclusive behaviour and gender equality.  The causes of the gender inequality are equally important. I invite every organisation to investigate their data. At the ECB, we have conducted research to understand what drives disparities between female and male economists. We found a ‘gender application gap’, which means that women are less likely to apply for a promotion. But we also discovered that when they do apply, they are more likely to succeed. This gives me hope that change is possible and indeed necessary to ensure talent is not left behind.  Globalisation, automation, and immigration generally support economic growth, but also contributed to the right-wing populist movements that swept across Europe in recent years. How can governments support displaced populations while also boosting productivity?  Globalisation, automation and immigration trends call on governments to provide credible policies to support confidence and to make the economic adjustment more equal and sustainable. Globalisation has certainly contributed to economic growth. Openness fosters productivity gains by allowing an efficient allocation of resources and the materialisation of comparative advantages while at the same time enabling technological diffusion. However, the impetus towards economic integration has faded and public worries related to globalisation, e.g. inequality and equitable integration, have arisen in recent years. Domestic welfare policies together with multilateral cooperation are key to address those concerns. Automation and digitalisation present a potential for higher productivity growth. Yet, reaping this potential depends to a large extent on the availability of complementary assets such as human or managerial capital. Key aspects will include avoiding the digital divide within members states and to make further progress notably in terms of education and training with a view to improving job quality. This requires both public investment and private initiatives so that the labour market can fully reap the benefits of new technologies.  The pandemic outbreak has led to a faster adoption of technologies, including working from home. This has spurred additional investment and training which are expected to increase the technological content of certain jobs. While this can reduce the gap in the degree of technological adoption across countries, it may still increase inequality as low-skilled workers are less likely to benefit from these technological innovations. At the same time, Europe needs to tackle pockets of skill shortages and mismatches and it would be essential to foster workers’ upskilling, to identify the type of skills that will be needed in the future and to promote life-long learning. Firms’ investment in information and communication technologies as well as in R&D are fundamental drivers to create new and highly productive jobs. Well-functioning markets should support the transfer of new technologies and their diffusion. Firms should adopt management systems and organisational processes that can secure the full benefit of the digital era.  Let’s end on a positive note—I think we could all use that right about now. What makes you hopeful about the future of the European experiment?  Measured against any realistic expectations, Europe’s response to the crisis has been impressive. The European Union – and a still young currency union at the age of 21 – are just emerging from the biggest crisis in recent history thanks to the concerted policy efforts of member states and our common institutions in this exceptional situation. And while the recovery is only starting and we cannot yet afford to rest, this does give me hope that we can deliver and do the work that lies ahead of us.  Europe has shown that it has learnt its lessons from the past. For the first time in its history, the European Union will take on common debt to overcome a crisis. This broadens the boundaries of what is possible should we be struck by such dramatic shocks again. Even though the recovery fund is temporary, the potential to activate such tools in future crises is already a powerful change to the structure of the Union.  First, the euro area is highly interconnected, with trade and supply chain linkages amplifying common shocks by around 20%. This means that no country can recover and thrive fully unless its European partners do, too. Second, policies need to complement each other. Different from 2011-13, policies are fully aligned in securing the fastest possible recovery, which also underpins medium-term price stability. Third, the decision to place the recovery fund within the EU budget sent a strong signal about solidarity and the EU’s ability to take collective decisions. This was confirmed by the very positive market reaction already to the European Commission proposal in May and the July European Council agreement. Of course, we have a critical phase ahead of us, because much of the impact of the recovery fund will depend on how the money is used. The recovery fund helps all Member States, and notably those which are more fiscally constrained, to provide adequate policy support to their economies. Yet, to have a real transformative impact, raise our economies’ growth potential and avoid further divergence, Member States will have to be committed to implementing truly ambitious reforms alongside these investments. This will require political courage and strong European governance to ensure that the money is put to productive uses.  Ultimately, Europe is a community built on interdependence and the deep realisation that on the whole working together will deliver superior solutions to retreating behind national borders. This is true for the response to COVID-19, but also for any other major policy challenges – be it climate change or digitalisation. Through the Single Market, the EU is uniquely positioned to deliver the most cost-effective solutions for green and digital innovation. Firms, workers and consumers are rapidly becoming more accustomed to using digital technologies during the pandemic, which will likely have permanent effects on labour markets and consumption patterns. The Single Market offers unique opportunities to European companies to take advantage of those trends in Europe by exploiting network effects and the scalability of their products in a market with 450 million consumers.  It is also through the European Union that we can strengthen our strategic resilience and autonomy in key economic sectors in a more volatile world. The crisis is expected to have implications for global supply chains – which are estimated to shrink by 35% – but also for payment systems, for our financial sector, for the international role of the euro. Now more than ever, having a strong banking union and capital markets union backed by modern retail payments systems will be essential. Most importantly of all, European citizens want Europe to succeed: in a recent EU survey, 68% of respondents replied that they would like to see more EU competences to deal with crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and 56% would like the EU to have greater financial means to overcome the economic impact of the pandemic. Citizens clearly want more Europe and this is what policy-makers should deliver.   "
2020-10-01,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Market News International,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 29 September 2020 ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Market News International   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 29 September 2020  1 October 2020  The September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections appear to have added weight to the ECB’s baseline scenario. How do you interpret the most recent growth and inflation data? Is there a danger that they could be viewed too positively, or too negatively?  First of all, it’s implicit in our projections that for the rest of this year the inflation rate is going to be hovering around zero to negative, partly because of the pandemic and the evolution of the crisis, and partly because of VAT rebates – not only in Germany, but also in other countries like Ireland. These are ephemeral effects, one-offs. For 2021, the base effect is going to play in favour of a rebound in inflation, because the VAT rebates will disappear and the price of oil is most likely not going to continue declining. So we expect to see a certain bounceback of the economy that will have a positive impact on inflation. And finally, in 2022, we are projecting that the inflation rate will be on average 1.2-1.3%. But the further ahead you look, the more difficult the projections are. So, we are discounting that for the rest of the year the inflation rate will be negative or very close to zero. And there are two forces that are at odds here. On the one hand, the pandemic. On the other hand, supply chains will become more regional, and this is something we need to look at carefully because it could offset the drop in demand. But we are monitoring inflation continuously, and as always we are totally open to recalibrating our measures in accordance with our inflation projections.   If we’re not out of the woods yet, when, if at all, might we expect discussion around an increase in the size or duration of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), or another change in monetary policy, to take place?   If you look at the pandemic, there is a worrying increase in the number of outbreaks across Europe. At the same time, most governments have rejected the idea of a lockdown like the one in March. It seems we are entering the second wave of infections, but perhaps governments have understood that a lockdown as pervasive as the one we had some months ago would be a total disaster for the economy. So governments are trying to combine the public health element of the pandemic with keeping economies open.  Regarding our baseline scenario, more than focusing on the average, people should be looking at the dispersion around the average. This is relevant and makes a very clear point in favour of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is the first line of defence. Some countries will clearly be below the average decline in GDP of 8%, but others will be well above. Fiscal policy has to focus on the latter group.  If that fiscal support, both nationally and at European level, is there, is it possible that we may see no further easing before the end of the year?  We need to look at the overall picture. I would not say that that’s necessarily going to be the situation. First of all, there is no evidence of financial tightening. This is something we have avoided. Then, we need to observe inflation developments. And we also need to keep an eye on how fiscal policy is implemented at the national and European levels. The PEPP is an emergency and temporary programme, tailor-made to deal with the pandemic. And we still have more than half of the total envelope available. We have not run out of ammunition at all. We extended the programme until at least mid-2021 and, if necessary, we could adjust and recalibrate it in the future. We have not taken that decision yet. And, in my opinion, it’s not necessary for us to take it immediately.   Is there currently a “sweeping review” of the future of the PEPP?  We are continuously assessing our monetary policy stance, and the PEPP is part of that. There’s not a specific moment in time to carry out a “sweeping review” of the programme. We do analyse our measures and economic developments at every Governing Council and Executive Board meeting, so I would not say we are going to select a specific moment in time to conduct a so-called sweeping review.  It would appear that there is some disagreement within the Governing Council over whether or when the PEPP should be expanded or extended. Would you say those favouring an expansion or extension of the PEPP currently make up a minority or a majority within the Governing Council?  We are implementing the programme. We have room for manoeuvre in terms of the envelope. We have time. We have flexibility. And everybody is quite happy with developments in the sovereign debt markets. There are 25 members of the Governing Council, and it’s normal for us to have different views. That being said, we have not discussed the extension of the PEPP. We increased the envelope by €600 billion on top of the existing €750 billion, and that was an almost unanimous decision. Nobody questioned whether or not we should increase the envelope. There were different views about the amount, but in the end the €600 billion figure got a lot of support.  Right now we are not having that discussion. It will come, but when exactly depends on the evolution of the pandemic, on the evolution of the economy, on the projections, on inflation, and on the situation in financial markets, as we are putting a lot of emphasis on avoiding a tightening of financial conditions.  It’s been suggested that we may never see a clear and definite end to the “crisis phase” of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. That would appear to have implications for the PEPP as a temporary emergency measure. If the PEPP is phased out, might some of the envelope allocated to it be transferred to the APP? Can the same be said of the flexibility afforded to the PEPP, in terms of capital key convergence and issuer limits?  We haven’t discussed that potential situation in the Governing Council. Let’s hope that the pandemic will start to fade away and that a vaccine will be available soon. I am sure that science will be able to deal with the pandemic. But then we need to see what the structural scars of the pandemic are, and how long it’s going to take to come back to the pre-COVID-19 level of output. And that takes me to the question of how to balance two different objectives: one being how to minimise the damage, and the other being how to avoid unnecessary fiscal, monetary or prudential stimuli. That is going to be the most telling moment. On the one hand you cannot withdraw stimuli too rapidly and, on the other hand, you have to be careful about the side effects of stimuli being too large. We need to convert the cliff edge into a ramp, and the ramp has to go in parallel with the trajectory of the economy.   The ECB does not target the exchange rate. However, it is carefully assessing exchange rate developments. If the euro strengthens rapidly, what can the ECB do to counter that movement?   There was an appreciation of the euro. We closely monitor the development of the exchange rate because it has an impact on the evolution of the economy and inflation. It’s not a policy target, but we do not overlook it, either. This is our approach. It was clearly expressed by the President in the last press conference.  Furthermore, if you look at the communiques of the G20, there is always a reference to the fact that economic policies in general, and not only monetary policies, should not target the exchange rate as this would lead to a currency war.   Yet there have been suggestions that some members of the Governing Council were unhappy with the lack of a more forceful expression of concern from the ECB with regard to the strength of the euro at the press conference following the last Governing Council meeting. One member said recently that “if the downward pressures jeopardise our price stability objective, we’ll have to intervene.” Does that not indicate the strength of feeling and a willingness to act that runs counter to what you’re saying?  I think it’s fully compatible. If any concrete situation or variable jeopardises our inflation objective, for sure we will react. That’s common sense, and it’s part of our reaction function. When we make our projections about inflation we take into consideration the exchange rate and its evolution. It is included in our models, and so indirectly it has an impact on inflation.   We’ve heard that it is the dynamics of the exchange rate rather than its level that is of principal concern. Have you given any thought to what dynamics would give you serious concern, and is there a level below which the ECB would prefer the euro to remain?  No, we do not have any concrete level at all. We take into consideration its evolution, and it is included in our models, but we do not have a red line. It’s much more a question of the trajectory of the variable.  Including if that level looks like becoming a permanent feature?  Again, I think this is not the case. We saw an appreciation. Afterwards the dollar appreciated a little bit against the euro. You have to bear in mind that if there is a market that has overreactions, it’s the foreign exchange market. Let’s give a little bit of perspective to the situation. For instance, a significant part of the appreciation of the euro occurred when the recovery fund was approved. The problem now is that growth is very low, and simultaneously there are some trade tensions. At the global level, the biggest mistake we could make would be to transform the trade disputes into a form of currency dispute. That would be suicidal and would repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression.  What are the implications for the ECB’s monetary policy strategy review of the Fed’s move to average inflation targeting? Is it something you would be in favour of? Is there a danger that a structurally dovish Fed leads to a permanently strong euro?  We always look at the Federal Reserve, as the central bank of one of the largest economies in the world, but our mandates are different. The Fed has a dual mandate, but we have only price stability as the primary mandate. So we look carefully, we communicate, but the situation here in the euro area is structurally different.  In our case the definition of price stability is relevant. But in my view the analysis of the instruments we have available to reach that target is even more relevant.  What are your personal ambitions for the outcome of the review? Is there anything you would particularly like to see or not see?  Observers are going to pay a lot of attention to the issue of the definition of price stability – whether and how it evolves. But in my view the key element of our discussion is going to be the instruments. How the instruments are pursued. How effective are they, what the potential side effects are. This is the most important part of the strategy review. But this is just a personal view.   Christine Lagarde recently described the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity to create the conditions for more inclusive, greener and more digital growth. Would you like to see the ECB be more assertive, or more expansive, in its interpretation of its secondary mandate responsibilities? Might that be one outcome of the strategy review?  The secondary objectives are going to be relevant. Central banks are not ensconced in an ivory tower. If you look at the EU’s priorities – and we have to support these priorities – there are two that are especially relevant: digitalisation, and environmental or climate change-related issues. We have started to consider how climate change would affect the solvency of banks and non-banks. We expect governments will start to apply fiscal policies and taxation policies to deal with climate change. These actions will have an impact on inflation and activity, and therefore we have to take them into consideration in our projections and reaction function. Furthermore, climate change is becoming a financial risk. So what we expect, and what we are trying to foster, is that whenever we receive an assessment for a bond or an asset, rating agencies take into consideration not only the durational solvency and financial risks, but also this new dimension that is climate change. It may be very relevant in the near future, because this is one of the main guidelines we use to decide on our purchases. Besides, the question of inclusion is important, and after the pandemic it is going to be much more so. But the main actors need to be governments through fiscal policy, taxation and expenditure, because all three can target the concrete segments of the population you want to address much more. Monetary policy, in terms of improving the economic situation, can have an indirect impact. If the economy grows, jobs will be created, and this will be a key element of any social policy. However, as a general guideline, fiscal policy should be the main tool used to achieve social inclusion.   "

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted on 24 September 2020","   INTERVIEW  Q&A on Twitter   Interview on Twitter with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted on 24 September 2020 24 September 2020 Good afternoon, this is Philip R. Lane, the @ecb’s Chief Economist. I’m looking forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Join the conversation! #AskECB   Where do you expect world economy is heading by the end of this year and what the prospectus of 2021. Specially England and Indian economy?  Lane: The global economy was badly hit in the first half of 2020 by the pandemic, no doubt. While there has been some recovery since then, our latest ECB staff projections show that global real GDP will only be back at pre-crisis levels by 2022 https://ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.projections202009_ecbstaff~0940bca288.en.pdf #AskECB   #AskECB How long will it take for Strategy Review to reach conclusion re: core tools of monetary policy for future? Is there a case to make announcement on toolbox before Review complete? How do you see outcome of Review impacted by NGEU Fund/possible future fiscal risk sharing?  Lane: We expect to conclude the strategy review in the second half of 2021. One of our strategy review workstreams focuses on the changing fiscal policy landscape and implications for monetary policy. All workstreams here https://ecb.europa.eu/home/search/review/html/workstreams.en.html #AskECB   #AskECB Following Michael Woodford's presentation at the ECB on Sept 4th, is the ECB researching the comparative benefits of direct fiscal transfers to households vs. interest-rate policy?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG9zPz2oeDI     Lane: Large-scale transfers to households have been central to the effective fiscal response to the pandemic. We monitor the impact of these transfers, taking into account the different spending propensities of low-income and high-income households  #AskECB   Do you think the ECB's actions reguarding negative interest rates do no harm? why is their an inflation target? Why is this anything but systematic theft from savers  Lane: The current negative rates are a pathway to positive rates in the future. Our rate cuts have been successful and have been passed on to bank lending rates, ensuring favourable conditions for firms and households. We constantly assess benefits and risks #AskECB   When CBDC?  Lane: Like many other central banks, we are exploring the benefits, risks and operational challenges of introducing a digital euro in addition to banknotes and other means of payment. We haven’t taken a decision but are launching a public consultation soon  #AskECB   What's your opinion about money like #Bitcoin that can not be debased compared to fiat like euro? #AskECB  Lane: There is no comparison between money issued by the central bank and crypto assets. More in our explainer https://ecb.europa.eu/explainers/tell-me/html/what-is-bitcoin.en.html   #AskECB   Secular stagnation should now be accepted as the baseline scenario for the future, also from a risk-management point of view. Do you agree? If not, why?  #AskECB    https://econjwatch.org/articles/lawrence-summers-deserves-a-nobel-prize-for-reviving-the-theory-of-secular-stagnation     Lane: Central banks have to recognise the implications of low growth and low interest rates. New approaches are needed to revitalise our economies, including a focus on the green and digital transitions.  #NextGenerationEU  is an important step in the right direction  #AskECB   #AskECB whatever it does the ECB seems to have little impact on inflation. If you HAD to change the main goal to something else what would be your first choice ?  Lane: Without our measures, output would be lower and we would face more severe disinflation or even deflation. Ample stimulus is still needed to get back to our inflation aim  #AskECB   #AskECB What do you think about the spread between rich and poor? especially with the flood of money the gap is increasing..stocks and real estates benefit from the cheap money and what we see in the real world are crazy costs for living. Renting a flat is nearly impossible...  Lane: We track many measures of inflation, including rental and food prices. We’re piloting a survey of 10,000 households in the euro area to better understand their inflation expectations   https://ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/consumer_exp_survey/html/index.en.html  #AskECB   #AskECB Is PEPP able to have success and meet its objectives as pandemic cases are rising and economic growth is going through slowdown in many nations  Lane: In recognition of the extreme uncertainty, the scale and flexibility of the PEPP was expressly designed to address the impact of the pandemic. Fiscal measures by the EU and national governments are also substantial  #AskECB   If the ECB can digitally print unlimited amounts of currency to fund governments, why do I pay taxes?  Lane: Monetary financing is prohibited by EU Treaty. More in my colleague @Isabel_Schnabel’s recent speech  https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200911~ea32bd8bb3.en.html   #AskECB   How has your assessment on the economic outlook evolved over the last few weeks given the sharp increase in new COVID cases and weak services activity ?  #AskECB  Lane: Containing the virus is the most important policy objective. Our baseline allows for some periodic resurgence of the virus until a full-scale medical solution is found  #AskECB   #AskECB why are you and other central banks inflating assets and real estate so badly that it has become virtually impossible for young people to afford a house? Why do you keep debasing your currency? #bitcoin  Lane: In general, consumer inflation has been too low, not too high. Asset price dynamics are heavily affected by the low equilibrium real rate. I spoke about this topic last year https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2019/html/ecb.sp191128_1~de8e7283e6.en.html   #AskECB   #AskECB A strong driver in low inflation prints in recent months were services. Service inflation in turn seems to suffer from social distancing. Is any reversal of this social distancing disinflation part of the staff projections?  Lane: The baseline scenario in our staff projections indeed factors in that a medical solution is found over the course of next year. This would support a recovery in the service sector and put upward pressure on service sector inflation  #AskECB   Hi. What are the countercyclic meassures that the ECB is taking in order to stabilize the situation?  #AskECB  Lane: We have PEPP, TLTROs, collateral easing and, on the supervisory side, a host of measures. See full overview here https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200827~1957819fff.en.html #AskECB   Does the Chief Economist think that the removal of 1c and 2c coins from circulation would have any material impact on price levels?  #AskECB  Lane: No #AskECB   How many sustainable-linked bonds have become eligible as a result of this decision? And why were those bonds not eligible already?  #AskECB  Lane: By accepting sustainability-linked bonds as collateral we expand the range of green bonds that can be bought as part of the asset purchase programmes. A small step that brings us closer towards a greener economy  #AskECB   #AskECB @ecb EA inflation is on a downward trend against a background of low demand and euro appreciation : what is your assessment of deflation risks in the upcoming months?  Lane: Rather than deflation risk, our primary concern is inflation remaining below our aim for an excessive period #AskECB   ""A strong majority (62%) of Americans say they have little or no trust in the central bank"" Have you observed similar trend outside America?  #AskECB  Lane: We agree that trust in the central bank is essential. For a recent analysis see https://ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2020/html/ecb.ebart202004_01~9e43ff2fb2.en.html #AskECB   With COVID cases increasing in diferent countries like Spain o Germany, What does the ECB think about the new restrictions and how they are going to afect de economy in the Euro Zone?  #AskECB  Lane: The first priority is to contain the virus – if there is a sustained surge in cases, this will damage consumer and investor confidence #AskECB   #AskECB The m3/GDP ratio has gone up from mid 70% at the behinning of this century to currently way over 100% What would be an about right ratio or range?  Lane: The monetary aggregates are highly informative but cannot be reduced to simple ratios #AskECB   #AskECB thank you M.Lane agreed it would have been worst but we are still far away from the mark (any central bank).Maybe we are pursuing something which is not the proper indicator to get to other goals of the Treaty ie employment and substainable development for instance ;)  Lane: Part of the strategy review will be to look at how the secondary objectives affect our policy. Here are all workstreams https://ecb.europa.eu/home/search/review/html/workstreams.en.html   #AskECB   Have you considered expanding the eligible universe of assets for purchase to benefit the real economy (Green bonds, SME loans), rather than only sovereign bonds and large, investment-grade corporates? #AskECB  Lane: We hold about 20% of the eligible corporate green bonds. As a further step, we decided to accept bonds with sustainability-liked coupon targets as collateral, which increases the eligible universe for our asset purchase programmes https://ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200922~482e4a5a90.en.html   #AskECB   #AskECB Who will be the owner of the digital euro? Who will create it?  Lane: The euro belongs to the citizens of Europe, be it banknotes or digital. The ECB is the custodian on their behalf  #AskECB  Thanks a lot for all your questions – I had a great time during my second Twitter Q&A and look forward to next time. Philip R. Lane #AskECB    "
2020-09-23,Yves Mersch,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon and Carolynn Look","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon and Carolynn Look 23 September 2020  The latest ECB forecasts weren’t much changed, some of the data is good, some of it not so good. What’s your view of the outlook at the moment?  I must say that since the last time we took action, the least one could say is that things in the economy have not gone for the worse. And even with sometimes conflicting incoming information, most of it has led us to say that the risk balance may still be somewhat to the downside but less so than it has been, and that led us to no change because we said we are broadly in line with our baseline. Looking also at new incoming information I think nothing is pointing to a further deterioration at least not on the front of prices and production. I do not speak on the health system, and that is why I have to bring in a caveat. This is based on an assumption that things continue as they are right now, that there is no major deterioration on the health front. Now a deterioration on the health front might not be only an increase of people being contaminated, it would be an increase in pressure on the health systems. New generalised lockdown measures which so far we have seen have by and large been resisted or applied in a more ‘surgical’ fashion. Since we do not exactly know in what direction the health situation will develop it is very difficult to draw very concrete conclusions on the development of our scenarios. At the beginning of the crisis or even until summer we had the feeling that between our baseline and the two extreme scenarios many thought we might came out somewhere in between. Now it looks as if we would be closer to the baseline scenario, maybe with chances to come out a bit closer to the upward scenario if the health situation is not deteriorating.  The second element of uncertainty is the feedback from the banking sector, let’s call it the financial amplification. Measures have been taken and this is not only measures from the monetary policy side: collateral, ample liquidity, the TLTROs, tiering PEPP. It is also the supervisory actions, the regulatory adjustment. And it is also the general ambience that Europe this time was able to not only have national reactions - which would have increased even more the already worrisome fragmentation that we see emerging in Europe again - but we also had a response at the European level. This was very supportive in trying to buffer the economic outfall. And you have seen that the trough, which is behind us, has been a little bit less steep than forecast, and the rebound is now being revised slightly upwards. So uncertainty remains. It is no reason to be only intelligent if you are more pessimistic than the one who spoke before you. There is no reason to be complacent. We have our programs, they have been extremely efficient, and we believe that they need to continue.  A lot of the actions you’ve taken this year are linked to this crisis phase. What are you using to assess where we are in the crisis, and at different stages of both the health and the economic crisis do different tools become more relevant?  It is obvious that the response that we will see on the health front - and that means not only finding a vaccine, but producing it and distributing it, and access to it - those are different questions to be answered and that will affect the sequence of the solution. So those are areas which are outside our span of control obviously but they will affect the strength of the rebound. And then there are areas of uncertainty which are closer to our area, and that is to what extent has such a shock induced structural shifts. And in order to give a good answer you have to distinguish first to what extent has this shock been working through the supply-side and the demand side. This is a very difficult question and we have seen different studies in this respect. By and large if I can cut the long story short, for the moment it looks as if the downfall in prices might be attributed roughly 50% to the demand side and 50% to the supply side. But - and this makes it a little bit more tricky - we see that the dynamics evolve as the situation develops. What has been downside for demand could suddenly become upside for demand, and for supply it is the same. What are the global value chains that will be most disrupted and to what extent will that create an upward price pressure, as restraint on supply meets piled-up demand. You might also have behavioural changes on the demand side. It’s very difficult to speculate on how people will react permanently, because some short-term reaction might not be persistent and then if you did factor in a structural change, you might be on the wrong side. For example, will there in the future be permanently less people in some sectors - leisure, tourism, those sectors that are most impacted - or will people revert to the normal consumption patterns once things clear up and a vaccine is distributed? It’s difficult to say. The distancing measures, will they be reinforced, will we stay with the present ones? The lockdown, will it be as strict as in the past? That’s why we have beyond our baseline the positive scenario and less positive scenario and we have to continue to monitor closely incoming information. We better err on the side of prudence. That means we have to provide ample liquidity to support the recovery amidst longer uncertainty. Now, on the instruments, of course, in some situations one instrument is more efficient and the Governing Council has signalled that asset purchases and TLTROs have presently more traction than our traditional instruments.  The economists that we’ve spoken to and markets in general are expecting more bond purchases at the December meeting. What are you thinking about what markets are saying and whether that matches up with what’s likely?  Of course the markets like if we buy up everything that they have. We will take our decisions on the basis of the whole euro area and on the basis of the shutdown in individual countries. And we will take decisions on the basis of the information that we have accumulated since our last decision-making. We are open-minded, but the open mindedness goes both ways. We always insist on symmetry. If the situation should hugely improve, our reaction should be the opposite of a reaction to a deterioration and also different from a continuation along the baseline. We have encouraged the banks to continue financing the economy. We have given them very favourable conditions through different instruments - the tiering, the TLTRO, the PELTRO - and the banks have done their job. We have also seen public guarantees that have been extremely helpful in maintaining asset quality, and we have seen the moratoria. But one day they will run off. Our concern is to avoid cliff effects. The cliff effects can be coming from both sides. Either the banks do not prepare sufficiently in advance - preparing in advance means recognizing impairments, increasing the provisioning, and we have given them capital space in order to do that. And: this capital space is not meant to be distributed to shareholders, it is meant for the economy. But as supervisors we certainly also need to insist that banks do proper risk management and acknowledge the recognition of impairment and do the appropriate provisioning. The banks’ capital situation has improved in the second quarter as much as it had deteriorated in the first quarter. The impairment has also doubled. But we could imagine further impairments as support measures unfold, structural change sets in, the pace of recovery is uncertain. If you compare with the situation under the great financial crisis I think we have reacted faster and more forcefully with all public-sector firepower in this crisis. But we have to continue to transform the cliffs into ramps. That needs the contribution not only of monetary policy, but also of other policy areas, especially fiscal policy.  What’s the importance of interest rates in this environment, and what some economists have described as the dual rate? Could there be a situation that as the crisis progresses and we see that lockdown restrictions don’t materialize in the very harsh way that we’ve seen before, where perhaps stimulus in the form of more PEPP isn’t the most appropriate tool?  We have never said that the interest rate is no more at our disposal. We have communicated in the past that we believe that the other instruments might have equivalent or superior effects in present circumstances. The next time we take a decision we again will do a holistic assessment of all our toolbox instruments and we will choose the one that we consider most appropriate in view of the situation. As to your underlying question, if we were to have a dual rate system we would have to look very carefully not to lose control and to keep traction with the instruments that would be most appropriate to transmit our monetary policy decisions.  It has been argued that a rate cut would be one of the best ways to tackle an appreciation of the euro. Is that an argument that makes sense to you?  I have to start by telling you…  … that you don’t target the exchange rate.  So that’s my first point. The second is that as Europeans we are very attached to multilateralism, and on exchange rates we have consensus language at the global level that has been valid for many years now, and that does not only speak about the exchange rates being in line with fundamentals but it also speaks about the volatility, excess volatility being disruptive.  This being said, it is obvious that the recent movement in the exchange rate has had statistical effects on some of our measures of inflation and production. And since we are very committed to price stability, we will certainly monitor the developments. So, we will monitor very closely the effects of exchange rate developments on our efforts to attain our objective of price stability, but this is by no way a change in strategy.  You were previously, but more so now, targeting a price stability goal which is somewhat different to the Fed’s goal.  We have had the numerical definition of price stability from our inception, we have been well served by our strategy and our definition of price stability, and I would add that we have been well served by having a definition that is medium term oriented. This medium term orientation gives us the necessary flexibility which is especially important in times of high uncertainty, and which allows also a time varying response function which takes into account the different effects of a shock. I’ve never been convinced to change a winning team.  It’s not entirely a winning team in terms of inflation though. It’s not entirely the ECB’s fault but inflation has been well below the goal for a very long time.  If you look over 22 years we do not need to hide. But if you have shocks for example as we see now - VAT reduction - or through commodities on which we have no influence - then we see through it. So it’s not by changing the goalposts that we will score more goals convincingly.  There was a report out recently suggesting that a sweeping review is being undertaken, and one argument in that is that the relatively high flexibility of PEPP could be copied over to the asset-purchase program. Is that true, and does it make sense?  I saw the article, but as a member of the Executive Board I am not aware of such a development. I can tell you that we look of course permanently at all developments. The PEPP has been created first and foremost to be a backstop to ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy decisions, and to be a backstop to provide liquidity. And it has been extremely efficient. In view of its sheer size it also has a second function, and that is to reinforce our monetary policy stance. But it is an emergency instrument created because of the pandemic. Take a democracy: It’s always easier to govern if you have emergency powers and you prolong the emergency powers forever. The PEPP is an emergency instrument. We have stated that we have disenfranchised ourselves from a certain number of self-imposed constraints in view of the pandemic and in view of its exceptional nature and threat - and that means it must be temporary. Now of course you can extend the temporary character, but the pandemic will not last forever. But unconstrained flexibility also increases the risk of arbitrariness. And in order to limit the arbitrariness of institutions, we have the scrutiny of jurisdictions. And we have publicly in the courts promised to jurisdictions what we were doing in order to protect the red lines that have been put into the Treaty, especially the monetary financing prohibition. So if you now say we have emergency instruments which do not need to respect these constraints, and we use them now also in our normal procedures, I do not know what the same jurisdictions would say in their future assessment.   So does that imply that the APP is not temporary?  It is subject to constraints vetted by the ECJ, and it is temporary as we have already once suspended it. The PEPP is exceptional and therefore temporary. We have always said it is linked to the assessment of the Governing Council on how long this pandemic is affecting us. So we cannot say the pandemic is over but we continue with the PEPP, or we transfer the PEPP features into the APP. To my humble understanding of what the law means this would be very curious.  President Lagarde said recently that a Eurosystem taskforce on the digital euro is due to present its findings in the coming weeks. How has this review affected your position on the matter?  We have a treaty obligation to promote safe and efficient payment systems, because they are supporting our monetary transmission mechanism. Therefore we must follow technological evolution very closely in order to be permanently able to serve our citizens. It's also extremely important that a central bank keeps a direct link to its citizens. That means with the emergence of non-European public and private initiatives as of late, there is also a discussion concerning European sovereignty and maintenance of the role of the currency. Cash is still in strong demand. Maybe in terms of payment it has receded a bit during the crisis, but the demand is still there. So we are ready to bring to our citizens what they ask. We want to give them a choice and we will give them a choice. That's the explanation why we also develop studies into a central bank digital currency. That doesn't mean we are rolling it out or implementing it, we are just conducting a thorough study as is being done in other jurisdictions.  Could we soon see experiments being run in the eurozone similar to what the PBOC is doing in China?  The PBOC has its own governance and its own strategy, we follow ours. There is a long list of questions that are not yet solved, and we will come closer to a solutions by doing small, real-time experiments.  There was a report by Buzzfeed talking about banks who are filing suspicious activity reports, and yet still moving money around. It suggests the banking system is still falling short in some areas. What's your view on that?  If they fall short they should stand up and be responsible for it. Some banks have been subject to close supervisory reviews and queries in the past, and as far as we know from all of the banks action has been taken. These are reports looking 10 or 12 years back. The banks have adjusted their governance and procedures. We are not in charge directly. We are awaiting new legislation from the Commission on anti-money laundering - all this is strengthening the European framework.  Your career goes back to the birth of the euro. For roughly half of that time the ECB struggled to hit its inflation goal. Not all of that is the ECB's fault, but you'll leave before the strategy review is completed. What is your lasting advice to the ECB and to your successor?  If the world changes and you do not change, then you are falling behind the curve and not fulfilling your role. You regularly have to do a re-assessment of yourself, your instruments, and your strategy. In the future it might make sense not to wait 18 years but rather to do it more often, especially if we face a higher number of shocks that we have no experience with, which might have structural change as a consequence. Secondly, you also do not change as a kind of fashion. It should reflect structural changes. Because otherwise you blur the perception in the public of what you stand for. We must be able to explain the strategy review to the public at large. Any change must be soundly warranted and explained. The measurement of inflation is one of the first work streams that has been internally discussed. On owner-occupied housing, we have made a lot of progress on how to collect information, how to distinguish what is the housing element from the investment element. Another question is whether we collect only prices of goods and services, or should look into experiences with a cost of living index rather than a CPI. There are a lot of discussions on this topic.That's my only regret -- I love this discussion, that is my life and I have to leave it.  The brand new element to this discussion is climate change, which President Lagarde is pushing pretty hard for. Are you comfortable with that?  It's a societal change that we will have to factor in. The difficult part is the circumscription, definition, there's a lot of greenwashing going around as well. But what is important is that it reaches the real economy, where it will have transformational capacities that will affect a lot of people. It's a question of transition and a transition needs to be financed. It's not all in the hands of central banks, we are at the end of it. If we are pushing awareness that's already a big contribution. If in the end central bankers are perceived as politicians, that would not be helpful in my opinion.   "
2020-09-20,Luis de Guindos,Interview with La Razón,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Jesús Rivasés on 14 September 2020 ","   INTERVIEW  Interview with La Razón   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Jesús Rivasés on 14 September 2020  20 September 2020  Are we already living in a new economic world?  At the moment we are suffering the effects of a pandemic. The world was not ready for the type of lockdown that occurred in the vast majority of economies, and the fallout has been severe: the GDP contraction has been unprecedented and the way we do many things has changed. The hope is that, as the pandemic subsides, we return to some sort of normality. There are structural factors that may change, such as our global value chains. From now on, more importance on proximity, not just profitability and cost efficiency, may be placed. The pandemic will also result in more debt, both public and private. These are issues which, once a solution to the pandemic has been found, will still exist and will affect day-to-day economic decisions.  Should the European Union continue to offer stimulus and/or prolong the suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact?  When there is such a sharp decline in GDP and private sector income, as there has been during the pandemic, the public sector has to intervene temporarily to halt the slump. This was unavoidable, and both the fiscal and monetary stimulus should continue for as long as we feel the effects of the pandemic.  Is the ECB prepared to maintain its low interest rate policy and asset purchase programmes for as long as required?  The ECB’s response to the pandemic was, first and foremost, to provide banks with liquidity on very favourable terms to enable them to continue lending to businesses and households. We then expanded our asset purchase programme through the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) to stabilise financial markets. This avoided fragmentation in the sovereign debt markets. Last of all, some banking supervision rules were adapted to ensure that credit could continue to flow.  Nevertheless, the first line of defence is fiscal policy, both national and pan-European, with the latter embodied by the recovery fund approved by the European Council. The response, from both a fiscal and a monetary perspective, has been completely different from the previous crisis. This time around it has been fast and powerful, enabling us to avoid an even bigger contraction in euro area GDP than the one recorded in the first half of the year. It will also help contribute to the economic recovery.   Is there any possibility that the PEPP, which for the time being is temporary, will be made permanent?  It is a temporary emergency programme which is serving its purpose.  But temporary things sometimes have a habit of becoming permanent…  For now, the PEPP will run until the middle of next year. It has a total envelope of €1.35 trillion, a substantial amount of which has still not been used. The programme is very flexible; it is serving its purpose and there is still room for manoeuvre. It averted a sharp increase in spreads and enabled financial markets to remain calm. Thanks to that, we have avoided having to deal with a debt crisis on top of the public health and economic crisis, and this has been crucial. Looking ahead, the ECB stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate. For the moment, we believe that the programme is performing well, also from the point of view of pursuing our primary objective – our inflation aim.  To what extent could the ECB expand its balance sheet?  I would phrase it differently: the ECB has to act for as long as its price stability objective is not met.  Will the ECB keep inflation as its primary objective?  It is the EU Treaty that says that the ECB’s primary objective is price stability. What has changed over time is the definition of price stability. To begin with, it was below 2%, and in 2003 it was clarified that would mean “below, but close to, 2%”. Here at the ECB we are now engaged in a strategy review that will evaluate, among other things, whether the current definition of price stability is fit for purpose.  Would you advocate for the ECB to follow the example of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and consider employment as well as inflation?  The ECB’s mandate is price stability. The Fed has a dual mandate – price stability and employment. That being said, when the ECB calculates its inflation projections, it also takes into account economic variables such as economic growth and employment. But our primary mandate, which we do not set for ourselves but is set out for us in the Treaty, is defined in terms of price stability.  Are you worried that the Fed’s new policy will leave the door open to higher inflation, and that that door will be impossible to close?  Our inflation projections indicate that the risk is inflation being very low, not very high. After the pandemic, in theory there is the possibility of value chains being less efficient and less global, and that this will cause inflation to increase. But we also take this into account when we make our projections, and even then inflation is projected to reach 1.3% in 2022, which is clearly below the ECB’s definition of price stability.  Do you see a euro/dollar currency war on the horizon?  There are certainly tensions around trade and low economic growth but, from the point of view of international economic governance, it would be suicidal to enter into any sort of dispute about exchange rates.  Should the ECB intervene to prevent the appreciation of the euro?  Setting the exchange rate is not an ECB objective. Our objective is price stability. However, when I said earlier that we monitor a very broad range of economic variables, that includes the exchange rate, because it affects medium-term inflation expectations. We keep it in mind, but we do not target the exchange rate because that is not our mandate.  But will the ECB monitor developments in the exchange rate, just in case?  We will monitor it, we will analyse it, it will be an input for the models we use to calculate our inflation projections, but our ultimate objective in doing so is not to influence the exchange rate. Rather, we do it because of the impact the exchange rate has on inflation.  In the case of the euro and the dollar, to use Mario Draghi’s words, will the ECB do whatever it takes?  Those words were used in reference to a different issue, not the exchange rate. I’ll say it again: we do not target the exchange rate. It is an important variable, as the appreciation of the euro has an impact on our inflation projections, and these projections influence our monetary policy. Not because of the exchange rate itself, but because of its ramifications for inflation in the medium term.  Would some euro area countries have gone bankrupt without the ECB’s intervention?  In this crisis, the protective umbrella of all the European institutions, not just the ECB, has been crucial, especially for the most vulnerable countries. Our action has averted a debt crisis and the newly created €750 billion recovery fund has some very innovative elements, such as joint debt issuance and non-repayable grants, and is focused on the most vulnerable, most affected countries. In these countries, which include Spain, the actions of the European institutions – the ECB, the European Council and the European Commission – have undoubtedly limited the impact of a severe crisis and are driving the path to recovery, which we have to make the most of in the future.  In other words, the European institutions saved Spain.  The European institutions have acted as an extremely important protective umbrella. Without them, the crisis would have been worse because we would have had a debt crisis on top of the public health and economic crisis, but we managed to avoid that. This time, the European institutions have responded – they have been the main source of support to minimise the impact of the crisis.  Is Spain now doing its homework?  I don’t discuss national political issues. There was a very severe drop in GDP in the first half of the year, of up to 23%. This was all down to the lockdown and Spain’s production structure – the tourism and services sectors are very important. We expect a significant rebound in activity in Europe in the third quarter, just like what happened in May and June. And in Spain the recovery should be stronger, because the fall was also more severe. Ideally, we would avoid an uneven recovery across euro area countries, and this is why the recovery fund is so important, because it focuses on the countries that are considered to be most vulnerable.  That’s the ideal scenario, but is a stronger recovery in Spain to be expected?  With a drop [in GDP] of almost 23% in the first quarter, a very strong rebound is the most likely scenario in the third quarter, simply as a result of easing the lockdown.  How is a Government like Spain’s, with ministers from a far-left party like Unidas Podemos, seen by the ECB?  The ECB doesn’t make political comments of that kind. Personally, I usually say that the Spanish economy always surprises on the upside. Spain, like other vulnerable countries, has had lots of support from the EU institutions. Unlike what happened during the previous crisis, in terms of both purchases of Spanish public debt and what the recovery fund is going to provide, Europe is giving Spain its full support. And that’s extremely important. It’s not the only thing though, because the right economic policy must of course then be implemented.  Are you confident that the Spanish Government will implement the right economic policy?  It’s not about whether I’m confident or not. The only thing I want is for the right policies to be implemented. European institutions have provided vital support to tackle a terrible crisis. That has made it possible for the Spanish economy – both the public sector and the private sector – to continue to obtain funding at very favourable terms and it has prevented a debt crisis coming on top of the public health and economic crisis.  How many more bank mergers are needed in Europe?  Bank consolidation is one of the tools that can be used to address the low profitability of European banks, which have also been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and the economic crisis. There was already overcapacity, low profitability and inadequate cost structures before the pandemic and, in that environment, consolidation is a tool that can help. However, the ECB does not get involved in designing or determining any kind of specific [consolidation] operation.  Days before the merger between Caixabank and Bankia was announced, you said that you thought mergers were urgent and that they could happen quickly. Do you now anticipate cross-border mergers in the relatively near future?  The ECB calls in general terms for consolidation to be used as a helpful tool so that banks’ low profitability problems can at least be contained. It’s not about anticipating or not anticipating. The ECB – also in its role as supervisor – has identified that there is a vulnerability, a drop in profitability, and that consolidation can be an appropriate tool to try to change that situation. Low bank profitability is not a trivial matter and it has implications for how strong banks are. Of course, in a single European banking market, cross-border consolidation is one of the tools we call for [banks to use] to achieve the necessary improvement in profitability.  Does the ECB see that big cross-border merger on the horizon?  It’s not about us seeing it or not. We make recommendations for the banking sector overall, but it must be the banks themselves that make the decisions.  Will there be more mergers this year?  That’s not up to me. The ECB has repeatedly said that consolidation can play an important role, but it doesn’t dictate which banks should merge, neither domestically nor across borders.  Does the ECB plan to launch its own cryptocurrency?  We would be talking about a digital euro, if anything. An internal high-level taskforce at the ECB is analysing it, just like at other central banks. It’s an important issue for financial stability and monetary policy. There’s an underlying trend here, because the European economy is going to be increasingly digital, especially after the pandemic. At this stage we cannot say with any certainty whether there will be a digital euro or not, but it’s another element of an overall unstoppable trend. In any case, it would always be necessary to put in place the system that is most beneficial to euro area citizens.  Does the ECB have more power than governments?  The ECB’s power is a delegated power. Governments signed a treaty and we have to comply with that treaty. We are legally accountable to the European Court of Justice and institutionally accountable to the European Parliament.  So aren’t you and Christine Lagarde the two most powerful people in Europe?  I don’t think that’s the best way of describing it. What’s important is that we do our job well – and it’s not an easy one – at a very difficult time. And not just President Lagarde and me, but all of the Executive Board and the Governing Council too. We have a mandate and we will be judged based on how we fulfil that mandate, which was set by political authorities.  Sorry, but you are independent and you have the power to create and destroy money, which nobody else has.  We are independent and we decide which instruments are the most appropriate for us to fulfil our mandate, but that mandate is given to us. We are also accountable to the European Parliament in terms of how we use those instruments.  But who else in Europe can create and destroy money like you can?  That’s what happens with any central bank. By definition, central banks set monetary policy. That’s their role. And they do it independently because that is what has historically served citizens best. But it’s not a role that goes unchecked, as there is a mandate that we must respect. And that’s why the European Parliament, the European Court of Justice and, on a more operational level, the European Court of Auditors, also exercise their powers of oversight in relation to the ECB.

2020-09-18,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Challenges,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Pierre de La Rocque","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Challenges   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Pierre de La Rocque 18 September 2020  When you spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations in December 2018, you stated that gender parity in the workplace is a “revolutionary process” that must be achieved through the use of incentives, such as corporate or government quotas. Do you think that this “revolutionary” process is now a reality in most of the major institutions, businesses and governments?   There is a certain level of awareness now, but we’re only just getting started. Gender inequality still exists in terms of access to the job market and the pay gap. In OECD countries, the gender wage gap is still 13%. Women are working more and more but are still under-represented in management positions in both the private and public sectors. The coronavirus crisis has made the situation worse for women. Women make up almost 70% of the healthcare workforce; they are at greater risk from a health perspective. During lockdown, they have been active on all fronts, forced to work while caring for their children, not to mention coping with the threat of domestic violence. As in every economic crisis, they are at greater risk of losing their jobs or of having their wages cut.  The road towards gender parity in the workplace is anything but straight. It is a long-term process that requires vigilance at all times from every segment of society.   Is the process starting to produce results? As our report shows, women are finally gaining access to management positions. Are we witnessing the shattering of the glass ceiling, even though some institutions are still lagging significantly behind in terms of gender parity (and I am not just referring to the ECB Governing Council!)?   We have made some progress, but unfortunately there is a civil society consensus at international level that, given the still slow pace of advancement, any significant gains on the equality front will take decades rather than years to emerge – unless something changes. Even if one particular female director, or a company or organisation helps to bring about change, we cannot focus on this one achievement at the expense of the bigger picture. There are still too few women in management worldwide, particularly in the economic and financial spheres, including central banks. The 19 euro area central banks are run exclusively by men. Of the 25 members that make up the ECB Governing Council, Isabel Schnabel ‑ a member of the Executive Board ‑ and I are the only two women in the family photo. That’s not how it should be!   More generally, do you think that women have become more influential, even outside the institutions, firms or countries with female leaders?    I think that progress is being made within institutions, firms and countries and that people are acknowledging women’s ability to see things differently from men. We take a different approach to risk-taking, for example. You’ve often heard me say that if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters, the financial crisis of 2008 would no doubt have turned out differently. And the quality of a number of women leaders in the political or economic arena has certainly enabled better management of the unprecedented health crisis which we are now experiencing. But there are still too few women in positions of responsibility. More needs to be done in many areas. Just to give one example: we should encourage men to take paternity leave, and grant it to them for longer periods than their current entitlement of a few days or weeks.  And beyond the professional world, too, there is still quite a way to go, as is sadly evident from the prevalence of domestic violence and number of femicides.  Having long worked with (predominantly) male teams, do you see a change in men’s attitudes to women accessing top jobs?   Yes, men are definitely more accepting than before of women attaining the most senior positions, and corporate behaviour is beginning to change. Not only with regard to career paths, but also in day-to-day interaction between men and women. This is a valuable and necessary transformation; moreover, the younger generations are more aware of these issues. But the real change in mentality will come when nobody, male or female, questions the legitimacy of a woman holding a position of power.   Do you find it easier and more pleasant to have women around you?   What matters in a team is the diversity of backgrounds and profiles and the complementarity of its members. Gender is a part of this necessary diversity, but it’s not the sole criterion.   In your view, are there still cultural, ideological or religious barriers in some countries which are impeding this “revolution” to bring about gender parity at work. Isn’t it true that women have fewer rights than men in some societies?   Yes, there are all kinds of barriers. Take legal barriers for a start. I suggest you read the most recent World Bank report on the subject. On average, women around the world enjoy only three-quarters of the rights afforded to men. Legal inequities are still enshrined in laws, even in certain constitutions, in matrimonial law, inheritance law, the signing of contracts and access to credit. Much progress has been made over the past 50 years – and France is well-placed in this respect – but in general, at global level, there is still a long way to go! Female emancipation boosts productivity and economic development. That is an established and documented fact. So, what are we waiting for?    "
2020-09-16,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Agence France-Presse (AFP),"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Philippe Lacour","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Agence France-Presse (AFP)   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Philippe Lacour 16 September 2020  While the current rise of the euro is recognised as an element that can reduce inflation, the ECB claims there must be “no complacency” when it comes to reaching the objective of price stability. Will a verbal intervention be enough to prevent the euro from continuing to rise?  We are not targeting the exchange rate. We adjust our policies according to the medium-term inflation outlook. And at the last Governing Council meeting there was still an exceptionally high level of uncertainty. As President Lagarde explained at the press conference, it was the Governing Council’s view that more information was needed on how the pandemic evolves, how our measures transmit to the real economy and how persistent exchange rate movements would ultimately prove to be. We continue monitoring incoming information carefully, including developments in the exchange rate, and we stand ready to act if the incoming data is not consistent with the objective of our emergency measures to close the inflation gap that has emerged as a result of the pandemic.  Eurozone unemployment is increasing rapidly, core inflation reached historic lows in August, the pandemic is gathering pace. Yet the ECB is a little less gloomy about the economic outlook than three months ago. How does that fit together?  We do not see a V-shaped economic development where we return to the pre-crisis path very quickly. Instead, we see a protracted recovery that takes time, and the same is true for the inflation outlook. Regarding inflation, we never base our decisions on just one month of data; we focus on how it evolves over the medium term. We see that our measures provide tangible support to core inflation, which was, however, partly offset by other factors.   Eurozone citizens often feel that prices are climbing faster than official inflation data suggest. Do you think this misunderstanding can harm public support for ECB policies?  This has indeed been observed in many countries, so it must be taken seriously. This perception has mainly to do with the fact that households buy goods relatively more often for which prices have gone up more quickly – take food, for example – and they don’t really perceive that the prices of other goods, which actually have quite a bit of weight in the consumption basket, have increased by much less. I think that there is a need to communicate this better and to also work on a better understanding of what the inflation rate actually measures.   Do you see the ECB imitating the Fed, which listened to the public and concluded that it will now aim for an “average inflation target”?  In our monetary policy strategy review, which has just been resumed, we will also listen carefully to the different stakeholders. As far as the monetary policy strategy is concerned, the euro area differs from the United States in several important aspects, starting with the mandate. We also have a different economic structure and our financial system is much more bank-based. We will review our strategy with an open mind but it could well be that we do not end up with the same strategy as the Fed.   Could some of the emergency fiscal actions by governments in response to the COVID-19 crisis increase the risk of a “zombification” of a part of the economy?   We are still in the middle of the pandemic – this requires a lot of support from the fiscal, as well as from the monetary side. This has helped viable firms to survive. It would be dangerous to end the fiscal support prematurely. This mistake was made before and I don’t think we should repeat that.  But we’re all aware that the crisis will bring structural change. In addition, we are facing secular challenges, such as the green and the digital transition, which will require support by fiscal policy. Therefore, it would be a mistake to try to preserve the pre-pandemic economic structure. Instead, we have to make sure that the crisis measures support the transition to a sustainable growth path.   Can the public debt held by the ECB at some point undermine its independence?   Even after years of asset purchases, the ECB is holding a relatively small share of outstanding government debt on its balance sheet. The bond free float, i.e. the share of bonds that is held outside of the Eurosystem, amounts to close to 80% when taking into account the maturity structure of outstanding government debt.   What do you say to those, in France in particular, who advocate the cancellation or the perpetualisation of the public debt held by the ECB?  The simple answer is that it is prohibited by the Treaty, because this would clearly constitute monetary financing. We are guided by our price stability mandate and we are not allowed to finance governments.  But when the ECB claims that it will replace the maturing public bonds with new purchases, isn’t that the same as converting them into perpetual debt?  No, because these reinvestments are limited to a specific time period or are contingent on a sustained return of inflation to our aim, implying that purchases are not unlimited.  Regarding Brexit, how concerned are you about a no deal that is likely to weigh on economic activity?  A no-deal Brexit would be harmful for everybody, especially for the United Kingdom, but also for the euro area. I would encourage the negotiating parties to work hard on avoiding that outcome. In any case it’s important that financial institutions and other market participants are prepared in the event of a no-deal scenario.    "
2020-08-31,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt on 28 August 2020 and published on 31 August 2020","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi and Frank Siebelt on 28 August 2020 and published on 31 August 2020 31 August 2020  Could you please update us on your assessment of economic developments over the summer?   We now have the numbers for the second quarter and they showed a decline in GDP of 12.1% (quarter-on-quarter). That’s of course very large, but it’s close to our projection of -13%. If you look at incoming data, by and large they support the baseline of our June projections. It remains the case that uncertainty is exceptionally high. But overall, I believe that we are still close to the baseline. That means we expect a strong rebound in the third quarter, even if that rebound will not be strong enough to put us back to where we started. So, there will be a protracted recovery, much in line with what we projected in June.  Does that mean you don’t expect fundamental changes in staff projections on 10 September?   I don’t want to pre-empt that. At the moment, the baseline continues to look plausible. Overall, the speed and strength of the recovery will be determined by the containment of the virus. This is the single most important factor. We are seeing a certain resurgence of infections, but at the moment it looks unlikely that we are going to see a full lockdown again. This is precisely what we assumed in our baseline scenario in June.   Given all this, what does that mean for ECB policy? Are you comfortable with your policy stance or do you need to revisit it in September?  Our policies were calibrated based on the June projections. We had a big increase in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at that time due to a very subdued inflation outlook. Our policies are data-driven. As long as the baseline scenario remains intact, there is no reason to adjust the monetary policy stance. Of course, the projections will play an important role going forward. But at the moment the PEPP envelope looks appropriate.  The ECB accounts suggest a debate on whether the entire PEPP envelope needs to be used in full. What’s your view on this?   We calibrated the amount based on the June projections, and under that baseline scenario the envelope will be used in full. There could be surprises, both on the upside and the downside, which may mean that we have to reconsider our monetary policy stance. But at the moment, that’s not on the cards.   Interpreting your words, it appears that you remain comfortable with both the policy stance and the projections.  Yes, but let’s wait for the ECB staff projections in September.  In the account of the last meeting, you appeared to warn that some market optimism may not be justified by economic data. Where do you see undue exuberance?   We have seen a very strong recovery in global stock markets, more so in the United States than in the euro area, and we’re analysing this. It’s interesting to look at where this is coming from in the euro area. The initial drop in stocks was, to a great extent, driven by an increase in risk premia. But this has been largely reversed due to the policy measures taken on the fiscal and monetary side. At the same time, earnings expectations have come down.  Overall, what we’re seeing is that stocks are strongly driven by changes in risk premia. This means there is a return of confidence, also reflecting beliefs that fiscal and monetary policies remain supportive. On the one hand, this evolution of stock prices is good because it eases financial conditions, but on the other hand there’s a risk of repricing.  I would also like to stress that many investors remain more cautious. We have seen large inflows into money market funds and there’s strong demand for gold, which suggests there’s also demand for hedging.  The ECB’s asset purchases have come off their highs. How should we read that decrease? How much of this is seasonality and how much is improved market conditions?   We always stress that one shouldn’t overinterpret short-term changes in purchase volumes. But you are right that seasonality patterns play a role. Market conditions also play a role and they have improved quite a bit. But you must not forget that the PEPP has a dual role. First, it has a role in market stabilisation related to the risk of fragmentation and, on that side, we’ve seen a substantial improvement. Second, the PEPP is also there to close the inflation gap created by the pandemic. If you look at this stance element of the PEPP, since the inflation outlook is quite subdued there is clearly a need to remain active in the market.  Do you expect PEPP purchases to come back into line with the capital key? Will it be at the end of the PEPP or earlier?  We haven’t discussed this. But as a rule of thumb I would say that the stronger the stance element of the PEPP, the smaller the capital key deviations. When it comes to the monetary policy stance, there is no need to deviate from the capital key. Deviations are driven by the need to counter the risk of fragmentation. As the risk of fragmentation is going down, there is less of a need to deviate from the capital key.   The PEPP was meant to counter an unjustified rise in yields. Is the current market pricing justified?   This is part of the flexibility of the PEPP, which is fundamental for its effectiveness. There’s flexibility across jurisdictions, asset classes and over time, and we’ve made use of this flexibility, especially at the height of the crisis. The initial tightening of financial conditions has largely reversed and the risk of fragmentation has come down quite a bit. Spreads have come down substantially. A good part of this is due to our monetary policy actions. But we shouldn’t forget that action on the fiscal side, especially at European level, played a very important role as well.   Is the ECB providing guidance to the EU on how to design its joint debt issuance?  We’re not involved in that process. But I’m sure the European Commission will look very carefully at our eligibility criteria. If the bonds are eligible, we can buy them, and our current policy foresees that 10% of our purchases, both under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and under the public sector part of the PEPP, are for supranational debt.   Once this bond is issued, should we expect a surge in purchases, or will you reduce purchases elsewhere?  The envelope is set according to our monetary policy goals. The envelope is not calculated based on issuance. It’s calibrated in order to close the inflation gap and we have rules on how this is distributed across the different segments, although there is some flexibility.  One should be aware that the largest part of the EU issuance may come after the currently foreseen end of the PEPP’s net purchase phase. But of course, the PSPP would, in any case, still be there at that time.  If the largest part of net issuance comes after the end of the PEPP, wouldn’t that mean you will be bound or pushed by markets to extend the programme?  Markets always try to push us. But we have a clear way in how we design our policy. We take the decisions, not the markets.   Do you remain comfortable with the tiering multiplier?  The introduction of the tiering system was quite a success. We managed to maintain the desired degree of accommodation while reducing the burden for banks. We could adjust the tiering multiplier as well as the remuneration of the exempted tier. But at the moment, we are looking at how the decisions that we’ve taken are working through the system. So we have not yet discussed an adjustment in those parameters. We are monitoring it and there may be a point where we decide to do something about it, but that point hasn’t come yet.  What’s your expectation for the next tender of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs)? And more broadly, do you think there is a need to extend the facility? Could or should the ECB make it a permanent facility?  In the first round of TLTROs at the new very favourable conditions, we saw a historically high take-up. There was a clear incentive to participate early. There will probably be some further take-up, but nothing comparable to what we saw in June. But even if the take-up in future operations is not that big, it’s important that these facilities are there so banks can be sure they have access to them if needed. There’s no plan to make them permanent, though. What is permanent in monetary policy? You have to adjust to what is happening in the economy.  The euro has appreciated substantially, both against the US dollar and also on a trade-weighted basis. What’s the implication of this appreciation?   We are not targeting the exchange rate, but we are monitoring foreign exchange developments. My reading of the depreciation of the US dollar is that it is also a sign of the return of global confidence. What we have seen is a reversal of previous safe-haven flows. This is actually a good sign. For the euro area, I think another positive development is that the agreement on the EU Recovery Fund has increased confidence in the stability of the euro area. This would also have a strengthening effect on the euro exchange rate, even though I would say that this effect is smaller than the global confidence effect. How all this translates into inflation is not entirely clear. We know that the pass-through of exchange rates depends very much on the circumstances and the underlying shocks. I would also be cautious in interpreting the exchange rate changes in isolation, because research shows that if there is a depreciation of the US dollar, this tends to boost global trade and global growth. So even though there may be a competitiveness effect for euro area corporates, there is an effect working through global trade, which may actually compensate for that. At the moment I am not worrying too much about exchange rate developments.  The outcome of the Federal Reserve’s policy review implies that it will be raising interest rates slower than in the past, and this could also lead to a depreciation of the US dollar. What’s your initial view on the outcome of the Fed’s review?  I am not commenting on what the Fed has been doing. They have done, as we are going to do, a comprehensive review. And I am sure they have done a very careful job in trying to find out what is the best thing to do for the Fed. But let me also stress that what is best for the Fed is not necessarily best for the ECB, because we have a different economic structure, financial sector structure, history of monetary policy actions and mandate. That being said, there is global interdependence.   Will you change your inflation target as part of your own review? Will it be more symmetrical?  The review is now starting again and I cannot pre-empt the results. But we said from the very beginning that this review will be comprehensive and open. We will consider all the options. That means that we are also open to adjusting our definition of price stability, but I cannot tell you how. I think it’s clear that the medium-term perspective has served us well. I would think this will be maintained. I would also say that communication matters a lot, even more than in the past. So I think we should have a target that can be easily communicated.  Climate change has gained more prominence in the review. What can you do on the market side to promote green assets? You said in the past that you would not favour skewing asset purchases towards green assets. Do you maintain this view?   Climate change is probably the biggest challenge we are facing, much bigger than the pandemic. The pandemic has shown what it means to have a severe global shock that hits the entire world simultaneously. This also has implications for the question of how to deal with climate change. We have seen that even though this health shock was entirely unrelated to monetary policy, it nevertheless has huge implications for monetary policy. The same is true for climate change and this is why central banks cannot ignore it. It is such an important challenge and it has direct effects on our ability to maintain price stability. This is why we have to ask ourselves what we can do within the boundaries of our mandate. This is also why we think climate change should play a prominent role in the monetary policy strategy review. There are some areas that are uncontroversial. For example, the investment of our own portfolio, of course we can do a lot there. We also have to start to integrate climate risks into our economic models and see how that works out. We have to think about climate risk assessment, which has potentially big implications for banking supervision. It can also have implications for the setting of haircuts in our collateral framework. This is another important area that I think should be rather uncontroversial.  The most controversial part is probably the question that you raised, whether purchases for monetary policy purposes should be biased towards green bonds. The first thing to note is that, at the moment, the scope for that is limited because the green segment in the bond market is very small. We are already holding around 20% of the eligible green universe. Therefore, the most important thing is that there is more issuance of green bonds, which would then automatically lead to higher purchases of green bonds.  One idea that I have been pushing a bit in recent months is the idea of a green capital markets union. The idea is to combine the whole reform process for capital markets union with the green transition. I think there is a huge potential there for Europe. It would help a lot and would also – in an uncontroversial way – allow us to buy more green bonds.  The question of whether we should bias our purchases will have to be discussed. There are different views. There is the view that we should stick very closely to market neutrality. And there is the alternative view that markets are not pricing climate risks properly, so there is a market distortion and therefore market neutrality may not actually be the right benchmark.  My thinking about this is also developing and we will have to have that discussion in the monetary policy strategy review.  Could you change the eligibility criteria for bonds in your collateral framework to shift towards a “greener” policy? This could be done, for example, by clauses which make assets eligible only if the issuers have stated their climate risks clearly.  I think that is an interesting idea. Whatever we want to do in that area, we first have to understand what “green” actually means. First steps have been taken in the context of the EU taxonomy. But much more is needed. The second thing we need is disclosure. What you said is basically that, even if we don’t go as far as saying that certain companies are excluded, we could at least require disclosure as a first step.   Could you give us more of your thoughts on the green capital markets union?  Capital markets union is an area where there is broad consensus, but progress has been relatively slow. The reason for this is that we have financial structures in place that work reasonably well, so it’s difficult to shift towards a new system that is more market-based. But in the context of the green transition, we will have to rebuild financial markets in a green way. There will be a kind of copy of the existing financial markets in green. And when you build something new, that is much easier than changing a system that is already in place. I think this would really be a big chance for the EU to move in this direction.   What are your broad conclusions about the pandemic’s impact on our economy?   We are facing a tremendous shock, and this shock has long-lasting structural effects. This of course has an important impact on our monetary policy. Research shows that pandemics are historically followed by a further fall in the natural real interest rate. And this poses a challenge for monetary policy because this then means that we are again pushed towards the lower bound. We have to take that very seriously. This is also why I think the pandemic will have an important impact on the monetary policy strategy review. The macroeconomic backdrop has changed quite a bit since the previous review in 2003. Now there is another change and therefore this will have an impact.  Research actually shows that the natural interest rate decreases for a very long time after pandemics. Are you concerned about this?   This is not a given. Whether this happens depends, crucially, on how policy reacts, especially fiscal policy. This is why I think the EU Recovery Fund is so important, and in particular whether this money is spent wisely on projects that raise potential growth and foster the green transition and the transition to a digital economy. But it could happen if the policy response is inappropriate.  There is renewed discussion about TARGET2 balances. Do you still agree that a rise in German claims is mostly a factor of the asset purchase programmes?  The quick answer is that TARGET2 balances are very much in line with what would be expected from the asset purchases. I do not see any deviation there. There is also no evidence of continued capital flight from TARGET2 liability countries. In June, there have actually been net debt inflows. That means this is nothing we should really worry about.  Do you expect to meet in person in September?  The original plan was to meet in person. This may have to be revised.   "
2020-08-27,Philip R. Lane,Interview with CNBC,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Steve Liesman on 27 August 2020 and broadcast on 27 August 2020","   INTERVIEW  Interview with CNBC   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Steve Liesman on 27 August 2020 and broadcast on 27 August 2020 27 August 2020  The eurozone fell a little bit less than the United States in the first quarter, fell a little bit more in the second quarter. I’m talking about GDP. Tell us where you think the eurozone is right now when it comes to recovery and where you think it’s going.  What we’ve seen over the summer is more or less in line with our baseline projections. So in our baseline – like everywhere – the second quarter was going to be the worst quarter. By the way, within the second quarter, the worst month would have been April. We’ve had a very big fall in output, but also week by week, the recovery is happening. But let me emphasise that there’s still a long way to go. In terms of growth rates, we think the third quarter is going to see quite a strong growth rate, but the growth rate doesn’t mean so much in this world where you follow two quarters of very negative performance, it’s going to take a number of quarters of positive performance to get back to where we were. Our baseline was built around that once the economy was unlocked there would be some recovery, but the reality is that while we still have to manage this virus in terms of social distancing and other restrictions, there’s not going to be a return to normal levels of economic activity for a considerable period.  There was a good spurt of growth that you had, with numbers actually outperforming earlier this summer. Now you’ve had a bit of a return of the virus. Are you starting to be more pessimistic about what’s going to happen in the fall?  I think our baseline was based on a concept of bumpiness; that we would have zigs and zags, that it was not going to be the case that the dynamic of managing the pandemic would be perfectly linear, where progress is made and maintained. The study of past pandemics shows that essentially you’re going to have localised outbreaks recurrently. The big challenge now is to make sure that these outbreaks are dealt with promptly, in as localised a manner as makes sense in order to avoid a generalised lockdown. You would think that this is what we expected, but of course the more the authorities can really make sure that the virus is contained as much as possible, that’s the most important policy objective for the economy.  Philip, just two more questions here. Is the European Central Bank prepared to do more? And if so, what more could it do? It’s already created a very large loan fund and already is at negative interest rates. Is there more in the ECB’s arsenal? Is it prepared to use it?  We signalled all along that we’re absolutely standing ready as needed, so we’ve made a lot of policy moves between March and June and we stand ready to do more as needed. I think what you may have come to learn in these months is that central banks have a lot of capability. Even in this world where interest rates are low or negative, there’s a lot that we central banks can do. This is not to say the central banks can solve all the problems. We have a very limited role compared to fiscal policy in this environment. But within our mandate, within our remit, I would not be concerned about the room for action. We can definitely step up as needed.   "
2020-07-31,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Le Courrier Cauchois,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, conducted by Dominique Lecoq and Marc Aubault on 29 July and published on 31 July ","   INTERVIEW 31 July 2020  Interview with Le Courrier Cauchois   Interview with Christine Lagarde, conducted by Dominique Lecoq and Marc Aubault on 29 July and published on 31 July   How has the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis affected you personally? And where have you been? In Frankfurt? In Paris? Or in Normandy?  I was based in Frankfurt, of course, and have spent most of this period in lockdown. I was in Frankfurt for eight weeks straight. At that time, all of the bank’s staff were asked to telework, and I have been teleworking, too. We’ve organised most meetings, including Governing Council meetings, via teleworking. To give you an example, the €750 billion plan was decided on 18 March 2020… at my kitchen table! People picture large boardrooms with men in suits, but that’s not how it is…We’ve explored every technological avenue to keep working remotely. With hindsight, it’s worked fairly well. This has been an especially intense time for me. We acted swiftly as the first line of defence in a situation where the economy was giving way beneath our feet. We were rapidly confronted with huge liquidity demands.  The ECB has taken strong action. You already talked about it – launching a “pandemic emergency” asset purchase programme to the tune of €750 billion, which you increased to €1,350 billion in June. It has also provided more than €1,300 billion of loans to European banks at negative rates…  The €1,350 billion of asset purchases make up a temporary, flexible envelope that has a very important role – it aims to stabilise the euro area economy and avoid financial fragmentation. As for the envelope of loans, not all of it has been allocated yet. These are targeted loans for the real economy, with very attractive rates. We want to encourage banks to continue lending in the same volumes as they were before the crisis. At the same time, the French state – like other euro area governments – has provided guarantees for these loans. It has said to banks: “If you lend to company X, we offer you our guarantee against the risk of default, and the ECB is allowing you to fund this loan at a very attractive rate.” So banks reap a double benefit here: ECB funding at very low rates, and a state guarantee. This means there is minimal credit risk. It had to be done. Otherwise there was a risk that the banks would turn off the taps. So with the banks as an intermediary, relaxing our financing conditions benefits small and medium-sized enterprises and the self-employed as much as large companies.  Despite all of this support, Léa Lassarat and Vincent Laudat, the presidents of the Seine Estuaire and Rouen Métropole Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCI), are concerned that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises will go bankrupt in the autumn, and that large companies will struggle in 2021. What do you say to local and regional employers about these concerns?  This is a real risk. Which is why the ECB decided in June to increase the volume of its asset purchases from €750 billion to €1,350 billion, to continue these purchases at least until June 2021 (the original end date was the end of 2020), and to reinvest the maturing securities at least until the end of 2022. We should envisage support continuing beyond 2020. We really have to maintain a safety net and very attractive conditions at least until June 2021.  You said to the Washington Post that female politicians had done a better job of managing the COVID-19 crisis. How do you explain that?  Perhaps for historical or sociological reasons, I don’t know, women have developed an array of specific talents that are indispensable in crisis situations.  It is essential that more women are included in politics and economics, including at the highest levels. Among the leaders who have managed the crisis well, the proportion of women is much higher than the proportion of female leaders overall. That is a fact. But I’m not excluding men, some of whom have also managed the crisis very well.  You also want the ECB to participate in the fight against climate change…  Everyone should ask themselves what role they can play in the fight against climate change. What goes for individuals in their day-to-day activities also goes for institutions. Institutions should ask themselves how they can participate in the fight against climate change, which is one of the greatest threats to our planet and to future generations. Institutions like the ECB produce economic analyses, provide banks with funding opportunities and purchase assets. In all of these areas they can think hard about how to incorporate climate change considerations. The first area is economic analysis. If we don’t take climate change into account, how can we draw up our projections? The increased frequency of major natural disasters and the sharp increase in insurance premiums, for example, have a direct impact on economic projections. The effects of climate change will have implications for price stability and inflation, which lie at the heart of the ECB’s mandate.  The second area is bank funding. We should be able to ask banks if they have considered climate change in their loan assessments. For example, four large European banks have decided that they will stop financing coal production by 2030. Firms will need to be supported in making their transition. But financing fossil fuels will become more costly. The third area is asset purchases. These fall into three groups: the ECB’s own portfolio, the retirement scheme for ECB staff, which is already very green, and the large asset purchase programmes. As part of our strategy review we will explore ways of taking the risk of climate change into account.  Where does your green sensibilities stem from? From the Pays de Caux countryside where you have your home?   I’ve always been close to nature. I have lived in Hautot-le-Vatois for more than 30 years. The house belonging to my mother, who came from Normandy, was “across the water” [across the River Seine]-. My grandmother was originally from La Couture-Boussey in l'Eure. When I was small, we used to fetch milk from the farm in a jug and look for eggs in the henhouse. I called my grandmother “Mamie Cocotte”. And I often went camping in the Normandy countryside with the Brownies and the Girl Guides.  What is your attachment to the Pays de Caux?  For me, the Pays de Caux represents my whole childhood and adolescence. My parents arrived here when I was just two or three years old.  What are your favourite spots?  My house, in Hautot-le-Vatois, in the heart of the Pays de Caux. It’s a place I love dearly and where I feel very happy. I am surrounded by very kind neighbours who have become almost like family. When I was a lawyer in Paris, I returned here every weekend. I would travel by train with my two sons and return on Sunday evening. One of my sons has always loved this place. When my other son was around 16 or 17 he found it a little too isolated … But he got married recently and came here with his wife during the lockdown. After two months, he said to me: ""it’s absolutely marvellous!"". He has fallen in love with it  I also love going to Saint-Valéry-en-Caux, Veules-les-Roses and Veulettes-sur-Mer, to eat mussels and frites while enjoying the sea view. And Varengeville-sur-Mer! It’s a divine place. That’s where I would like to be buried.  And we could come across you in Yvetot where you often do your shopping. Like this Wednesday morning (29 July) at the market…  I am rarely here on Wednesdays. This week is an exception because I am working here in mid-summmer. I usually go to the market in Yvetot on Saturday mornings. The locals always say hello to me. The people of this region are reserved and respectful but truely warm-hearted. I also inspect the prices from time to time. Having such a fascination for inflation, I like to make a few on-the-spot checks …(smiles).  You also have links to Le Havre, where you went to school…  My father had started his career at the Lycée François 1er in Le Havre, so I was able to complete my primary schooling there. At that time, I was one of two girls in a class of 35 boys! I then went to Raoul-Dufy, a girls’ school where my mother was teaching, and then to the Lycée Claude Monet.  Are you still in contact with people in Le Harve?  Yes, I have friends still living in Le Havre. Some of them never moved away while others left Le Havre and returned there for their retirement. It has become a different world. I adore this town with its extraordinary openness to the sea.  Do you like other places in Normandy, in former Lower Normandy? Manche, for example?  I like Deauville, Cabourg, Honfleur, all of those magnificant promenades – off-season – the D-Day landing beaches. But I’m not familiar with Saint-Lô, the Cotentin Peninsula or Mont-Saint-Michel. Parents now take their children to these places. But when I was young, there was neither the Normandy Bridge nor the Tancarville Bridge, which I saw being constructed. You had to take a ferry so we stayed on our own side. But I did visit Avranches several times for synchronised swimming competitions and a water polo tournment in the years from 1968 to 1974. We travelled there by coach. These are happy memories...   "
2020-07-27,Fabio Panetta,Interview with La Repubblica,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni and published on 27 July 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 27 July 2020  Interview with La Repubblica   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni and published on 27 July 2020   The European Union has approved a recovery fund of €750 billion and an ambitious multiannual budget. What do you think of the agreement?  It could mark a turning point. If we look back in 20 years’ time, the past few months might look like the start of a new phase in European integration. The approval of the recovery fund was a necessary decision to meet the economic challenges facing Europe. But, above all, it is a decision that shows awareness, including on the part of countries that were initially lukewarm to the agreement, of the need for a common response and the benefits – for everyone – of providing that response. Whether the decisions taken in recent weeks really mark a turning point will depend on the economic policies adopted by individual countries. Italy bears a great responsibility. The EU has given Italy access to significant credit. Now the country must show it’s capable of using that European funding to address the structural weaknesses in its economy.  You’ve written that an inadequate European fiscal response would have placed the single market at risk. Did the “Frugal Four” underestimate this danger?  One thing that struck me in the European negotiations was that, after a really heated discussion, all the leaders went home and claimed victory. In fact, they were right to do so. We did all win, because all of our countries can benefit from a common response that fosters the recovery of the European economy. By acting together, we’ve generated a sort of ‘European dividend’. The eurozone economy is interconnected from a trade and financial perspective, and the recovery of any single part of it has positive repercussions on growth and jobs throughout the area. Export-oriented countries like Germany or the Netherlands are aware of the benefits of the single currency. If a shock arises that is not caused by imprudent policies, it’s in the common interest to help kick-start the European economy.  Do the geopolitical situation, the United States’ neo-protectionism and tensions with China, as well as the growing nationalism in Europe suggest that the European Single Market should be preserved and safeguarded even more than in the past?  Even before the pandemic, it was clear that multilateralism was in crisis as a result of policies adopted outside the EU. The tendency to base international relations on bilateral relationships benefits those regions that are economically strongest. European integration can ensure that the voices of countries that – on their own – would have limited relevance in a global context, are heard. But we need to build an economic area in which all countries can proceed at a similar pace.    Some people fear that Germany will emerge stronger from the crisis, and Europe more unequal. Do you still see this as a risk, now that agreement has been reached on the recovery fund?   Even countries less badly affected by the pandemic, and that would have had the means not just to tackle the crisis but also to benefit from it – and here I’m thinking precisely of Germany – have taken ownership of the joint initiative. Without the Franco-German engine driving things forward, there would have been no recovery fund. In the past Germany has been reluctant to adopt common recovery policies, but in this case it has looked beyond short-term national interests and provided a decisive impetus for policies that can lessen economic divergences between countries. Now we need an adequate response from the economically weaker countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis.  How do you view the role played by Angela Merkel, who in the past has often been accused of doing “too little, too late” for Europe?  The shift in favour of Europe occurred at two key moments. The first was the prompt intervention by the European Central Bank (ECB), which prevented a devastating crisis and afforded the time needed for a European solution to take shape. The second was the announcement of the recovery fund by Chancellor Merkel and President Macron. And let’s not forget the role played by the European Commission: it drew up the proposal for a recovery fund, which then emerged essentially intact from the subsequent debate. The response to the crisis came primarily from European institutions (the ECB, the Council and the Commission), moving beyond the intergovernmental approach followed during the sovereign debt crisis. We have devised a European response to a European problem. And it’s working.  In the recovery fund, the balance between grants and loans has been shifted strongly in favour of the latter. Do you think that’s a problem?   Ultimately, the €750 billion are still there. Yes, some people wanted more grants, others more loans. But let’s remember where we were four months ago. A solution like the one achieved in the last few days was inconceivable at that time. It has gone very well.  The EU will be issuing a huge volume of debt. Is this another epoch-making landmark?  Yes, issuing this amount of debt is a fundamental change. It marks progress towards a genuine capital markets union and will make the euro area more attractive to international investors. In the past capital inflows to the euro area mainly concerned just a few countries and de facto accentuated divergences. That won’t happen this time round, because the capital will be able to flow towards securities issued jointly, the proceeds of which will be used to finance the economy of the entire euro area. The euro area is becoming more normal.  A lot of money will be coming to Italy, but our partners expect reforms. What are the priorities?  The Italian economy has been stagnating for decades. Italy missed the boat with the technological revolution and hasn’t invested enough in developing human capital. The delays and weaknesses accumulated over time are well known. Now there is a chance to use European funds to modernise the economy and to make it more respectful of the environment, more digitalised and more inclusive. It is possible to reduce – through growth and jobs, and not just subsidies – the inequalities that have emerged in recent years. Southern Italy is a critical challenge. I struggle to imagine a balanced development of an economy in which the per capita income of one-third of the population is half that of the rest of the country, where entire regions are afflicted by widespread unemployment and lack of infrastructure. The introduction of a favourable tax regime in southern Italy is being actively discussed. This is an ambitious goal, which I examined previously during my time at the Banca d’Italia. It will need to be assessed at both the national and European levels in view of its implications for public finances and competition. But it’s a project that could significantly contribute to the recovery of southern Italy’s economy.  The money from the recovery fund won’t arrive until next year. In the meantime would it be right for Italy to seek funding from the European Stability Mechanism?  I think it’s necessary to hold an objective and informed debate on whether it’s appropriate to use the low-cost resources made available by Europe, including those provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), for health expenditure, especially in the light of the ongoing risk of a second wave of infections. The ESM and the European Commission have published all the information on the conditions offered by the ESM on their websites. This information is public and can be analysed by experts, of which there is no shortage in the Italian public administration. When all the implications of applying to the ESM have been fully clarified, I’m sure the government and Parliament will take the right decision.   What effect have the special measures adopted by the ECB to tackle the paralysis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had?  These measures were needed to prevent financial markets running out of oxygen and to support consumption and investment by households and businesses. If we had tolerated a tightening of financial conditions, the already very serious crisis we expect to see this year would have been even worse, with unpredictable consequences. The ECB took action to prevent financial fragmentation in the euro area and safeguard its monetary policy transmission mechanism. In that way, we have protected the production capacity of the European economy. Without our measures, the pandemic would have pushed inflation well below 2%. By the end of 2022, we estimate that the measures decided since March – both the purchase programmes and the refinancing operations – will produce a cumulative increase of 0.8 percentage points in inflation and 1.3 percentage points in GDP. We’re seeing a normalisation of the cost of financing the economy, which is a necessary condition to prevent the crisis intensifying.  So is the euro area out of danger?  It’s too soon to declare victory. In the first quarter GDP in the euro area experienced a very sharp contraction of 3.6% compared with the previous three months. In the second quarter things will get worse, and the contraction will be more acute. Recent data certainly indicate that we’re making progress: in May industrial production grew by 12% and retail sales by 18%; qualitative indicators such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index are also improving. But we need to view these improvements with caution, because they are an effect of the rebound that was to be expected after the earlier disastrous fall in economic activity and reflect the large-scale intervention of economic policies. Moreover, they don’t diverge from our forecasts. So they don’t give us sufficient grounds for satisfaction.  Economic activity is still well below pre-crisis levels and, on the basis of our projections, we won’t see a return to those levels before the end of 2022. There is also uncertainty over the outlook for the economy and for jobs. Finally, growth is uneven: the last thing we need is for divergences between countries to be accentuated, because if that were to happen monetary policy implementation would become pretty difficult. And let’s not forget that we don’t know how the pandemic is going to evolve: in a number of countries there is still the risk of a second wave. Until we’re sure that the effects of the crisis have been reabsorbed we will need to go on providing a strong monetary stimulus to consolidate the recovery, thus bringing the inflation level back up.  But would a second wave, a second lockdown, be sustainable for the euro area?  I can’t make predictions about a phenomenon that I’ve never experienced before and that I could never have imagined living through. However, it’s important to underscore that the health authorities have gained valuable experience to manage any future emergencies. In addition, the euro area countries have tackled the pandemic decisively and effectively. This applies to Italy too, even though, as the first European country to be badly hit, it wasn’t able to draw on other countries’ experiences.  Might the ECB decide to deploy only part of the firepower of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), as some members of the Governing Council have suggested?   When we approved the extension of the PEPP in June, our projections were no different from at present. So I expect we’ll use the resources available under the programme in full unless there are significant upside surprises. We can take advantage of the flexibility envisaged by the PEPP by changing the distribution of purchases over time, across different asset classes or across countries. So far, we’ve only done this to a limited degree, as our interventions have been effective. The programme is working well, and I don’t see any economic reasons to change our decisions or actions.  Christine Lagarde claims that the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) are working and that credit is flowing to businesses. Can you explain to us what’s happening in the banking world, which was the first to collapse during the financial crisis?  We need to remember that this crisis was not triggered by the financial sector, but by a health emergency. In addition, the ECB acted promptly, and with very powerful measures. We’re now providing funding for banks at negative rates that can be as low as -1%, but on one condition: that banks in turn use this financing to provide credit to households and businesses. This is a strong incentive, and the scope of the measures is very broad: through TLTROs, we can deliver nearly €3,000 billion of funding to banks. Intermediaries are making ample use of this facility and are markedly increasing lending to the economy. In the quarter from March to May the growth in loans to businesses was the highest since the launch of the single currency: about €250 billion for the euro area and €22 billion for Italy. And banks are issuing loans at very low rates, on average below 1.5%.  What risks are banks facing? Looking forward, do you see a new wave of non-performing loans?  Banks are starting from a better capital position than in 2008, when the financial crisis broke out. The ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to risk-weighted assets is just below 15%. But if the recession were to persist, banks would find themselves having to cope with a sharp deterioration in credit risk and a resurgence of impaired and bad loans. We need to kick-start the economy quickly, before we find ourselves in that situation. For this reason too the measures decided by the ECB are of fundamental importance.  Some commentators are complaining about low interest rates, which they say could harm savings and put pension funds, insurance companies and banks at risk. But it’s not as if low interest rates exist only in Europe.   You’re right, low rates are a global phenomenon, not a European one. They’re the result mainly of structural factors, such as the ageing population, surplus savings with respect to investment opportunities and a shortage of risk-free assets. In the euro area, low growth had an impact, as did the accommodative monetary policies linked to inflation trends. But imagine what would have happened if the ECB hadn’t adopted expansionary monetary policy measures. Growth and inflation would have collapsed, and savers and intermediaries would have suffered a great deal more. Employment and lower income citizens would have been hit hardest.     "
2020-07-26,Luis de Guindos,Interview with El Independiente,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Casimiro García Abadillo on 21 July 2020 and published on 26 July 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 26 July 2020  Interview with El Independiente   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Casimiro García Abadillo on 21 July 2020 and published on 26 July 2020   What do you make of the agreement reached in the early hours of Tuesday morning to launch a European recovery fund?  It is a good deal. It sends the right signal for the exit from the crisis. This is the first time that a plan of this kind will be funded by mutualised debt. This aspect should not be understated, as it is extremely significant. It shows that there is a willingness to reach an agreement. The markets reacted to the agreement with relief, although they had already priced it in to some extent.  Will the €750 billion be enough to deal with an economic downturn as sharp as the one brought about by the coronavirus (COVID-19)?  We must bear in mind that this fund comes on top of the plans that have been implemented by each Member State. Even though it’s important, it’s something additional. The European Commission’s own calculations show that the national stimulus packages alone are equal to 8% of European GDP.  The agreement involves clear conditionality. How is it going to affect the Member States that hope to access the grants?   I have never understood the debate about conditionality. There have always been conditions in European solidarity policies. Member States seeking this support will have to submit their investment plans to the European Commission, which will decide whether or not to give them the green light. There are two predefined priority areas: climate change and digitalisation of the economy. No single Member State will have veto powers, but the Commission – and ultimately the European Council – will have an oversight role to ensure that the money is earmarked for investments that boost competitiveness.  Will the agreement mean putting the brakes on the repeal of the Spanish labour market reforms that were introduced by Mariano Rajoy’s government?  It falls to the Commission, not the ECB, to pronounce on that issue. What I can say is this: the Commission took a very positive view of the 2012 labour market reforms, which helped to create almost half a million jobs each year over six consecutive years.  The COVID-19 crisis has tested EU institutions. Which of the ECB’s measures would you highlight?  The ECB acted decisively. And we did so in three ways. We provided banks with liquidity at favourable terms in order to prevent a credit crunch for businesses and households. We also launched an emergency asset purchase programme, of mainly public debt, which will continue until at least mid-2021 and which amounts to €1.35 trillion. Moreover, measures to improve capital and liquidity ratios in the banking sector were also encouraged. These policies have had a positive impact, especially if we look at developments in government bond yields and the spreads between countries. And this policy of decisive action has been supplemented by the policies that national governments have put in place both to provide liquidity and support the smooth flow of credit and, through furlough schemes, to prevent mass redundancies.  Will what has been done so far be enough?  We are experiencing an unprecedented situation. With the lockdown, there was a huge drop in activity over a period of two and a half months. The economy wasn’t prepared for the lockdown, but in our view it has not suffered any structural damage. A rebound will be possible, but our calculations show that it will take us two years to return to pre-COVID-19 levels of output.  Some countries, such as Spain and Italy, have suffered the consequences of the pandemic more than others, in terms of both public health and the economy, and it seems that they will face a more challenging recovery. Could this disparity create a two-speed Europe?  The pandemic is a common shock, but its impact has varied across countries. The variation stems from objective factors, such as the importance of tourism in the economy, the severity of the lockdown measures or a country’s ability to provide a fiscal response. This is why the plan approved on Tuesday is so important, as it seeks to redress these differences to ensure that no country is left behind. So, in this respect, the recovery fund reduces the risk of a two-speed Europe. Evidently the recovery will not be uniform, but the plan will reduce divergence between economies.  Is there a risk that the decline in activity will have an impact on the solvency of any of the larger banks?  In a few days’ time, the ECB will be publishing the outcome of its vulnerability analysis of banks, which is a substitute for the stress tests. The average capital ratio of European banks is around 15%. There is every indication that, with this high level of solvency, most European banks could withstand a 9% fall in GDP and survive the two years it will take to return to the level of output seen before the spread of COVID-19.  Do you think Europe will emerge stronger from this crisis?  Yes, I think so. The European project will emerge stronger because, as I said before, the Member States have shown that they are able to reach an agreement. There was a willingness to compromise, and this was demonstrated by all the Member States of the EU. That sends a very powerful message.  Some economists say that the 2008 crisis was solved using neoliberal strategies and that neo-Keynesian methods are being applied in the current crisis. Would you agree with this analysis?  The cause of the crisis is different. The 2008 crisis was a debt crisis, whereas now we are dealing with a public health crisis which has led to lockdown measures that have resulted in an unprecedented decline in economic activity. Therefore, the response has to be different. Ambitious monetary policy measures have been implemented in parallel to fiscal policies that have prioritised support to businesses and households. In return, the deficit has increased and public debt has grown. And that will be the legacy of this crisis: high levels of debt to GDP.  An expansionary monetary policy was required and that is what has been implemented. But, later on, when the economy recovers, it will be necessary to rebalance the deficit and start to reduce the debt. That is the only way to ensure that the welfare state is sustainable over the medium and long term.  Should banks pay dividends this year?  Banks need to be extremely prudent when distributing dividends. The measures taken by the ECB were aimed at preventing a credit crunch. And the recommendation to suspend dividend payments is also geared towards this. Bank profits should not be used to pay dividends, but to further support lending.   "

So, we're lucky to have you this morning, the day after the announcement of the EU's recovery package of €750 billion, roughly $850 billion. It's being described in the US and European press as unprecedented, revolutionary, a new path forward for the EU. I know this isn't directly your area because this is in the area of fiscal policy, not monetary, but perhaps you could just explain to our viewers why this is so important and what you think it may accomplish.  David, I think it is, it is important because for the first time, albeit on a temporary basis and to deal with the emergency situation, the 27 member states comprising the European Union have decided to jointly borrow in order to support those member states that were most affected by COVID-19. So, this is clearly a demonstration of solidarity, of transfer to those that need it most, and it's the first time that, you know, there is such joint borrowing of that magnitude.  So there have been commentators in the US this morning who have been describing this as a Hamiltonian moment, remembering Alexander Hamilton and his actions as our first Treasury secretary to assume the debts of the different states after the Revolutionary War and thereby pull the United States, the young country together. Do you think that that's an apt comparison to what's been done here by the EU in pulling the countries together and making this common commitment to borrow and then make grants?  You know, I don't think that history actually repeats itself, and comparisons are odious. But I think it's a breakthrough in that at a time of shock, where the economy is massively, brutally impacted, I mean, just think for a second. In a matter of two quarters the euro area will have lost as much output as it has gained over the last 15 years. So that gives you an idea of the violence of the economic shock. So, in response to that, in a determination and decisiveness, solidarity act, the member states have said, okay, let's borrow together. So it's not an assumption of the debts from the past, you know, each country keeps its own lot of debt from the past, but it's a determination to move forward together and to particularly help those that have been massively affected by COVID-19 and which did not have actually the fiscal space to respond as they should have.  Madam Lagarde, you said last weekend as this deal was being worked out that you hoped that it would be ambitious and not just fast. And I want to ask you whether what's been accomplished meets your test of being ambitious, stepping up to the enormity of the problems.  The total envelope that they've agreed is €750 billion, as you say, north of $850 billion, and that's just for the, what they call the recovery and resilience plan. In addition to that, they've also discussed a seven-years budget that is north of a trillion euros. What I think was important was the right allocation of how much was going to be grants, in other words, joint borrowing allocated, given if you will, to those member states that need it most, namely, you know, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, but also Poland and many countries actually will benefit from that portion, and how much was going to be loans that will have to be refunded by those countries that borrow. And I think the proportion is reasonable. It was hoped in the first place that it would be two-thirds grants, one-third loans. It ended up being a little under €400 billion of grants and 350 of loans. So, you still have more grants than loans. But it's, you know, it's a good balance. It could have been better, but it's a very it's a very ambitious project, actually.  So, let's turn to the question that your economists oversee at the European Central Bank, and that is where the European economy is going. And I'd be very interested in your colleagues' forecasts and your own sense of what we can expect, both for the final two quarters of this year and then going into 2021. The numbers that I've seen from the EU suggest a significant contraction this year on the order of 8.7 percent is the latest figure I saw, but then a recovery that's significant, 6.1 percent in 2021. Do those numbers seem right to you? And I'm curious about what bumps in the road you think there might be in terms of achieving the kind of recovery everybody wants.  You're right. The numbers you've mentioned are our baseline. A contraction of 8.7 this year and a clear pickup next year and the year after. It's the baseline. We have also worked on scenarios, as most economists have done. The mild scenario, which is a little better, which is in the range of -5 percent, and severe scenario, which is -12ish percent. We, for the moment, the numbers that we're getting for the second quarter would comfort us in the idea that our baseline is probably in the right place. But obviously those things can change, and forecasting is a difficult exercise, particularly at the moment when you are missing some of the usual tools to measure the economic progress and the creation of value. What could actually derail this baseline which seems to be in the right place now, would be a massive second wave, would be a re-confinement of significant scope, would be, you know, any catastrophic development that you can think of, of course, in geopolitical terms. But in economic terms, back here in Europe and in the euro area in particular the, what could aggravate the baseline is a major second wave. And by the way, because you're a man of numbers as well, those numbers that you've mentioned do incorporate a minimal element of second waves, you know, the flaring up that we see here and there in small clusters and against which instant action is taken by the various policymakers. So that's taken into account. If it was a second massive wave of the kind that we have faced back in early March, then it would be a different story.  So, I take it from what you just said that your economists, forecasters do not see ahead what we refer to as a W, that is to say, we're rising but then we're going to get hit with a second wave and a sharp additional downward trend? It sounds like your numbers don't bear that out.  No. No, they don't. They don't. And I'm not sure exactly what letter of our alphabet our forecast would correspond to. What I know, though, David, is that this recovery is uneven, is uncertain. And, you know, it's the first time that we're actually making a projection. We had operated on the basis of scenarios before that. So, it's going to be touch and go. But for the moment, given the numbers that we have given, the survey numbers, the very unconventional elements that we have, you know, some of the big data providers are now analysing traffic or use of cards, payment cards and instant payment to actually understand whether the economy is picking up or not, and to what extent people are back into the normal or quasi-normal consumption.   So, I think it's important for our viewers to understand that you as president of the ECB don't see that W, don't see us falling off a cliff again based on what you know now.   Based on what we know and, you know, barring any massive second wave, we certainly don't see this W that you're talking about, no.  Let me ask you, Madam Lagarde, Europe is farther along in the reopening path than the United States is. And I'm very curious what you think Europe is learning about this process of reopening, that is to say, what's sensible and what's risky as you survey the experience of European countries.  I think what we are, what we have seen is a very gradual de-confinement where precautions were still either mandatory or highly recommended. So to give you an example, despite the fact that people were allowed back in cafés and terraces, as is often the case in Europe to have a glass of beer or a café, people were still asked to wear their masks in any confined places where there was, that was open to the public. So, whenever you went to, still today, when you go to a shop, when you go to the hairdresser, when you go to a restaurant, social distance is the rule, mask is the principle, and that is learning number one. The exit out of strict lockdown was very gradual, very thoughtful, very patient. And it was not an easy exercise, neither for policymakers nor for the people themselves. But we observed a really strong discipline throughout, and a good understanding that, you know, you had to guard against the temptation all the time if you wanted to protect not only yourself but others. I think the second learning was that we were all in this together. And clearly taking measures in one part of the country or one part of Europe was not enough and that those measures had to be taken together. It was a bit laborious in the first place, and there was the odd, you know, decision here or there to go solo, but in the main I think we learned that by working together and by moving together it was much safer.  So, this question really is an extension of your answer to the last one. What have Europeans learned in this period about what good political leadership looks like? What's been helpful to Europe as it's made its path out of the initial lockdown?  I'm going to be, I'm going to be extremely biased, David, and I'm not going to be a central banker at this very moment, but I would say that for myself I've learned that women tend to do a better job. It's quite fascinating, actually. When you look at those countries that were led by women and the path that they took and the policies that they adopted and the communication style that was in play was quite stunning. So, this is my woman's bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias. I think what …  This, go ahead, please.  I think the other aspect of policy communication that worked, as I observed it here, was the very honest, transparent and sometimes almost scientific approach that some of the policymakers adopted. When I look at what Chancellor Merkel has done here in Germany for instance, she very, very transparently shared data, numbers, casualties, rate of contaminations, and so on and so forth. And it became very quickly sort of common, you know, lingua franca, common knowledge that people would understand those scientific elements that enabled them to appreciate why certain measures were necessary such as masks, such as being confined, such as keeping social distances. I think that's, you know, from what I have observed in a few of the European countries that I know best, that seems to have worked well.  And I wonder just to ask you to take your provocative and fascinating comment a moment ago a step further, why is it that women were such successful leaders? Chancellor Merkel, obviously, Ursula von der Leyen at the EU similarly, you as the ECB president, why is it that these women have had great success, and let's say honestly, relative to male leaders?   You know, I was also thinking of those other leaders around the world. You look at the leader in Taiwan, in Belgium, in New Zealand. Many of those leaders, prime ministers or presidents that have also communicated well and carried the water of bad news as well as the water of clear explanation and strong recommendations.   And in closing this out, I know you're not a politician, but I do want to ask you if you have thoughts for the United States as we're heading toward an election in November, not about which candidate but about what good leadership is.  You know, I don't want to comment on any particular country. But, you know, leading is about inspiring, is about being both responsible and accountable, is about caring as well. I think, you know, you asked me the question about what is special about those, some of those women. I think the caring dimension is something that they manage to express well, and that was considered by viewers and voters probably as authentic.   Let's talk a little bit about the technical side of your life at the ECB. You're responsible for monetary policy, and my impression is that you've taken a stance very similar to our Fed Chairman Jay Powell in saying that the ECB will do whatever it takes within the limits of its charter to assure financial markets that it will be a provider of liquidity, that it will stand behind the ability to continue orderly trading. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how you've tried to play your monetary hand and what differences, if any, there are between your approach and that of Chairman Powell, here.  Well, first of all I'd like to pay tribute to him, because we really had a very good working relationship. We cooperated. We compared notes. We talked to each other on a regular basis at the height of the crisis and subsequently. One of the key differences is that he has a Treasury Department not far, and they can be strong interconnection relationships between them, and there is clearly, there are links that cannot be established at this point in time between the European Central Bank and a euro fiscal authority that still doesn't exist at this point. So, I think that that's the key difference number one. Key difference number two is that the markets are very different. A lot of the financing here in Europe is handled through banks. So, some of my programmes here at the ECB were directed at the banks, and we made financing available at very, very attractive conditions through the national central banks that constitutes the whole euro system of which the ECB is the center. But we made those loans available to banks, because they are the ones that actually provide the financing to corporates, to enterprises, to SMEs, to households. In the United States you have very different markets where the bank intermediation doesn't matter as much because you have a much deeper and more vibrant capital market, which is the source of financing for, you know, most of the corporates. So that's another big difference that clearly has driven us to design programs differently. He had a whole list of specifically designed financing tools and instruments that were, that identified particular segments of the markets. We had a massive financing that we called the targeted long-term refinancing operations, which was really a massive financing tool for the banking sector throughout the euro area. I think that I've identified a few differences for you here.  Let me ask just one final blunt question about monetary policy. Some analysts worry about the underlying solvency of many European banks. Yes, there are liquidity problems which the ECB can address through its loans. But in terms of the fundamental capital structure, the resilience of those banks, it's harder for you to do. And I wonder if you'd be willing to comment on that problem, if you think it is a problem, and what the ECB with other sensible financial policymakers can do.  You know, I think the European banks are much more solid than they were at the time of the great financial crisis. Their equity is strong. Their capital ratios are high. They have buffers to guard against the potential shocks. I think what distinguishes them from some of their U.S. counterparts is the fact that their profitability is lower, and that is a factor of many different reasons that it would take too long to go into. But I wouldn't say that European banks are, have solvency issues, not at all. Not at all. I would say that what would be desirable and what we are certainly encouraging is more consolidation, because there are banking systems in some European countries that are too fragmented, where there are many small institutions, and where clearly consolidation would reinforce them. And if we can see cross-border consolidation as well, even better. So, we are trying to change the regulatory framework in such a way that it does not prevent, it doesn't hamper possible consolidations. So, we'll see.   Let me turn to the question that I know you've reflected on a great deal, and that's what the post-pandemic global economy will look like. And you've done something that's really very interesting and unusual in structuring at least some of your quantitative easing purchases of debt, of assets, towards companies and sectors that are sustainable in terms of their response to global warming, to climate change. So, in effect, you have a green bond portfolio that you're imagining putting together, as I read the news. Tell us a little bit about that. And then respond to the criticism that's made, which is that central banks aren't in the business of making decisions like that that favour one political or policy strategy as opposed to another. What do you tell critics when they say, ah, this green bond stuff is not what a central bank should do?  Yeah, and if everybody looks at those issues and says, oh, this is not really my mandate or this is not really for me to do, this is always for somebody else, I would caution against that for anybody who's tempted to go in that direction. Let me just step back for a second. Forty percent of green bonds around the world are issued in Euro. So that gives us an indication of how strong that percentage of the market is. We buy 20 percent of all available green bonds, we the ECB. But apart from that, most of our purchases are not directed at corporate bonds, which is where you can actually distinguish between the brown, the not so brown, the green the very green. But most of our purchases are directed at sovereign bonds. And in that particular category, you cannot distinguish between greenish or not so green. You buy sovereign bonds. And it is obviously for governments, for policymakers to decide how much they want to respect or comply with the Paris Agreement that they've signed, and I certainly hope that they do. What directionally I hope we achieve is moving in the direction of being more active on the green bond sector that will itself be expanding. And what I have said is that we need to explore each and every activity that we have to see how climate change and the risks associated with climate change would affect our policies. I for one believe that price stability, which is the mandate of the ECB, we don't have two mandates like Jay Powell does; Jay has price stability and full employment; we only have price stability. But I contend that price stability can be significantly affected by climate change, and that as a result of that, if we want to deliver on our mandate, we have to be not only mindful but also take action in order to prevent climate change from affecting that price stability that is our mandate. So, I think that the two are intrinsically related and bound and require that actually we take those matters seriously into account, even though we are central bankers.   We have less than five minutes left, I'm sorry to say. So, I'm going to ask you one more big question where I'd love to hear your thoughts. You've said that you think that this post-pandemic economy will lead to, you said, an acceleration of transformations in the global economy. Obviously, part of that involves what we just had been talking about, the sustainable green aspect of the economy. But there are many other changes that are ahead. And I'm wondering in particular whether you think that the kind of globalization that we experienced for the last several decades really is going to, is going to make a turn, that we'll be facing a more decoupled, more limited global economy, whether we'll have major disruptions of industries that just don't work as well in a post-pandemic world as they did before. What do you, what do you think when you think about these accelerating transformations? What are some of them?  One is, I agree with you, acceleration of transformations. Those things were already there. And I can think of green. I use that, you know, as it's a bit an oversimplification, but let's use that. An economy that is more green, that is more digital and that will value proximity more than it did before. Now on the latter part, will that entail industrial sunset in some countries and the rise of new supply chain that would be more partner-based and more into proximity than into cost-cutting by all means and irrespective of the stretch of the supply chain? It would seem like it. And you know, it's difficult to predict what will happen. But this shock has been so brutal and so harsh, and it's not over yet, that everybody is rethinking and reconsidering. Why would I fly to all corners of the world as often as I have rather than use some of those technological device in order to talk to people and share ideas and communicate? Why would I buy unnecessarily many things that are cheap when I can actually access something that is more in my proximity? Why don't I use more digital devices in order to enrich my culture? I mean, those are sort of obviously advanced economy preoccupations, and it's a whole different ballgame when you think about some of those developing countries and fragile countries around the world that also depend on some of those supply chains. So how this is going to pan out and how we will continue to be mindful of all communities around the world, whether vulnerable, fragile, or advanced, is something that will require cooperation amongst ourselves. So, I think that multilateralism is not dead. This is the old IMF managing director inside me that is speaking, and I salute my, all my colleagues there. But I believe that those sort of natural reframing of our economies are going to have to be mindful of what happens in other corners of the world to make sure that it is actually sustainable, because that's another learning of this COVID-19, is that we are all so-interrelated and so dependent on each other in the face of those global massive challenges that come to hit us and will come back to haunt us if we don't deal with them.  Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, you've given us a wonderful half-hour example of how women are leading in key aspects of our recovery from the global pandemic. We're grateful for your insight. We hope that you'll be able to get on a plane before too long and come see us here in Washington. We miss you, and we hope we can do this event face to face in the near future. But thank you so much, Madam Lagarde, for joining us this morning to discuss the path forward.    "
2020-07-21,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Expansión,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andrés Stumpf on 16 July and published on 21 July 2020","   INTERVIEW 21 July 2020  Interview with Expansión   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andrés Stumpf on 16 July and published on 21 July 2020  The last meeting didn’t lead to any new stimulus measures. Has the ECB already done enough?  Our decisions are guided by the incoming data, so we continuously monitor what is happening in the economy and financial markets. We calibrate our measures based on these data. Our latest macroeconomic projections were published in June, which was when we decided to expand our measures because we saw that the economic and, in particular, the inflation outlook had deteriorated substantially.  We’ve now seen some upside surprises but they are not sufficient to make us change course from our baseline scenario, which projects an 8.7% drop in real GDP in 2020. There was hence no reason to revise our decision from the previous meeting. In any case, we have certainly seen an improvement in the financial data, compared with the situation back in March. Markets have calmed down quite a bit. Nevertheless, financial conditions are still somewhat tighter than they were before the pandemic.  And are you comfortable with that situation?   Our measures take time to fully take effect. That does not happen overnight. Besides, monetary policy is not alone in providing support to the economy. Fiscal policy also plays a very important role, and we have seen a lot of action there as well.  The asset purchases have slowed down in the past few weeks. Does this have anything to do with the improvement that you mentioned?  Markets must be careful not to read too much into data that show short-term variations in the pace of our asset purchases. These purchases are determined by various factors, including seasonality. There is typically less activity in both the primary and secondary markets during summertime. That’s one reason why the monthly volume of purchases may drop.  There are doubts about whether or not the ECB will use the full envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which now stands at €1.35 trillion.  The PEPP envelope was calibrated to meet two objectives: to counter the risks to the medium-term inflation outlook due to the pandemic, and to prevent market fragmentation and ensure the transmission of our policy to the entire euro area. As long as we remain in the baseline scenario of our projections, it’s likely that the envelope will be used in full. Of course, upside or downside surprises are both possible in a situation with so much uncertainty. The balance of risks is currently still tilted to the downside in our view. It would be very good news if we were to see such an improvement in the outlook that we could use less of the envelope. That’s not the case for the time being, so the size of the current envelope remains appropriate.   If the situation were to worsen, does the ECB have any tools left? You always seem to have something else in your toolkit.  Let’s not forget that, not so long ago, many people were saying that the ECB had run out of ammunition. Our response to this crisis has clearly shown that we have a large and effective monetary policy toolbox at our disposal. We have, in fact, expanded our set of tools during this period, to be able to fulfil our mandate. And we can adjust our existing tools or create new tools in the future if necessary. I can assure you that we are in no way constrained in that sense.  By increasing the purchase volume again? The markets are already discussing the possibility of that.  Whenever we take a new measure, some market participants already predict that we are going to do more. It is important that markets properly understand our reaction function. We link our decisions to the developments that we see in the data. It is crucial to avoid a situation in which the markets end up dictating what decisions we take.  The current purchase programme has been calibrated on the basis of the data in the current macroeconomic environment. This won’t change just because investors are expecting more. What would have to change is the data.  In the current environment, when we’re already talking about trillions of euro in purchases, does an increase by hundreds of millions still have an impact?  We are seeing that this programme is very effective and it does make an important difference how much we buy in addition to the total purchases that have already been conducted.  There has also been a lot of talk about the possibility of you buying fallen angel debt (debt that has lost its investment grade rating), but you haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a controversial measure?  The truth is that, at least for the moment, we have not seen waves of rating downgrades for companies or countries that are on the brink of losing their investment grade ratings. So there is no urgency for us to discuss this now in relation to our asset purchases. But we are, of course, aware of the risk that credit rating downgrades could have procyclical effects, and this is something that we are monitoring very closely. And we are accepting this type of debt as part of the collateral that banks can provide when seeking central bank liquidity.  So it might be a possibility in the future?  I would not rule out this possibility completely, but it’s not on our agenda at the moment.  One concern about the programme is the capital key. How will the purchases converge towards the capital key? Could it be done through the reinvestments? We don’t know much about those…  Our only decision on this issue is what was published in the press release following the June Governing Council meeting. Maturing securities purchased under the PEPP will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022 and the decision to stop reinvestments will depend on the situation that we find ourselves in at that time. The end of the reinvestments should not interfere with our monetary policy stance. Our purchases of public debt securities under the PEPP are guided by the capital key and we are currently using the flexibility of the programme to deviate from it, if necessary. The question that we will have to answer in due course is how, and to what extent, we will later converge back towards the capital key. It seems clear that the reinvestment phase can play a role here, but we haven’t decided on this yet.  Moving away from the purchases, the liquidity injected into the banking system (targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTRO III) is another of the measures that you have taken. There has been a take-up of €1.3 trillion. Has the limit already been reached?  There is still capacity for some banks to ask for more liquidity. But there was clearly a huge incentive for banks to take part in the first big operation, which ensured the maximum benefit from the extremely attractive conditions. In my view, we have already seen the largest part of the take-up although we might still see some additional demand in the upcoming operations of this kind.  This liquidity is conditional on loans being granted, but quite a few people are concerned that the banks are using it to purchase sovereign debt. Are you monitoring this? Is it something you’re worried about?  The design of the programme is very clear. It provides incentives for banks to continue lending to the real economy, which is what makes this tool so attractive from our perspective. We know that banks can be reluctant to lend in times of crisis, which could reinforce the downturn, so the conditionality linked to this liquidity is very important. Having said that, the funds allotted through the TLTROs cannot be earmarked for a specific purpose.  But is the ECB at all interested in banks purchasing sovereign debt to relieve the pressure on your purchase programme?  That is not our objective. The aim is to ensure that credit continues to flow despite the crisis, and that banks are lending to the real economy. If you look at the potential returns that banks can generate from lending, it continues to be more attractive on average, even when adjusted for risk, to lend to non-financial companies than to purchase domestic public debt. Therefore, we believe that this is a sufficient incentive to lend, even if banks have already reached the minimum lending threshold required by the conditions of the programme. In any case, the volume of debt issuances of both sovereigns and firms has shot up, and we are aware that some of the new bonds will be purchased by banks. This can be a stabilising factor in times of crisis, but the previous crisis taught us that a strong interconnection between banks and domestic sovereigns can cause other types of problems. Therefore, such a situation should generally be avoided, and breaking this link was and is one of the main aims of the banking union. To achieve this, all the pillars of the banking union need to be completed.  Credit is currently flowing at record levels.  Our measures seem to have worked very well so far, and we have indeed seen a strong increase in lending volumes. This was absolutely crucial, especially in the first few months, because during the lockdown period many firms suffered a total collapse in their revenues, and the banks played a crucial role in allowing firms to draw down their credit lines to weather the storm. Banks are a key part of the solution to this crisis.   You have signalled that you do not want monetary policy to be conditioned by the markets. But is it not conditioned, in some fashion, because of the most indebted countries? Their debt levels are being described as unsustainable…  This is clearly exaggerated. Even at the height of the crisis no Member State was close to losing market access. There is a debate about fiscal dominance and some have raised doubts about whether we will ever be able to stop our purchases. In fact, we have shown in the past that we can stop our net asset purchases. When the time comes, we will reduce our asset purchases, depending on the inflation outlook. We have a clear legal framework that prevents us from conducting monetary financing, so every decision we take has to be linked to our mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term.   So if inflation were to shoot up next month, would the ECB be obliged to abandon its stimulus programmes?  We look at inflation over the medium term, so if there is a sudden increase in prices, but it is a one-off event, it will not affect our decision-making. It has to be something persistent. If that were to happen, we would carefully assess what the appropriate response is. The aim of all our decisions is to bring inflation closer to a level of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. However, we can adjust the speed at which this happens. And there we have to take the side effects of our measures into account, for example the effects on our secondary objectives that are also defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU or on financial stability. So even if inflation were to increase, we would not raise interest rates immediately if doing so would tip the economy into a recession. Over the medium term, such a rate hike could be even more damaging to price stability. So we have some flexibility.  I understand that the ECB is much less constrained by one-off increases in inflation than it was in the past. Is that the case? Because in the past we saw the ECB raise rates in such a situation…  This is not so much related to constraints; it is a policy decision. The Governing Council has to continuously discuss the pros and cons of its decisions, within the flexibility permitted by our mandate.  Public opinion of the ECB in Germany has improved a lot recently, hasn’t it?  In Germany and elsewhere in the euro area, people are acknowledging that the ECB has done a lot to avert a financial crisis, which is what we were facing in March. Our actions seem to have had a positive effect on how the ECB is perceived. I put a lot of effort into communicating better with the citizens of the euro area, especially those who view our measures critically, to try to explain why we do what we do and how it is helping all parts of the euro area.  On the other side of public opinion you have the ruling of the German Constitutional Court, which indicated that the ECB has exceeded its competences with its debt purchases. The conflict seems to have been resolved, but did it condition your actions?  The Federal Constitutional Court argued that we had not sufficiently demonstrated the proportionality of our measures. In reality, we are constantly doing just that. So one of the factors that appear to have led to this ruling was that we have not been sufficiently transparent about the reasoning behind the decisions we take. Therefore, it makes sense that we are talking more openly about all of this, so the public understands that we are always carefully considering the proportionality of our actions and that we take this very seriously. In that sense, the ruling of the Constitutional Court has been positive. In any case, it has not constrained our actions.  This crisis seems to have struck Spain especially hard. How do you see the situation there?  Spain is one of the countries that has been most affected by the pandemic and the crisis. Relative to the severity of the crisis, the fiscal response may prove to be insufficient. The fiscal space is more limited than in some other countries because debt levels were already high before the crisis, and it is important to avoid them becoming excessively high. Therefore, the European recovery fund is incredibly important, especially for Spain. This virus has already caused too much suffering, and Europe has to make sure that the economic consequences are cushioned as much as possible, also to avoid a divergence of economic developments in different parts of the euro area.  Spain was one of the euro area’s success stories before this crisis broke. There were many challenges, but the country managed to handle them well. I think it is important that Europe shows the same level of determination now to fight this crisis. The ECB is playing its part. The measures to ensure the flow of credit are particularly relevant for a country like Spain that has a large share of small and medium-sized enterprises.   How do you assess last European Council’s discussions?  It is good news that the European Council seems to be coming closer to a solution even if the initial proposal has been watered down somewhat. The proposed package is likely to include a substantial grant component, which is particularly important for those countries that have been hit hardest by the pandemic and that have more limited fiscal space, such as Spain. There are still many details to be determined but discussions appear to be moving broadly in the right direction. I hope Europe will show that, in spite of all the differences among Member States, it can stand together and provide a common solution.  What about Spain’s financial sector?  Spain’s financial sector has become much stronger after the restructuring efforts launched in 2012, and this has helped Spanish banks enter this crisis with fairly solid levels of capital. Therefore, they should be able to support the Spanish economy through this crisis.   "
2020-07-13,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with ARD “plusminus”,"Transcript of an interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, with ARD “plusminus”, conducted by Markus Gürne on 8 July 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 13 July 2020  Interview with ARD „plusminus“   Transcript of an interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, with ARD “plusminus”, conducted by Markus Gürne on 8 July 2020   For the first time, we welcome someone from the leadership of the European Central Bank to our studio: Professor Isabel Schnabel, who has been a Member of the ECB’s Executive Board since the start of this year. She is also a former Member of the German Council of Economic Experts and Professor of Financial Ecomonics. Good evening, Ms Schnabel.  Good evening, Mr Gürne.  Has your view of the ECB’s monetary policy changed since you took up your new position? You used to be critical yourself.  It seems to me that the general attitude towards the ECB has improved over the past few weeks and months. And that is probably because people are pleased that the ECB responded to this crisis in such a decisive manner, that we basically averted a serious financial crisis in March. So my impression right now is that the criticism has abated somewhat. But I assure you that we take this criticism very seriously. We bear a huge responsibility and reflect carefully on the measures that we take.   As we’ve just heard in the video, there are still quite a few critical voices, also in social media. How do you plan to win over the Germans, the Germans who are critical of the ECB?  I want to listen. And I want to explain. This is extremely important to me, and I have made it part of my mission. In recent years, central banks have frequently spoken with experts, and have communicated with them in a language that may not be understandable for the general public. I think we have a lot of work to do in that respect. We need to improve our communication and we have to do more explaining. And that’s what I want to do.   Germans have a deep-seated fear of inflation, of money losing its value. And perceived inflation is indeed much higher than the measured inflation rate. Ms Schnabel, an inflation rate of 0.3% is simply a bare fact. But as we’ve just heard, the perceived rate is much higher. How does that all fit together?   Yes, you are absolutely right. We know that perceived inflation often differs from the rate that we measure. And that’s because we measure inflation using a basket of goods. And that basket contains hundreds of items. But as regards perceived inflation, people look especially closely at the prices of items that they consume regularly, such as groceries. And these have indeed increased in price quite strongly over the past few months. But the prices for other items, such as durable consumer goods, have actually been falling. However, we don’t really notice this as much because we don’t buy them frequently.   That’s the famous basket of goods including the washing machine, which you don’t buy regularly as you only have one. The ECB has always communicated, in a mantra-like fasion, that inflation should be close to 2%. This benchmark is now looking increasingly shaky. Why is that?   I’m not sure that this benchmark is looking shaky. What I can say is that we will carefully review our monetary policy strategy. And we will of course ask ourselves if this inflation aim of 2% is still appropriate. But many of the reasons that resulted in the agreement on this aim of 2% are still valid. So it’s not at all certain that we will eventually diverge from this target.  “What can the ECB do to compensate me for the losses that I, as a small saver, have had to bear during this period?” I couldn’t put it better myself, so I will pass the question on to you.   I completely understand that people are concerned. They are concerned because it’s very difficult to build up savings when interest rates are low. But it’s important to bear in mind that we are not only savers. We are also borrowers, we are taxpayers and we are workers. And while savers have suffered from low interest rates, people who have maybe bought a house and taken out a loan have benefited. The public sector has also benefited hugely, because it has been able to borrow at such favourable rates. And, most of all, workers have benefited, because the ECB’s monetary policy has had a very positive impact on the labour market in recent years. In other words, many people now have a job which they might not have had otherwise.  But I’d like to briefly come back to the question, Ms Schnabel, of what savers should do to save differently?  Yes, even in an environment of low interest rates, people need to save money for retirement, of course. The question of what form that should take depends very much on individual needs, on risk preferences and so on. In any case, people should not just deposit their money in a savings account, they should also think about other forms of saving.  The coronavirus pandemic has put paid to any remaining hopes that we might see positive interest rates again in the coming years. At the same time, the ECB is providing vast sums of money for rescue packages to counter the pandemic. The sums involved are beyond comprehension. Who will pay it back? And when?   I’d like to make one thing very clear from the start: the ECB doesn’t put together rescue packages. Rescue packages are put together by politicians, using fiscal policy. The central bank safeguards price stability. In normal times, the central bank does this through its interest rate policy. And in times like these, when the level of interest rates is very low, it does so by buying bonds, in other words debt issued by governments and by companies. The aim is to improve financing conditions so that companies invest more, households consume more and the whole economic process consequently picks up momentum so that prices start to rise again.  And yet there is a link between politics and monetary policy. The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, in a noteworthy ruling, said that the ECB cannot carry on as before. It has limited your scope for action. How are you dealing with that?  In fact, the Federal Constitutional Court didn’t take issue with the programme itself. They criticised us for not having provided sufficient evidence of why these are the right instruments, why our actions are proportionate. And we have provided documentation to the German parliament and the German government, both of which are now satisfied that we do indeed always conduct an assessment, a very careful assessment, of the proportionality of our programmes. What we certainly do need to work on – and this brings us back to the start of our conversation – is our communication.  Thank you, Ms Schnabel, for talking to us today.  It was my pleasure.   "
2020-07-08,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Financial Times,"Video interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Roula Khalaf on 7 July 2020 and posted on 8 July 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 8 July 2020  Interview with Financial Times   Video interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Roula Khalaf on 7 July 2020 and posted on 8 July 2020   President Lagarde, thank you for this opportunity to speak with the FT. It's been quite a start for you, quite a ride. You were at the helm of the ECB for about four months, when the biggest crisis in the generation struck. What has it been like for you, and how do you think you've done?  It's been a very steep learning curve, no question about that. I think that together with members of the Executive Board and members of the Governing Council, we tried to respond as fast and as efficiently as we could in a situation that was deteriorating very brutally. I've been through quite a few crises. I'm not a veteran of all crises but I've been through the great financial crisis. I was very involved in the sovereign debt crisis but this one – COVID-19 – was very, very brutal. We had to respond extremely fast because we saw a quasi-seizure of the financial markets. We saw a dash for cash on the part of many of the key players. We had to use all the tools we had and harness as much cooperation among central bankers in order to respond to the crisis. I would say that it was a combination of using all the tools, harnessing as much cooperation internationally as we could, and making sure that the Eurosystem at large, meaning of course the ECB but also all the Governing Council members, was on board and using all those tools.  We'll come back to monetary policy. When you think of the recovery – and we're starting to see now a recovery – which letter of the alphabet do you favour? You've probably heard Andy Haldane just last week talking about a V-shaped recovery and that surprised many. Certainly you have been more restrained. Are you changing your mind at all?  I don't believe in this alphabet soup that we are hearing about. I think this recovery is like no other. It's going to be constrained, it's going to be uncertain and I think it's going to be fragmented across the world because clearly, the pandemic has hit in a sequential way. It wasn't a symmetric shock and the recovery is also going to be sequential. So we are seeing countries like China, like Korea, like Japan, like Australia coming out earlier than we are seeing European countries at the moment. We are seeing the Americas at large, including the US but also Latin American countries, at a later stage of this recovery process. So fragmented, certainly, and constrained by the uncertainty that we have around in terms of which sectors will be affected most, what impact policies will have, what overall response will be produced and what kind of cooperation will we see between the countries of the world.  Europe, so far, has avoided the massive job losses that we have seen in the US. Do you think that that's sustainable?  I think that the reason many of the European countries are still showing reasonably good job numbers and unemployment numbers that have not worsened dramatically had to do with the furlough system and the unemployment benefits that were available. That actually kept employees employed and employers supported by guarantee schemes, by furlough schemes, which were not available in the same scope and broad reach in the US. What will matter is what comes next. Are we going to have coordination between the phasing out of unemployment benefits and furlough schemes and a pick-up of activity? Or are we going to face a gap in between which would then see unemployment numbers rise significantly? That's really one of the big issues.  What about in terms of inequality? We are seeing – and in fact we wrote a long piece today about essential workers and the fact that they are some of the lowest paid, have to take the most risk, and yet society and the economy have not really valued that work. Do you think that has to change?  That has to be the focus of policymakers. What you learn from history is that in all these major crises, whether they are natural disasters, whether they are pandemics, generally the most vulnerable, the poorest, the women and the young people are the ones that are most affected and that are the clear first victims of those situations. There is plenty of literature about this particular topic, and policymakers have to really focus on that category.  Let me just press you a little bit on that. What should policymakers then do?  Well, I think they have to use the tools available and that includes fiscal, of course. That includes moral suasion in the private sector. That includes reassessing the values that a society respects. I would hope that the lessons from the last three months will be remembered. I don't know if it was the case in the UK, but in many countries on the continent, at 8:00 pm everybody would go out on balconies and terraces and gardens to applaud the people from the hospitals and the clinics. Well, it's not just a question of applauding them; it's also a question of acknowledging the huge value that they deliver to society, and making sure that there is consideration for that in terms of renewed social contract, if that's what you were referring to.  Does it worry you that there has been a drift towards more protectionism and at the same time, that there are rising tensions between the US and China? That is likely to damage the global economy even more just as we're trying, just as countries are trying to recover.  Those trends that you're referring to will obviously have an impact on economic development, will have an impact on growth, will have an impact on trade between countries. What we have seen historically in the last 30 years is that what was called globalisation has had a lot of benefits for many. The reason why so many people were taken out of poverty, out of starvation, had to go with globalisation. Now, that's the rosy side of globalisation. Clearly, what we have also seen on the occasion of COVID-19 and the pandemic is that supply chains were probably stretched too much and to the point where basic supplies were just no longer available. It has also demonstrated that while mobility is of course good, proximity was seen as also very valuable and necessary for the economic development of communities. It may well be that this particular crisis will transform our perception of globalisation, proximity, short supply chain, control over one's destiny. To me, what will really matter is how we can make those concepts that are close to people's desire and hearts compatible with enough global development and multilateral relationships, so that benefits can also fall out to other countries and not just be restricted to your own shores.  So you're hoping that it won't be a permanent setback for globalisation?  I think the whole set of relationships and business models of countries will have to be revisited. Countries cannot be exclusively driven and supported by trade and trade only, for instance. Equally, you cannot just close your borders and assume that you're going to operate in your own restricted circle because problems are of a global nature, because pandemic ignores borders, because capital flies across the world.  Just one small question on Brexit: do you think that it will aggravate the impact of the pandemic on European economies because of the timing of Brexit at the end of the year, whether it's with a deal or without a deal?  If you combine two downside risks, two uncertain outcomes, you clearly have a multiplier impact so how one will reinforce the other, I don't know. They are heading in the same direction, which is not an easy one.  Let's talk about monetary policy. It's interesting that when you took over, the view amongst economists was that the ECB had breached the limits of monetary policy, and that the best you could do is to cajole, convince governments to embrace fiscal stimulus. Instead, now you say that there is no limit. This is the new motto: there is no limit to what the ECB is willing to do.  Our support for the euro is unlimited, yes. But that's because we have a mandate which is price stability, and which dictates that we pay very close attention to both monetary stance, to monetary transmission, that we are attentive that financing is not tightened to the point where economic actors cannot develop activity. I think that's exactly what we have applied at the time when the crisis started unfolding. We had to look at what was available and we had to invent new instruments in order to respond to the crisis and make sure that we could actually deliver on our mandate.  Is there a hard limit to the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme? If there isn't one, then what happens next?  I would observe that through the impact of the massive programmes that we put in place, the situation has calmed down enormously. The tightening that we had seen loosened. I'll give you an example. Together with a few other key central banks around the world, we had those US dollar swap lines that were in very high demand at the beginning of the crisis. Now, none of it is needed. That's an example. So I believe that the measures we have taken have actually demonstrated the efficiency, the effectiveness, and were just right in responding to the situation. We are going to be very attentive to the economic developments, to the many numbers that are popping up, whether it's PMI, whether it's services, whether it's employment, whether it's inflation and the like of it, to make sure that our tools are properly calibrated and can respond adequately to the current situation. We have a very – how would I put it? We receive myriads of numbers at the moment, but it's very uncertain. It's going to take a while before we have a solid response from the economic terrain, if you will, to really assess the effectiveness of what we do, as well as the prospects of what will happen. But we have done so much that we have quite a bit of time to assess that carefully.  Why did you say at the very beginning of the crisis that the ECB's role wasn't to manage spreads between Italian and German bonds?  Well, first of all, I think that was pre-pandemic. That was pre-major programmes that we've put in place in order to make sure that there was plenty of liquidity, that the transmission channels were not impaired, which is part of our duties – and an important one – and before we made sure that banks were in a position to lend to the economy, both at the top corporate levels as well as the entrepreneur level. I think that that is the best response that we could give at the time.  Well, Germany's Finance Ministry said last week that the ECB had fulfilled the requirements of the Constitutional Court. It does look like that particular case is on its way to being resolved. Even if it is, though, does it not set a dangerous precedent and undermine the independence of the ECB? How do you look at it?  I'm a lawyer by background so I look at the legal ground on which we stand. The first thing I see is the independence of the European Central Bank, number one – which doesn't mean to say that it's unaccountable. The ECB is accountable to the European Parliament. The European Central Bank has a court which has jurisdiction over it, which is the European Court of Justice. To me, that's critically important. The Treaty has to be respected. It was put together – and with great interest on the part of Germany, by the way – that a central bank has to be independent. I think we need to stand by those principles, which I think we have in the case of the most recent decision that was rendered in Germany. The German authorities found the right level of response. As part of the good relationship that we have with all our members, we supported the Bundesbank to make sure that the principles of proportionality were properly evidenced and demonstrated, as it has been applied ever since we went into monetary policy, for that matter.  You didn't look at it as a dangerous precedent?  Not at all, because as I said, the Treaties speak for the legal ground on which we stand: accountability to European Parliament, European law as the applicable law, and the European Court of Justice as the court which has jurisdiction over us. So that's our story.  Let's talk about negative rates: why do you think that they're beneficial, when the Fed and the Bank of England have steered clear of them?  We look at it very carefully and whenever we decide a monetary policy stance, whenever we decide to use a particular tool, we always look at how effective it is, how efficient it is and how proportional it is. Those are the three yardsticks against which we measure such or such other tool. Clearly, we look backwards to make sure that the test of time is actually demonstrating that it is, that it was, the right tool to use. Our experience with negative rates is actually positive overall. Now, it's clear that if you are granular to the point where you only look at one category of transactions or one category of citizens, you might reach a different conclusion. But we have to look at the overall euro area. We have to look at overall categories of economic players. We have to look at the overall circumstances under which we operate. We have to look at the impact that such measures will have. So at this point in time, clearly, and given the circumstances that prevailed at the time, it was the right decision to go for these negative rates.  The main criticism is that it's corrosive, especially on banks and insurance, and that it fuels bubbles in property, for example. What do you say to the critics?  I say exactly what I say to you very openly; it's that we have to look at all aspects, all consequences and all effects of a particular monetary policy. You cannot only look at the category of the savers; you also have to look at the borrowers. You have to look at the level of desired investment. You have to look at the volume of savings. You have to take all these factors into account to determine whether, on balance, the tool that has been selected as a policy going forward is actually delivering effective, efficient and proportional outcome. This certainly has been the case.  There's another concern that I hear often, and that is that the ECB's financing of governments by buying so much sovereign debt, to the point where it may have to just perpetuate because governments won't be able to stand on their own feet. Is that a valid concern?  It's clear that there are many, many other investors and purchasers out there to buy sovereign debts at the moment. We are seeing it on a regular basis; whether it's issuance of green bonds by some member states or whether it's issuance of very, very long-term maturity bonds by others or whether it's large issuance, there is a serious appetite on the part of investors. I think that the European Central Bank is not the only game in town when it comes to buying those bonds. There is a market out there. It's a vibrant one and the policies that we have in place are showing the efficiency.  Some economists are asking whether the ECB will ever hit its inflation targets.  Well, clearly the price stability that is inscribed in the Treaty is dictating and driving our action because it is our single mandate. It was defined back in 2003 as close to but below 2%. If you look at a longer period of time than the last few years, clearly that goal was reached. It's only recently that it has been lower than what the average was over the last 20 years or so. Clearly, we have the aim of targeting the price stability which is our mandate. We will continue to deploy the tools that we have in order to do so. One caveat, though, is the fact that we will be resuming finally our strategy review. Clearly, inflation, inflation components, measurements, price stability definition will be under review. But I have no doubt that we will be driven by our price stability mandate on a going-forward basis.  I want to ask you about the review in a minute, but just to stay on inflation: there is a debate right now about whether we're going into an inflationary environment or towards deflation. What do you think?  That's a really difficult question because we are seeing disinflationary forces at the moment. I think there are many economists who argue that there is more of that and potential deflationary risk. But I'd rather talk about disinflationary forces in the short term, and then total uncertainty as to the medium-to-longer term. When we look at our medium-term projection, we are pretty close to numbers that we had pre-COVID, to give you an example. Now, how these economic forces, how this economic transition, how the digitisation of the economy, how the greening of our economies will impact prices and the measurement of inflation is going to be a major determinant of what inflation will look like going forward. But it may well be inflationary in the longer term. It's part of the uncertainty that abounds at the moment.  As you say, a very difficult question. Turning to fiscal policy, how important is it for the ECB that EU governments agree on the €750 billion recovery fund?  I think it's important for all Europeans, and it's important because it will demonstrate clearly a sense of common destiny, a sense of solidarity that needs to be demonstrated in times of crisis. The fact that a recovery plan is large, fast, and focused on those areas that need improvement and those countries that suffered the most, will demonstrate that there is a European Union, and that there is unity of purpose in order to continue to build and develop this market.  I think a lot of Europeans in the first days of the crisis started to doubt that, because there was no solidarity, so I see your point. Do you think it can enforce solid recovery?  It will. I think it's a game-changer, let's face it. Because what we have seen during the crisis is a strong fiscal response at the national level, a very rapid and strong and convincing monetary response, a little bit of European response thanks to the ESM new programme, thanks to the SURE unemployment support, thanks to the EIB additional guarantees for companies. That was good, but the real game-changer element is the recovery fund; in particular if a good chunk of it is in the form of grants rather than loans, because it will, in that case, establish a degree of unity and solidarity to benefit those that have suffered most.  We should know possibly in a week or almost two weeks…  I know that there is a lot of hype and everybody would like to see, on July 17th at 6:30 and three minutes, the outcome of conclusive discussions. For those of us who've been around Brussels a bit, it takes a few days, it takes a few nights. I wouldn't be surprised that it comes later in July, so I wouldn't put all my bets on July the 18th.  But are you concerned about the divergence?  It's always a risk that going into the crisis, there was a degree of divergence, and that coming out of the crisis, that divergence persists and is possibly worsened. I think the whole purpose of the recovery plan is to try to re-establish a level playing field and to compensate those that have been worst hit by the pandemic.  An uneven recovery would presumably put more pressure on the ECB because some would want you to be tapering, others will not.  We will deal with that in due course. There's the Governing Council, there is an Executive Board and we try to work as cooperatively as we can, in good intelligence.  Let's turn to the strategic review because one of your objectives then –it was put on hold but has just been restarted – was to include combatting climate change. How do you see the role of a central bank when it comes to climate change?  I think when it comes to climate change, it's everybody's responsibility. Where I stand, where I sit here as head of the European Central Bank, I want to explore every avenue available in order to combat climate change. This is something that I hold very strongly and I believe that, as we have this price stability mandate that I described for you early on, climate change actually has an impact on price stability. If we fail to measure externalities, if we fail to anticipate drought, if we fail to anticipate variations of prices of food, of energy, of services, then we are not doing our job. So I think that even without changing our mandate, climate change has an impact. I'll tell you, it has an impact on how we model the economy going forward, how we forecast, how we measure risk, how we stress test institutions, how we value the collaterals that we receive, how we link and join forces with other national central banks to explore together what policies can actually have a decisive impact on fighting climate change. This clearly will be part of our strategy but I wouldn't want you to think that we're suddenly discovering it.  The ECB has addressed the issues of climate change. I think the impetus and the momentum is just stronger now and has to be multifaceted and has to look at all the business lines and the operations in which we are engaged in order to tackle climate change, because at the end of the day, money talks.  There have been some signs that the fight against climate change may be sacrificed as a goal as companies and governments deal with the impact of the pandemic. Do you worry about that at all?  I think those who would be tempted by that option would live to regret it. I have children, I have grandchildren. I just don't want to face those beautiful eyes, asking me and others, “What have you done? Why didn't you fight for my future? Have you protected biodiversity?” and so on and so forth. I think it's an imperative that generations will impose on us if we tend to forget it. It's a concept that markets will also force on us if we tend to forget.  Let me ask you about diversity. The Fed has spoken out again on racial diversity and how the pandemic has disproportionately impacted black and ethnic minorities. Has the ECB made any statements, and is that something that you're concerned about? The issue is that in Europe, in a lot of countries, we don't even have data so it's quite impossible to know. But in the UK, there is no doubt that we've seen a similar impact on black and ethnic minorities.  As you just said, we do not have much by way of data simply because data are not accepted. It's illegal to actually trace by way of colour, religion and so on and so forth in many countries in the euro area. So we don't have much by way of data, but suffice to look at the diversity that we have, clearly there is progress to be made. We have to continue delivering on the targets that are set for gender purposes. But we have to look beyond gender diversity; we have to look at all diversities.  You're one of three women who are defining the future of Europe at this time. With all due respect for the very powerful men, but you, the Commission President, the German Chancellor, how closely do you coordinate? I know that you know Angela Merkel very well, but how well do you know Ursula von der Leyen?  We know each other quite well and as you said, I've known the Chancellor for quite a few years. We are both veterans of Europe in some way and have attended many meetings together. We're often the only two women in big rooms full of men, and that certainly from my perspective – I don't want to speak for her – but from my perspective it does produce this complicity and friendship that is often generated by minority members. I go back with Ursula for quite a few years as well because we were sitting on the same groups or board meetings in various institutions. So we know each other well and we do communicate with each other on a regular basis.  Well, thank you very much for taking the time for this discussion.    "
2020-07-07,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with NRC Handelsblad,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Mark Beunderman on 1 July 2020","   INTERVIEW 7 July 2020  Interview with NRC Handelsblad   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Mark Beunderman on 1 July 2020  Are you satisfied with the solution that has now been found in the issue surrounding the ruling by the German Federal Constitutional Court?   Yes, we find this solution satisfactory, particularly as the ECB’s independence has not been impaired. We took a constructive attitude. We do not fall under the jurisdiction of the German Federal Constitutional Court, but we didn’t want to let the situation escalate.  You say that the independence of the ECB has not been impaired. But the accounts of the meeting of 4 June contain a lengthy discussion about the proportionality of the asset purchases. Was this not a reaction to the ruling of the German Federal Constitutional Court?   We have always held discussions about the effectiveness and side effects of our measures. In view of the German court ruling, it was quite natural that a particularly intensive and detailed debate took place at that meeting.   Has the tension between Germany and the ECB now subsided? The atmosphere was still rather toxic less than a year ago. Former ECB President Mario Draghi was labelled “Draghila” in the German press.   The euro enjoys a high level of trust in Germany, and even trust in the ECB is above the euro area average. And since the previous crisis, the general attitude towards the ECB in Germany, as I perceive it, has improved. Many acknowledge and appreciate what the ECB is doing in the current crisis. This may also be reflected in the way in which the German Federal Government and Parliament have dealt with the ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court.   Do you see it as your personal mission to improve the relationship between German public opinion and the ECB?   The communication between the ECB and the general public is very important, as has been stressed by President Lagarde. We need to do much more to reach out to people. I have made this part of my mission. But this goes beyond Germany. I am not “the German” within the ECB Executive Board. As far as I can see, many Dutch citizens also have a fairly critical attitude towards the ECB’s policy. I want to address them as well and explain better what we do.   That’s true. Many people in the Netherlands don’t understand what the ECB does. One of the sore points is that the endless period of persistently low interest rates is hitting the pension funds. The funding ratios are dire, pension cuts are looming.   We have to take this concern very seriously. The low interest rates have a strong impact on pension funds as well as on savings. But it’s a misperception to think that the central bank can determine interest rates on its own. Interest rates are mostly driven by long-term economic and societal trends, such as demographic ageing and low productivity growth. That’s why one sees low interest rates not only in Europe, but also in the United States and Japan.  That will probably remain so for some time and all financial actors have to learn to live with it. The Dutch pension sector is already adjusting its policies, by shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes and by changing the structure of investment portfolios.   But the central bank still has room for discretion? It can decide on reducing interest rates to a greater or lesser degree; there are always discussions on that within the Governing Council.   Yes, but one should not forget that our monetary policy also has beneficial effects for pension funds. Our measures have benefited the overall economy and strengthened corporate balance sheets. That boosts the contributions paid into pension funds.   The ECB projections in June were very bleak: in the baseline scenario the ECB foresees an economic contraction of 8.7% in the euro area this year. Can we expect the projections to become even bleaker?   In recent weeks some confidence indicators have come in positive, which suggests that the recession could turn out somewhat milder than expected. But overall we are in the range of our baseline scenario. What is more important is what happens in the medium term. How strong and fast will the recovery be? That depends to a great extent on the policy reaction. A strong European recovery fund is absolutely crucial for Europe as a whole.  The Netherlands wants the recovery fund to be smaller than the €750 billion proposed by the Commission. And it wants only loans, not grants.   The Dutch government may want to reconsider its position – not only out of solidarity, but also out of self-interest. It is very unlikely that the Dutch economy is going to thrive if large parts of Europe are still struggling. If most of the fund is made up of loans, this could create a public debt overhang after the crisis. That could then cause problems of its own.  Do you think there’s a risk that countries like Italy and Spain, as well as being hit harder by the pandemic, will also recover more slowly?   Exactly. There may be further divergence among countries in the euro area.  In March, before the ECB launched its pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the bond spreads skyrocketed. Were there fears inside the ECB of a new debt crisis in the euro area?   I wouldn’t go that far. The spreads were far away from the levels seen in the euro crisis that had its peak in 2011-12. But we have learned from previous experience that one has to act early if there’s a risk of a self-reinforcing downward spiral.  So the ECB had to bring down the borrowing costs of Italy and Spain?   The first objective of the PEPP is to counter the risks to the inflation outlook over the medium term, which is being dampened by the crisis. The second objective is to counter the risk of fragmentation within the euro area. In times of crisis you can have a fast-moving, negative dynamic: capital flows out of fragile countries towards “safe havens” like Germany. Then borrowing costs in a country like Italy may rise quickly, not just for the government but also for households and businesses. That would create a problem for the ECB, because we have to make sure that our single monetary policy reaches the whole euro area. By the way, it’s not that we say: Italian or Spanish spreads must not rise above a certain level. The yields on government debt differ among euro area countries, because economic fundamentals are different in each country. We don’t want to change that. But if suddenly, somewhere in the euro area, funding conditions worsen dramatically, then we have to counter this.  Does that make the ECB a unusual central bank? All the major central banks are now intervening on a massive scale in order to tackle the crisis, but you also have to keep the euro together.   Of course – we are in a special situation. The euro area is a union of largely sovereign states with a common monetary policy. This means that we have to act in a slightly different way from other central banks.   "
2020-07-01,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Reuters news agency,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi, Francesco Canepa and Frank Siebelt","   INTERVIEW 1 July 2020  Interview with Reuters news agency   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi, Francesco Canepa and Frank Siebelt  We appear to be seeing two opposing trends in macro fundaments. Economic indicators, like the PMI, the Ifo or inflation, are coming in above expectations. But we are also seeing a sharp increase in infections around the globe. How do you square these trends?  We have a medium-term perspective, so what we focus on is different from what a stock market analyst might focus on. We have a projection horizon of around two years to 2022 and since monetary policy works with a lag, we are more focused on what happens a year from now, 18 months from now, 24 months from now, than on day-to-day fluctuations.  It’s possible for all of these developments to be occurring simultaneously, because we are in a multi-phase process. The second quarter is definitely the lowest point, but already in this quarter we had a significant first step in the recovery process. So, we are in the second stage of recovery and the big question is how much this initial bounce tells you about the speed at which we get back to the pre-crisis level.  We’ve done a lot. We have essentially this one-year horizon. We’ve put in place the PEPP for another year. The market has stabilised quite a bit compared to March but remains above the pre-crisis levels. We think it’s going to take a lot of time and that one-year horizon reflects that before we really know how able the European economy will be to recover from this shock. These weeks of the initial bounce don’t really provide a guide to what’s going to happen in the winter. We’re in for a long period where the data should be mostly positive, because the projection is that we’re going to grow compared to the bottom in April. Whether it grows at the same speed or we get an initial bounce and then it levels off it’s not going to be so easy for us, you or the market to navigate or extract useful signals from the data. There’s going to be a lot of noisy data and we really have to settle in and recognise that there isn’t going to be full clarity about the medium term for many months. There’s an additional question: when we get back to the pre-crisis level, which we think is around the end of 2022: are there long-term scarring effects? The fact that there’s a good bounce right now is good, but it doesn’t tell you that much about the overall recovery profile. And that goes back to the point you made about infections, which is this kind of “two steps forward, one step back” profile, where it looks like you can make progress but then there can be a localised problem. That’s what we have in our scenarios. We have partial interruptions this year and next year. We think that the European economy and probably parts of the global economy will have partial interruptions, either precautionary or in response to mini outbreaks. That’s why we think it’s going to take a long time for output to fully recover. It’s not just about the initial unlocking of the economy, it’s about that persistent interruption of normal economic life, and connected with that is the contribution of regulatory measures, such as lockdowns and the associated nervousness of households and firms. When you get reports of infections or reversals, prospects for consumer confidence and investor confidence to fully recover quickly are diminished.   Given a better-than-expected June inflation reading, are you now more optimistic that the risk of negative inflation has been eliminated?   Even in our severe scenario, we didn’t really have inflation going negative. All of this is in the context of a very large fiscal and monetary policy response. The risk of negative inflation is there but, in our scenarios inflation will remain quite low, while remaining in positive territory. It’s good news that the inflation numbers coming out are better than expected. But going back to my first point: it’s good, but it doesn’t tell you all that much about inflation in the medium term.   You have undershot your inflation target for seven years and it won’t rise back to target within your projection horizon. At what point do you say that what we’re seeing is no longer a shock but the new normal?   Do we have evidence that monetary policy affects inflation? The answer is yes. Our policies over the last several years have had a significant effect on the inflation rate. In the absence of the measures taken by the ECB, especially since 2014, we would be in a situation of much lower inflation, maybe even negative inflation. Remember: Japan spent about 15 years with negative inflation. It’s a two-level challenge. First, stabilising inflation at around 1% should not be discounted as a minor achievement. But, second, it’s quite important to continue to push inflation closer to 2% - and the pandemic illustrates why this is important. The European economy would be a lot safer, and our ability to deal with this type of shock would be much more enhanced, if we had an inflation rate closer to 2%. This would mean that the policy interest rate under a full recovery would be a lot higher, and we would have more room to respond to a negative shock with cuts in the interest rate.  The ECB has consistently said that this process of returning inflation to levels that are closer to 2% takes patience because we can’t make dramatic monetary policy moves. Interest rates are already pretty low and while we have effective extra tools like asset purchases, we can’t do the standard central bank routine of 20 years ago of reducing interest rates by 500 basis points in a recession.   But at what price can you do this? German Constitutional Court judges may be no economists, but they raise some concerns that are close to people’s hearts. House prices have risen sharply and this is partly because of ultra-low rates and excess liquidity. Certain capital-guaranteed saving products are no longer viable because of how bond yield behave under your policy. So, what’s the cost of what you just described?  A lot of what you just said is true because of the low equilibrium real interest rate, the so-called r*. And there’s no way getting around that. So the low interest rates are not just an arbitrary decision of the ECB. If the European economy has a low desire for investment compared to a high desire for savings, then the European economy can only have something reasonably approximating full employment and a path of inflation back to levels closer to our inflation aim if the rate the ECB sets is below the equilibrium rate. It is important to keep in mind that in the last decade, since the last financial crisis, governments were trying to greatly reduce their deficits or run surpluses. So, we had a significant fiscal contribution to total savings. But now, with the pandemic, a lot of that firepower has been put into action. Large fiscal deficits would be one way to address the aggregate savings issue.  Right now we have a big surge in household savings and the precautionary motive for household savings will be a big question. On the investment side, part of the way austerity worked was through a big reduction in public investment. That may be going in reverse now. So, most of what you said about how the financial system operates, reasonable expectation of savers, those hoping to buy a house, I really think the role of monetary policy in all that is minor. If, instead, we were to raise the interest rate when it’s not warranted, it would lead to a lower inflation rate and we would see an even longer period of very low interest rates.  We heard already back in 2016 that you need lower rates now to have higher rates later. But when does the future becomes the present?  If you go back, 2017 was a good year for the European economy and we started pulling back on the asset purchases. But then we had new shocks. Maybe the deeper question here is: why is the world economy and the European economy going through what turns out to be a sequence of negative shocks, with only temporary periods of good news in between?  My view is that some of those negative shocks cannot be sustained, some of them have the seeds of their own demise. So, I don’t see the world as always having these negative shocks and this is why central banks have the ability to reverse course. We have to be proactive in both directions. We have to be proactive in the direction of easing this year, because it is a large negative shock. But over the course of the last five years, since I have been on the Governing Council, we have also pulled back, we did shrink the asset purchase programme, and we did bring asset purchases to zero when we thought we could.  Some doubt this and argue that central banks are monetising debt. The best way to prove they are wrong is to have an exit strategy. What’s your exit strategy?   We have multiple exit strategies. We said what the exit strategy is from the APP and from negative interest rates, which is inflation robustly converging to our inflation aim. And then we have a sequence of lifting the policy rate and then starting to shrink the APP asset portfolio. On the PEPP, we will end the purchases when we conclude that pandemic crisis phase is behind us. We have also given guidance on reinvestments. Our forward guidance is full of exit strategies.  But what if you can’t exit? Are public debt levels a constraint? As soon as you start talking about an exit, yields rise. Last time you went only 9 months without buying bonds, which is not much.   The question you are posing in essence says that the European economy cannot grow sufficiently quickly and inflationary pressures are not going to be that strong so long as debt is at a certain level. This is not an unconditional truth. This idea that debt levels trap us, I just don’t see it. But what is true is the only real way to prove this is through action. I am confident that when we have the conditions which we laid out in our forward guidance, when those conditions apply, then we can move and exit.  You’ve pointed out that shadow banks contributed significantly to market stress in March and April. So why not open your balance sheet to some of them, at least investment funds and insurance companies?   We did list the role of non-banks in the transmission mechanism as a topic for the strategy review.   For now, it’s true that we don’t provide them with direct access to our balance sheet. But the fact is that banks have a lot of access to liquidity from us. Banks have a special role in the economy in terms of intermediation, and there is strong supervision of them. We ended up with a pretty generous asset purchase programme, which is not just the sovereigns but also corporate bonds and commercial papers. In addition, we made the targeted lending programme even more attractive. The combination of liquidity to banks, which can make loans if needed or have other transactions with these other intermediaries, and the asset purchases turned out to provide a lot of stability.   Corporate downgrades have been few, perhaps because of the fiscal response, including public guarantees. Do you think that downgrades have been avoided or is there still a wave coming?   Rating agencies are forward looking and they are probably in a wait-and-see mode. The initial period of instability was addressed quickly, so the feared illiquidity spiral has not happened. What remains an open question is how much earnings will be lost by corporations. In some areas, like airlines, there was a pretty immediate hit. But to me, current ratings look like a reasonable balance, which is that it is too early to tell. Under the baseline of a significant recovery in these weeks and months, the case for lots of downgrades is a lot less than if you ended up in the severe scenario where there is a second wave of rating downgrades. I think there is a very wide range of possible outcomes but as of right now, it’s not obvious to me, the data are not compelling to say that there should be a lot more downgrades.  Does that mean that there’s no urgency in discussing buying sub-investment grade corporate debt?  I think our approach is contingent on the data we see. Compared to where we were in mid-March, the scale of the improvement in market stability has already delivered quite a lot. We have a very liquid banking system, we are supporting a lot of credit, we have scaled up our activities in commercial paper and corporate bonds.   In March, the ECB initially decided to only increase bond buys by 120 billion euros and you were still talking about a “temporary shock”. But six days later you unveiled PEPP and a much more aggressive stimulus package. Markets sold off sharply during that period but strictly from a pandemic point of view, the situation had already been clear beforehand. Granted that hindsight is always 20/20 and no-one has a crystal ball, what would you do differently and what have you learnt from that experience?  Let me just make one basic point about monetary policy, which is very important, as demonstrated not just by us but by the Fed and everyone else who had unscheduled extra meetings. Any decision we take is always in the context of “if more is needed, more can be done”. Conditional on what we knew on 12 March, the move we made on that day is reasonable. There is always a risk that it wasn’t going to be enough. But we do have the ability to hold meetings out of the normal calendar, if it turns out that we need to adjust. Unlike fiscal policy, which has a much more difficult decision-making process, monetary policy has that flexibility.  When the history books are written, those seven or ten days will be quite something in terms of the minute-by-minute narrative. I think 11 March is the actual date the pandemic was declared. Then on 15 March, the Sunday evening, the Fed came out with their own statement, which obviously had a dramatic effect on the market on Monday. Then in terms of the actual lockdown measures, on 12 March, the day of our meeting, various countries announced lockdown measures and there were more measures announced on Monday 16 March. I think we can always reflect and say “should we have moved more on 12 March?”. But I think a lot did happen between 12 March and 18 March.  One of the big developments in those days is that the market crashed, and we know from your blog posts that you do watch financial markets closely. Do you see scope for the ECB or for a central bank to operate a bit more autonomously from the markets, which as we know have vicious circles built into them such leverage, herd behaviour and margins calls.  There is a long-running debate about the interaction between monetary policy and the market, which is different from the question you ask. One type of question is a cycle where markets in advance of monetary policy meetings form an expectation about what we’re going to do and whether that influences the decision making. So, under this narrative, “we don’t want to disappoint the market”. And, in that sense, the central bank is perceived to be influenced by markets. This “hall of mirrors” conundrum is a long-running debate. But a different point is that once the market goes under extreme stress a central bank has to intervene. The question behind this is: can we not design a regulatory system which reduces the risk of that kind of extreme stress? We think it’s been so important in this pandemic that this was largely addressed in the banking system. We have seen a lot of credit being provided in the last number of weeks. The banks have started this crisis with much higher capital ratios, much better liquidity ratios, less severe leverage ratios compared to previous crisis. So, there’s lot of progress in making sure the banking system was not a source of amplification in this crisis. The ECB has been consistent, whether under the current Vice-President or his predecessor beforehand, in highlighting that the same macroprudential insulation is not there for non-banks. So it is clear that having more macroproduential insulation in terms of more liquidity and less leverage makes the system less prone to shocks. But given the size of this shock, what we have now is a really large shock. So in case of tail events the central bank will be called upon to intervene.   Why do you only see the stress once the financial market flags it to you?  That’s essentially the way the central bank operates is in terms of influencing financial conditions. If financial conditions are in line with what we need, then we don’t have to intervene. If financial conditions get too tight, then we must offset that. So there is a direct connection between financial conditions and what is the appropriate stance for monetary policy. It really is about that transmission. Outside of stressed conditions, financial market participants are looking at the same macro data as we are. Financial conditions tend to move in the same direction we would move them anyway. Because we’re both looking at the inflation data, the hard data. That’s what simultaneously drives the market and determines our own projections. Most of the time, there is a deep interconnection between the market view and the central bank, because they’re both driven by the underlying fundamentals facing the world. But under conditions either of stress or bubble, they start to have an independent contribution.   When you say you fight unwarranted tightening in spreads, regardless of your definition of unwarranted, at some point that has to translate to basis points. Because, at some point, you to make a decision on “we buy now…”  This can be explained in different ways. You see, by the way, other episodes where spreads have gone up and the ECB has not responded.  So we are not, absolutely not, into yield-targeting or yield-curve control, that’s not part of what we’re doing. We don’t take any particular view on the level of the spread. What we do look at is whether financial markets have become one-sided. If there has been this kind of flight to cash, flight to safety, if everyone is trying to sell, then there no individual intermediary is going to be ready to stabilise the market by being on the buy-side. This is exactly the same as what we saw in the U.S. Treasury market. You can definitely have, in any market, the risk of a severe overshooting, because of the mass of traders who are trying to make the same trade, which at that time was to deleverage and raise cash.  So you can have a one-sided market, which you know will lead to overshooting. This is why the Fed intervened big time in the Treasury market in the U.S. In the euro area this is compounded by the fact there are 19 countries and you can switch between their sovereign bonds with no currency risk: The risk of instability is compounded by the fact that it is so easy to switch away from more vulnerable countries to less vulnerable countries. That switch could even occur when there is no change in fundamentals, when there is no change in macro projections. It can be entirely belief-driven. If you believe every other investor is running to the safe haven, it is individually rational for every investor to also run, so the market becomes one-sided. The central bank essentially acts as a stabilising force.  But that stabilisation is not a statement about the level of the yield. Because, as you know from the yield control debate, the only credible yield control or yield-targeting approach is a promise to buy everything. You can only target the yield if you promise to buy everything, which we do not. We announced a substantial programme and we said we’re going to use it flexibly. But in no sense it’s a kind of promise to deliver any particular type of spread. It worked in the way I expected. The announcement effect on March 18 led to a big initial drop in yields, because what mattered to the market was that it was no longer one-sided. Once you know there’s a significant stabilising force, that risk is eliminated. Lots of other risks remain and we don’t try to eliminate spreads. But the announcement effect was itself proof that the market had become unstable.     "
2020-07-01,Luis de Guindos,Interview with La Stampa,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Marco Zatterin on 26 June 2020 and published on 1 July 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 1 July 2020  Interview with La Stampa   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Marco Zatterin on 26 June 2020 and published on 1 July 2020   The International Monetary Fund has just revised down all of its projections. How is the European economy looking from the ECB’s perspective?  The level of uncertainty is very high, so various scenarios need to be considered while acknowledging that it is difficult to produce projections. In reality, one thing is certain: we have experienced a deep fall in economic activity. This fall was very rapid, very sharp, and took place within the space of two-and-a half-months. As governments have started to reopen their economies, we have begun to see a recovery in activity, with indicators pointing towards a rebound in a number of countries.  And yet there is persistent uncertainty.  It’s normal that that there should be a recovery when economies reopen, just as it’s normal not to know what will happen after the summer. Many unknowns and question marks remain. But the most worrying thing is that a two-speed recovery seems to be starting to emerge. The fall has been sharp everywhere, but in some countries it was steeper. There is a group of more resilient economies that reacted better than others. For this group, GDP will therefore increase at a faster pace. This could lead to two-speed growth in Europe. We must keep a close eye on this.  What lessons have you learned from the pandemic?  That, to a large extent, countries weren’t ready to deal with it at the beginning. This task falls to governments and public health authorities, it is not just an economic issue. The ECB acted quickly and effectively. But other EU tools, including fiscal instruments, would ensure that we are never taken by surprise again. We have understood that we need to complete Economic and Monetary Union. If we had completed the banking union, progressed towards a genuine capital markets union, and if we had had a common budgetary instrument for the euro area, the shock would have been more contained. The only way to avoid asymmetries in the fallout from the pandemic would have been to have had a single response in place at the European level.  Essentially, are you saying that with greater unity, Europe would have been stronger?  Exactly. That is what I mean.  The ECB’s response has nevertheless been massive. What is your assessment of its impact?  The ECB’s response focused on three pillars. We significantly increased our bond purchases, mostly sovereign bonds, we provided banks with huge amounts of liquidity to grant loans to the real economy, and together with the competent national authorities we introduced support measures for bank capital to avoid a credit squeeze on companies. The impact on the financial markets has been very positive. In addition, the measures taken have avoided fragmentation in the dynamics of bond prices, particularly for sovereign bonds, to ensure the smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanisms. Now the situation has improved, and financial conditions are not as tight as they were only two months ago. That means that the measures we have taken have had a positive effect. We have avoided a credit crunch which, when the economy was plummeting in the midst of a public health crisis, would have had significantly adverse consequences.   Is “Whatever it takes” still the ECB’s motto?  It was crucial in 2012. The crisis is different this time, and we have proven our determination by avoiding a squeeze on credit to the private sector and by improving financing conditions in general. Our commitment is unwavering. As is clear from our communication, we stand ready to recalibrate our non-standard measures and pandemic programmes – such as the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) – so that they can be adapted to suit the circumstances. The last time we did this was at the beginning of June when we increased volumes and extended the horizon.  Are you ready for a second wave of the virus?  I am not a virologist, but as a central banker, I know that we must prepare for the worst while hoping for the best. A second wave is a distinct possibility.  And if it comes?  Monetary policy is not the only tool we have. National fiscal policy has been the first line of defence this time around. It has worked well, but the reaction has been asymmetric because the same measure cannot be applied everywhere and not all countries have the same amount of fiscal space. That’s why I believe that a pan-European fiscal response is important to avoid what I mentioned earlier, i.e. a two-speed recovery. That’s why we need to complete monetary union, and have a genuine banking union, a single capital market and a common budgetary instrument.  The measures you have taken have suffered a blow following the ruling of the German Federal Constitutional Court. How do you feel about that?  I don’t want to comment on the rulings made by the national courts. It is important to remember that the ECB falls under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. We are a European institution. We are accountable to the European Parliament and, from an operational standpoint, we are subject to scrutiny by the European Court of Auditors. We do not answer to the national courts, but only to EU bodies. That said, through the Bundesbank, documents that explain the suitability of our actions were provided to German institutions. This happened already in the past. We have decided to cooperate while at all times respecting the principle of the ECB’s full independence.  A principle for which, when the EU treaties were being drafted, the Germans fought tooth and nail.  That’s exactly right. I don’t think anyone can disagree.  What would a two-speed recovery mean for Italy?   For Italy, the problem is primarily related to growth, which was already close to zero before the coronavirus. It’s a question of productivity, competitiveness and structural reforms that are still to be completed. In this phase of the crisis, national fiscal policies have to be expansionary. In the short term there is no alternative but to spend. But once the emergency is behind us, all countries with high debt levels – not just Italy – must resume their efforts to address the problem of medium-term sustainability and compliance with the parameters set by the EU.  The ECB has been criticised for being too “pro-Italy”. It has been said by the “frugal” countries that you helped Rome to not implement reforms.  I have no objections to being described as “pro-Italy” because it would mean being “pro-Europe”. I am pro-Italy, or pro-France, or pro-Spain, I am also pro-Germany. We are all in the same boat.   From the perspective of a politician, do you envisage or do you fear that there will be social tensions when the pandemic is over?  When I was a minister I was called a “technocrat” and now I am being asked to speak as a “politician”! That’s life. But, now seriously, this crisis will leave scars and we must minimise the potential damage. This calls for major action in terms of fiscal policy. The new reality will be more complex because GDP will fall significantly and there will be an impact on employment and on standards of living for Europeans. The main antidote will not be monetary policy – which of course we will conduct being mindful that we are not almighty – but reforms and fiscal measures by governments. In our work, we will also aim to reduce the effects on inequalities.  Let’s talk about the banks. You have avoided a credit crunch. But the banks have been criticised for being slow to provide liquidity to firms.  The banks are not to blame in this crisis, and they should be part of the solution. The shock has created uncertainty and the fear of a financial market crash. The need to avoid a credit crunch required the combination of two factors: ensuring that liquidity reaches banks, which we have done, and activating the public guarantee schemes that are necessary to channel funds to firms. At the start there were actually many doubts as well as bureaucratic problems. It was not an easy task. Now, however, the national guarantees have started to operate. Liquidity is flowing. We have avoided the worst.  The return of the virus could cause an explosion in banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs).  According to staff analysis, government loan guarantee schemes, if fully deployed, could transfer about 30% of losses from banks to the public sector, on average across euro area countries. The impact of NPLs would be reduced, even if NPLs are set to rise. Bank profitability is very low and will be further dented by the crisis. A first measure to support the banking sector would be completion of the banking union with the approval of the missing third pillar, namely the common European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). This would provide reassurance for citizens, savers and markets. I hope it can be achieved soon.  Do you believe that the capital requirements for banks need to be increased?  In this temporary emergency, things are moving in the opposite direction. The ECB has temporarily eased the capital requirements for banks, which were in a better position at the start of this crisis than they were for the previous crisis. We ask this flexibility to be used to grant loans and to avoid a credit crunch. The more solid capital position must be used, in conjunction with the buffers, to support the economy.  Are there too many banks? Should there be some consolidation?  Banks should address the issue of low profitability which, for the European banking system, is extremely contained and will suffer from the effects of the crisis. They should double or triple efforts to cut costs, make structural changes and increase efficiency. This process in many cases would ultimately require consolidation, which will be key at the national level for small and medium-sized credit institutions, but also at the European level for larger credit institutions.  There is talk of a bad bank for NPLs. What do you think of that?   The priorities need to be clear. The first is to complete the banking union with the third pillar. Reopening and concluding the debate on EDIS would send a very strong signal. Other solutions can then be considered. When I was Minister for the Economy in Spain, a bad bank was shown to be a valid tool. But there are other things to do first. Having this discussion now is premature.  Looking ahead, do you subscribe to the notion of the “new normal” when the pandemic is over?   I don’t like talking about a “new normal”. Normal is normal. There’s the new and the old. I prefer to think of a new reality. We have learned a lot from the threat of the virus and its consequences for globalisation. I am in favour of globalisation, but it has its pros and cons, particularly because a pandemic can now spread more rapidly. We have learned the importance of the role of the healthcare system, that the world economy was not prepared for lockdown and that the security of the global supply chain needs to be considered. I hope that a vaccine will soon be found. It will be a more digital world, which will bring advantages but will also have an impact on inequalities. Europe will have a competitive advantage in terms of combatting the climate emergency. All in all, we will have a “new reality” rather than a “new normal”, which I hope will be as close as possible to the “old normal”.  What have you missed the most during lockdown?  The most novel experience was not meeting up with friends. I missed football and Atlético de Madrid. But above all I missed my two grandchildren.   "
2020-06-22,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Der Spiegel,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Tim Bartz and Stefan Kaiser on 15 June and published on 22 June 2020","   INTERVIEW 22 June 2020  Interview with Der Spiegel   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Tim Bartz and Stefan Kaiser on 15 June and published on 22 June 2020  Because of the Corona pandemic, the ECB is buying euro area government and corporate bonds for 1.35 trillion euros on the capital market. In doing so, it is depressing their interest rates and helping countries like Italy to obtain fresh money cheaply by selling new bonds. German critics, in particular, accuse you of this being state financing by the central bank. Rightly so?  Monetary financing is prohibited by the Treaty and ECB’s decisions are driven by our price stability mandate. We are experiencing a severe economic crisis. Our forecasts predict that, in the medium scenario, the euro area economy will shrink by almost nine percent in 2020 and that prices will only rise by 0.3 percent. This is significantly lower than our inflation target of just under two percent. We are therefore buying more bonds in order to promote economic growth, achieve our inflation target and prevent fragmentation in the euro area, a too strong tightening of financing conditions in euro area countries. We are acting solely according to the principles of our mandate. Against this big drop in GDP and inflation, we had to act. It is our duty to do the necessary within our mandate.  The ECB is currently discussing a new strategy. We have a suggestion for you: Call out 0.5 or 1.0 percent as the new inflation target, then you will have virtually fulfilled your mandate in no time and can stop buying bonds.  It's really not that simple. But yes, in the context of the strategy review, we will be looking at the inflation target. We will also listen to a wide range of stakeholders, academics, civil society.  Perhaps you are also measuring inflation incorrectly. Residential property has been getting more expensive for years, stock prices are rising, and many people feel that life as a whole is becoming much more expensive than the official data suggest.  Eurostat calculates inflation for the euro area on the basis of data from each country. This measurement of inflation is considered appropriate. However, it is always possible to improve it and we are looking into this, e.g. the treatment of owner-occupied housing. In our strategy review we will take great account of what you mention in your comments. Unfortunately, the pandemic postponed the work, we now aim at presenting the new strategy in mid-2021.  If asset prices for real estate and stocks continue to rise, the rich will become even richer. Those who have little or no assets will go away empty-handed. That increases social inequality.  The best policy against social inequality is to create growth and jobs. Monetary policy has greatly helped to achieve this. Please do not forget that, in the present juncture, as in 2015 and 2016, we have deflationary pressures that we have to deter.  Is it even possible to get out of crisis policy? The US central bank, the Fed, tried to do so at the end of 2018, raising interest rates and sending global capital markets into a panic.  The ECB also decided in 2018 to stop net purchases of government bonds. So you can see that we can get out if the economic conditions and inflation data allow it. At that time, we had to relaunch the programme after ten months due to economic weakness and decreasing price pressure. But if the situation improves and the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level which is in line with our mandate, we can return to exit mode.  Do you really think that's still possible? The ECB itself says that factors such as the ageing of society and globalisation are exerting long-term pressure on inflation. Then you will never again reach your inflation target of just under two percent and will continue to do so with bond purchases and give critics a cause for allegations of implicit government financing. I see no reason why inflation shouldn't increase again. At the moment, the pandemic is depressing global demand and oil prices, and therefore consumer prices. Our forecasts are clear in that they will remain low for some time. But de-globalisation and the disruption of global value chains could also be pushing inflation up.  Are you breaking the law because you are buying many more Italian government bonds than the country's capital key at the ECB? Most recently, you bought about 20 percent Italian securities, but according to the capital key it would only be 14 percent.  No, for the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the benchmark allocation continues to be the capital key, but we use the flexibility it offers us over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions.  What do you mean?  Above all, that in the end there will be a reckoning. We will ensure convergence to the capital key.   You would simply have to extend the program again and again, so you would never have to prove that you are following the rules, because the final settlement never comes.  I cannot foresee what will happen and therefore I cannot rule out extending the programme, but we’ve clearly said that our pandemic emergency purchase programme is temporary and under the current conditions we have stipulated that the programme will end in June 2021. Until then, we are using the flexibility we have.  How do you actually explain the boom on the stock markets? After the outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe and the USA, the markets slumped by more than 30 percent, and have since recovered their losses. How can that be?  There could be two factors at play: the measures promptly taken by the central bank and governments to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic generated some optimism. In addition, until recently, the view that the public health pandemic has been largely controlled had prevailed. All this had a positive impact on the stock markets. But we also know that markets sometimes overreact, both downwards and upwards. At the start of the pandemic we saw large drops in equity prices.   So you think that stock markets exaggerate and share prices will fall again?  I wouldn't say that. It will depend on the evolution of the pandemic. Ultimately, stock markets must remain realistic: we are facing a recession in the euro area.  What is the mood in the ECB towers? At the last meeting under former President Mario Draghi in autumn 2019, the massive crack in the central bank Council due to Draghi's monetary policy became apparent. Now the situation seems more relaxed. Is the pandemic masking the crack?  The past is the past. And I think that Mario Draghi’s successor Christine Lagarde took office with the intention of listening to everyone. Also in Draghi’s times, 99 percent of all decisions were taken unanimously.  The decisive factor is one percent disagreement. Like in autumn 2019, when the ECB suddenly started buying government bonds again. And at that time the coronavirus did not even exist.  There are always nuances. There are very knowledgeable people in the Governing Council, who sometimes vote differently. But in general, the degree of agreement is enormous.  Does that also apply to the head of the Bundesbank? The fact is that the Federal Government now handles money much more loosely and reacts more pragmatically to the crisis. Do you notice this new German flexibility also in Jens Weidmann?  The German economic stimulus package is very positive. Such programmes are the first line of defence to minimise the consequences of the pandemic. The German government's response is the right one and Germany has the financial leeway to react quickly and intensively. I believe that a fiscal response is also necessary on a pan-European level. It's not only about the size and scope of the programme, but about the message. A European response makes it very clear that there is a response from the core and the heart of the EU. And that is politically very important.  What about the Bundesbank?   I don't comment on the Bundesbank’s view. The Bundesbank has always taken a cooperative and positive attitude and made important and relevant contributions. The Bundesbank is a very, very independent institution. I can assure you of that.  As independent as the Federal Constitutional Court. That accuses the ECB of disproportionate and poorly communicated monetary policy. What next?  Our position is clear: we are a European institution and are subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice accountable to the EU Parliament as well as the European Court of Auditors. We have taken note of the judgment from Karlsruhe. Our monetary policy decisions have always been proportionate and appropriate. I expect that the Federal Government and the Bundestag will react to this. We stand ready to cooperate with the Bundesbank and to provide information to facilitate the response that the German institutions have to give to the Constitutional Court. So we are ready to cooperate, but always with full respect of our independence.  Meaning: the Bundesbank has the buck.  Well, that's your way of saying things. Once again: we are under the control of the European institutions, but we are open to cooperate with the German institutions. That is the approach.   Why is it always the Germans who cause trouble?   I don't think it's the Germans who make trouble. You know, it's the largest country in the euro area.   But they seem to have the biggest problem with the ECB's monetary policy, and above all they fear inflation more than the other Europeans.  Inflation is well below our target. In addition, Germany's growth rate has been positive over the past ten years, Germany is a very competitive economy, and the favourable euro exchange rate has also been positive. So I think that the euro has been very beneficial for the German economy and that this is recognised by most Germans.  Should Jens Weidmann send out this message more strongly because it apparently has too little resonance in Germany?   I cannot speak on his behalf. But when I listen to his remarks in the Governing Council of the ECB, I can agree very often with his comments.   Wouldn't it be better if the ECB focused its strategy much more strongly on growth rather than inflation in the future, if only to end this eternal cycle of complaints against your monetary policy?  Our mandate is enshrined in the Treaty, it has been decided by governments and parliaments, and we have no say. Whether the treaties and the mandate will be changed in the future is not known, certainly not a matter for today.   As ex-Economy Minister of Spain, you must have an opinion on such a question.   I had other priorities then. We had a difficult time, the recovery of the Spanish economy was very important. So I concentrated on other type of issues.   As Vice-President of the ECB, you are responsible for financial stability and the banks. Are you sure that the banks in the eurozone are strong enough to absorb credit defaults, which will certainly come?  European banks are, on average, in a much better capital and liquidity situation than ten years ago. The problem of European banks is that their profitability was very, very low even before the pandemic. This is clearly reflected in bank valuations in the stock markets. So profitability is the real problem. And I think that the pandemic will make this situation even worse. Since the beginning of the crisis, the valuations of European banks have fallen by 30 percent. I think that this also justifies the rapid policy responses to the pandemic.   So what must the banks do?   Cost cutting, reducing excess capacity and – for some of them - consolidating domestically and across borders. Much of what has been necessary already in the past is now completely unavoidable.  Is it true ECB has set up a taskforce to look into the idea of creating a European bad bank?  We haven’t taken any decision or entered into any detail about this. It’s premature having this discussion now.    "
2020-06-16,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Le Monde,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert, and published on 16 June 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 16 June 2020  Interview with Le Monde   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eric Albert, and published on 16 June 2020   In March, the ECB launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a package of €750 billion. On 4 June, it added €600 billion. At the speed you are using it, it will all be spent by February 2021 and more will be needed. Is your policy working?  Yes, it is working. But we’re fighting against strong headwinds. So we need forceful measures to avoid the tightening of credit conditions, stabilise the economy and thus respond to inflation moving further away from our aim. This is why we recently decided to expand the PEPP by €600 billion. We have a pragmatic approach and we stand ready to adjust our policy in line with our mandate, based on our assessment of the medium-term outlook. At the moment, there is still a lot of uncertainty around how the public health and economic situation will develop. It would have been unwise to go for the “full monty” –using our firepower to a larger extent – without a clearer picture.  What would the “full monty” look like then? How about a write-off of sovereign debts, which is a popular idea with some economists in France?  The Treaty on the Functioning of the EU is clear: Article 123 forbids monetary financing. If we buy sovereign bonds and decide not to eventually seek repayment, it would be monetary financing and thus it would not be legally allowed. I am aware of the ongoing debate in France on the idea of cancelling debts. But this is just not an option for the ECB. And not only due to the legal constraints: it would expose us to citizens losing trust in the currency, similar to what happened in some countries when people needed to push around wheelbarrows of banknotes because the banknotes had basically lost their value. It would end in financial disorder. This is not the path to prosperity and this is why the Treaty forbids monetary financing.   Another idea is simply to roll over debts in perpetuity, or at least for a very long time...   We have a reinvestment policy, which means we will roll over debts until it is necessary to do otherwise to achieve our price stability objective.   The Federal Reserve already buys so-called fallen angels. Are you in favour of this?  We have shown that we are ready to take all the necessary measures to reach our inflation objective and we are still guided by this aim. Fallen angels? We haven’t discussed it in the Governing Council but we will consider that if necessary.  Debt in many European countries will be very high after the crisis, especially in Italy. It will be next to impossible to increase interest rates or tighten monetary policy. Have we not entered a new era of monetary policy, with rates that will stay low for a very long time?  Based on the inflation outlook, I expect a prolonged period of very accommodative monetary policy to fulfil our mandate. This offers the right conditions to national and European authorities to stimulate growth, to conduct reforms to improve competitiveness and to make sure that we exit this crisis better placed to deal with future challenges.  Let’s turn to fiscal policy. The European Commission has proposed a new €750 billion package, including €500 billion of grants. It would be a historical move. However, it looks like nothing will be agreed at the EU summit this week (19 June). How urgent is it for them to act?  It is extremely urgent and the aim should be to deploy it as soon as possible, no later than early 2021. The longer we wait, the costlier it will be to intervene. Both fiscal and monetary policy need to work hand in hand to bring the economy back on track as soon as possible. To be effective, fiscal policy needs to modernise the economy, for instance by investing in human capital, technology and the protection of the environment.   Are European authorities doing too little, too late?  European authorities have already delivered measures that were unimaginable only three months ago, and we have to be realistic; the political debate takes time. European authorities have shown a remarkable awareness of the need to intervene. I remain optimistic.   This might be so but, meanwhile, Euroscepticism is rising, especially in your country, Italy. How dangerous is it?  Euroscepticism has been largely motivated by the mistakes made in the financial crisis and, more recently, by the immigration crisis. Reactions to the coronavirus shock have been very different. European authorities have acted much more decisively, and they have delivered, despite sometimes harsh discussions. Italy, like all other countries, will benefit from European spending through the issuance of EU debt. The announcement by France and Germany was very important in pushing towards an ambitious European response. Germany was perceived by some as resisting a common European policy. This perception has changed. As for the ECB, we have learned the lessons of the sovereign debt crisis and acted rapidly and forcefully. Acting together means acting more effectively. And all Europeans are benefiting.   Are you saying that the pandemic has actually been a time when Europe proved it could act?  “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises,” as Jean Monnet once said. European integration is a constant process. It sometimes seems slow, but who would have thought ten years ago that countries would give up responsibilities for banking supervision? That EU authorities would now bring forward a forceful fiscal response, amounting to 10% of GDP? Probably no one. Day to day, we might not see progress. But 20 years from now, those who write the history books might well see this coronavirus shock as a turning point for European integration: a key moment for Europe, when we all understood that addressing challenges together brings benefits to everyone.  The euro was launched 20 years ago, but it has not become a meaningful competitor to the dollar, which is still used three times as much in international reserves. Is it a failure?  I believe the euro could and should have a bigger international role. This has not happened because the institutional framework of the euro area is incomplete. To reduce the gap with the dollar and for all Member States to benefit from the euro’s global currency status, the euro area needs to offer international investors a common safe asset and deep, liquid European capital markets. It must also continue to react forcefully to crises, through policies designed for the benefit of the euro area as a whole. And we, as a central bank, also need to live up to our responsibilities, acting decisively as we did in this crisis, and providing a liquidity backstop to holders of liabilities in euro in phases of turbulence.  Does this mean the ECB should be ready to be an international lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve?  Personally, I do think we should do more in this direction, yes.  Bulgaria and Croatia are next in line to join the euro. Is it really a good idea to accept countries whose economies are very different and which are much poorer than other euro area countries?  A country can only join the euro area after a serious convergence process, comprising institutional convergence, financial convergence and macroeconomic convergence.  Sure, but Greece had a convergence process. It didn’t end up well, did it?  Maybe in the past the importance of convergence and, in particular, of all its facets, was underestimated. Today, we take convergence more seriously: to be accepted in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II, a two-year process before formally adopting the currency), countries now have to accept banking supervision by the ECB, for instance. And Croatia and Bulgaria took bold measures to converge.   When will they join?  If the process is completed successfully, they could join ERM II by the end of the year. So, the first available window for Croatia and Bulgaria to join the euro area would be 2023, if all preliminary assessments are successful.    "
2020-06-14,Luis de Guindos,Interview with ABC,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by María Jesús Pérez on 9 June 2020 and published on 14 June 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 14 June 2020  Interview with ABC   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by María Jesús Pérez on 9 June 2020 and published on 14 June 2020   European economics and finance ministers met on Tuesday to discuss the EU recovery plan to deal with a post-COVID-19 scenario using guarantees. Why wasn’t there an agreement?  A consensus has not been reached yet and some countries seem reluctant to sign an agreement, but we are confident that they will be able to do so at the end of July. A strong European response is essential to ensure that every country is included in the recovery.  In any case, the coronavirus crisis is wreaking havoc on the world economy. In Europe, for example, the ECB was expecting the economy to grow by 0.8% this year. But last week ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that it would contract by 8.7% in 2020, which is a downward revision to your projections of almost 10% and an “unprecedented contraction” in the euro area economy. Is the situation likely to worsen or will the support packages approved by the Eurogroup and by the ECB be enough to bring about a recovery?   There is currently a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the economic projections. GDP fell by 3.6% in Europe in the first quarter. Our projections see GDP shrinking by 13% in the second quarter, and we expect the economy to start to recover from the third quarter onwards. That would mean an overall decline of 8.7%. However, there is so much uncertainty that we are working with three potential scenarios. These range from the mildest, which is very unlikely and entails a decline of just under 6%, to the most severe, in which we see GDP declining by over 12%. The final data will be determined by economic developments once most of the restrictions that we have been living under as a result of the need to impose a lockdown have been lifted. We saw the worst of the situation around the middle of April.  Are you ruling out an increase in the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) after the summer, or is another new injection of funds possible?  We have just increased the PEPP. We started with €750 billion in March and we increased that by €600 billion to €1,350 billion on 4 June, with purchases that will be conducted until at least the first half of 2021. It’s an enormous purchase volume and comes on top of the Asset Purchase Programme (APP), the ordinary debt purchase programme that we already had, with purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion, and to which we added a further €120 billion in March. With all of this, our purchases would come to €1,700 billion, which is a huge amount. And, depending on economic conditions and our inflation projections, we are always open to recalibrating the programme.  Do you monitor whether this capital is being used correctly?  Our purchases are not conditional. To decide on the appropriateness and proportionality of the programme, the ECB takes into account inflation expectations, which are now lower than before the pandemic, and financial conditions. We try to prevent a tightening of financial conditions because that would have a severe impact on credit and sovereign bonds and could lead to fragmentation in the euro area. The asset purchases are allocated in accordance with the capital key, which is calculated based on the GDP and population of each country. And in the PEPP we have greater flexibility in its implementation.   In general, countries spend, then they borrow to pay for their spending, and to ensure that the cost of debt doesn’t weigh too heavily on their budgets, the ECB buys that debt. Then what? Don’t you think we’ll be living in a world flooded with liquidity, with lots of social expenditure, very limited productive investment and high levels of unemployment?  The ECB focuses on its inflation aim and on ensuring that there isn’t a tightening of financial conditions, because that would have very negative consequences and we must prevent any fragmentation in the bond markets. We are taking the necessary measures to tackle the pandemic. The quality of public finances is the responsibility of governments and the European Commission, which, as it’s known, in the current circumstances, will not be calling for the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. At the ECB, as I’ve already said, our actions are guided by our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The current projections show inflation at 1.3% in 2022, so we are still a long way from the aim and our stimulus measures are necessary.   It finally seems that support for the southern European countries will come, despite the reluctance of their northern counterparts. Do you think there will be any strings attached to this support? Will the support for Spain come without any conditions?  It’s very important that the European Commission’s recovery plan for the post-COVID-19 economy is approved, not only because of how much money is involved but also because of the message of united action that it sends out. Monetary policy cannot be the only European policy being used to counteract the impact of the pandemic on European economies. An agreement would send a message that there is political will to do so among all countries. The proposed plan will be linked to the European Semester, which coordinates economic and budgetary policies within the EU. The Commission has initially given carte blanche for fiscal policy action in the short term, but it will ensure that public finances are brought back onto a sustainable path over the medium term.   The Banco de España’s projections for the Spanish economy and its recovery have been another heavy blow. It previously warned that extending the lockdown would mean a longer recession and higher unemployment, but nobody listened. Yesterday it made further downward revisions to its GDP and unemployment forecasts given the lack of effective measures from the government. You said that if things are done correctly, we will see a rebound and a return to pre-crisis levels of activity. Have you changed your view after seeing the Banco de España’s forecasts?   At the ECB we are constantly in touch with the national central banks. The Banco de España’s projections are in line with what we have published for the euro area as a whole. There are signs that economic activity is picking up as countries are reopening their economies and lifting restrictions on movement, lockdown measures and the like. What’s key is knowing how quickly countries will be able to recover what was lost during the four months from March to June. And for that recovery to take place as soon as possible, every country must ensure the survival of most of the businesses that were active before the crisis.  How can they do that?  One way is by introducing liquidity support measures, such as government loan guarantee schemes – like through the ICO (Official Credit Institute [in Spanish:   Instituto de Crédito Oficial]) in Spain – and by trying to minimise the costs borne by companies at a time when they have practically no income. And through temporary unemployment schemes, such as the ERTE temporary layoff scheme [in Spanish: expedientes de regulación temporal, or ERTE] in Spain. The shock received has been huge. The Banco de España sees the Spanish economy shrinking by between 15% and 20% in the second quarter. And the ECB sees a contraction of 13% in the euro area as a whole. The main question is: how can we reboot economies with as much force as possible and ensure that countries are quick to address the gap in income, unemployment and the economic downturn brought about by the pandemic? For that to happen, it’s vital that as many businesses as possible survive. Businesses that were solvent before the pandemic must still be solvent afterwards, because they are the ones that must drive the economy.   And is Spain doing the right things to bring about this rebound? Are the measures taken the ones that we need? Are they the right ones? What still needs to be done?  I’m not going to comment on specific countries. Generally speaking, every country should have loan guarantees, support measures such as tax moratoria, the possibility of postponing social security contributions during this period, and temporary employment schemes like the ERTE. All of these measures will lead to a very significant increase in the public deficit and fiscal policy planning will be needed to address this expenditure. After all the fiscal efforts required right now, once the pandemic is over, countries will of course be left with something they won’t be able to avoid: a very significant increase in the government debt-to-GDP ratio. On average, the debt-to-GDP ratio for the euro area as a whole could increase by between 15 and 20 percentage points. This situation is the result of an expansionary fiscal policy required to tackle the pandemic, and it will have to be addressed in the future so that the public deficit can return to a path that is considered to be sustainable over the medium term.   By cutting public spending and putting up taxes?  It will depend on each country. But every euro area country will have to deal with this new economic situation after heavy public spending programmes and a significant dip in tax revenues. This will lead to a larger hole in the public finances which will have to be covered by government debt. The ECB’s debt purchases are preventing a fragmentation of bond markets and a tightening of financial conditions, which is greatly helping all countries prevent the health and economic crisis from being exacerbated by a debt crisis.  Once we see a return to growth, countries will have to address the situation by reducing this extraordinary spending and recovering tax revenues. This will be an individual task for each country. But it will be of vital importance and, as the Governor of the Banco de España said, it will require a fiscal consolidation plan lasting several years.   You were in favour of a minimum income, but one which was temporary and linked to the length and impact of the pandemic. What do you think about the minimum income that has finally been approved in Spain?  I am personally in favour of a temporary emergency minimum income for those hardest hit by the crisis. This has been done in a structural way in Spain. It is a legitimate social policy decision which, as ECB Vice-President, I am not going to comment on. Generally speaking, it’s important that these kinds of support measures don’t discourage people from seeking employment and that they are funded in a sustainable manner over the medium term. And, in any case, job creation is without a doubt the best social policy to tackle poverty and emerge from this crisis.   In your view, what have other countries done better than Spain to manage the crisis?  When you look at the action plans of each Member State, their basic principles are all very similar. There are three key courses of action. The first is government guarantees so that the banks will grant loans. The second is moratoria on tax payments, social security contributions and the like. And the third is temporary employment schemes, such as the ERTE.  But not all countries have the same fiscal capacity. Those countries with less debt and lower deficits have been able to embark on more ambitious programmes. And this is precisely why a pan-European response is essential. We have to avoid a situation in which some countries are left behind in the recovery because they had less fiscal space to address the public health crisis and the ensuing economic crisis.   In your opinion, economic policy in Europe should focus on saving as many businesses as possible. The Spanish government has opted to focus its support measures on workers, with moratoria, the ERTE scheme and subsidies. But in many cases these aren’t reaching the workers or are taking a long time to reach them. What do you make of this?  The ERTE scheme also helps businesses. It was reformed in 2012 and is proving to be extremely useful. The government pays part of the wages and social security contributions, which helps businesses and means that, in the event of a downturn, they don’t have to make redundancies.  Do you take it as a positive that the ERTE scheme may be extended until December in specific sectors?  That is a decision for the unions, employers and the government. A major advantage of the ERTE is that it limits companies’ expenditure but it also has a budgetary cost, which is why it is a decision that must be taken by the government in conjunction with labour and management stakeholders.   Is there concern at European level that Spain has a government with so many diverse viewpoints, and that there is so much improvisation and haste to implement measures which are perhaps not in line with the European project?   I am not going to get into assessing the performance of any government. Member States will have to submit their programmes and action plans for reforms, investment, etc. to the European Commission, and it will be up to the Commission to evaluate those plans, not me.   Some experts, pundits and even politicians with different views to those at the heart of government are raising doubts about whether the issue of nationalisation has been completely resolved at European level. It has been approved that, in certain situations, the government may become a shareholder in companies that are failing as a result of the coronavirus crisis.  As a result of the pandemic, the Commission has waived the application of State aid rules. But some countries are in a better position than others to inject funds, and fragmentation of the Single Market must be avoided. That’s why it’s essential to restore the core principles for granting aid. We are currently experiencing an exceptional situation but we must not let it become structural. As things gradually get back to normal, State aid must once again be governed by the principles of free competition and preservation of the Single Market. These common rules must be restored as soon as possible, and I am sure that they will be.   What is your take on the political tension we have recently been seeing in Spain’s lower house? Shouldn’t there be greater unity and consensus to get the country out of what is the most severe economic crisis it has seen since the Civil War?  The current recession is even worse than the one that occurred between 2009 and 2013. It is the worst on record since the Civil War. It will affect public finances; there will be a drop in incomes, and more poverty. Measures will have to be taken on many economic and social fronts which will require consensus at the highest level. In this respect, it is obviously much better to have a coordinated approach between the government and the main opposition parties. The recovery plan will be very complex, it will have to deal with many different variables, and reaching a consensus will obviously be vital. That would require leaving dogmatic approaches to one side, a great deal of transparency, a great deal of commitment, and the willingness of politicians to achieve that consensus. Clearly, for the future of the Spanish economy, reaching a consensus on the recovery plan will be vital.  The European Banking Authority has confirmed that Spanish banks are facing the coronavirus crisis with the lowest level of capital in Europe, while noting that they were among those with the lowest leverage ratios. How will the banks, and Spanish banks in particular, recover from this crisis? Were they ready to deal with a crisis of this kind?   Europe’s banking sector has more capital and is much more resilient than it was ten years ago. It is therefore in a much better position to face the crisis. Its main problem is low profitability. Profit levels were already low before the crisis, and have fallen even further, and this can be seen from banks’ stock market valuations; currently banks are priced at 70% below their book value on average. In some cases, the figure is even higher, at 80% or 90%. The crisis will put more pressure on profitability. Consequently, what was essential before the crisis will now be even more so, including the need to reduce cost/income ratios or to proceed with consolidation or restructuring processes. We also have to keep in mind that a bank’s solvency is not measured by its capital ratio alone, but by other variables, such as the level of provisions or the efficiency of the system. In the last ten years, the Spanish banking sector has undergone an intensive clean-up and consolidation process, which is why it is currently not giving cause for concern.  Will mergers make a return? How many banks should Spain have for the system to be entirely cleaned up? Should three big banks absorb all the others?   The ECB does not shape the market. Profitability was low before the crisis and will be further affected by it. Provisions will increase, there will be a rise in the number of defaults and non-performing loans, and this will affect the profit and loss account, further reducing the bottom line. Faced with this situation, banks will have to react. The ECB believes that consolidation could help to reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of certain banks, but it’s not the supervisor’s role to say what form specific operations should take. ECB Banking Supervision has taken steps, such as requesting the suspension of dividend payments, so that banks use their funds to maintain lending volumes and don’t make the recession worse.   Regarding the cancellation of dividends, will the ECB “recommend” that payments be suspended beyond October? What measures will it take against banks that don’t comply with its recommendation?  The ECB Supervisory Board will reassess the situation. At the moment, the recommendation is to suspend dividend payments until at least October, and a decision will be taken before then about a possible extension. The aim is to use the funds that would have been distributed as dividends to grant loans in order to help the recovery and help banks maintain their own solvency levels. It is a recommendation, and as such is not mandatory. But like all the other supervisory recommendations made, the banks pay a great deal of attention to them.   Will the ECB create a bad bank in the end?  Bad banks have been created in some countries. “Sareb” was created in Spain, and it has been a very efficient tool for cleaning up the sector. But the ECB has not taken any decision or entered into any detail about the possibility of creating a bad bank at the European level. It is too early for this discussion at the moment.   What is your opinion on borders opening back up and flows of tourists as the summer approaches?  We must strike a balance between health and the economy. For countries like Spain, where tourism plays a crucial role, opening up the borders helps with exiting the crisis and making progress on the recovery front. It is a vital step to help reboot the economy with as much force as possible and offset some of the contraction seen over the last four months. It is therefore important, but health must always be taken into account and we must be on our guard to ensure the epidemic is kept under control.   To reopen and revive the economy, isn’t it a great idea that we’re now talking about revoking the labour market reforms?   Spanish labour market reforms have played a vital role in creating employment in the country since 2012. What’s more, the ERTE for example, provides clear evidence of how the tools that were improved as part of these reforms are helping substantially. To face the major crisis triggered by this global pandemic, it is important to provide certainty and be predictable.  Given what we’ve seen and what we’ve gone through, how many times a day do you give thanks for having left the Spanish government when you did?  That was almost two-and-a-half years ago. I decided to leave the ministry because the ECB is a wonderful place to work. I was a minister for six-and-a-half years, in fairly tricky economic circumstances. But numerous economic and financial reforms were introduced that laid the foundations for the recovery. From a professional viewpoint, it was excellent, in spite of the difficulties, and I am also very satisfied from a personal viewpoint. And now I’m delighted to be at the ECB.   One last question. Mário Centeno’s departure from the neighbouring Portuguese government opens the door to his succession at the helm of the Eurogroup, and apparently the Spanish Vice-President Nadia Calviño is among the candidates. What do you think of her potential candidacy? Spain would once again have several representatives in very important financial institutions.  I don’t know who will go for this position, but, generally speaking, I will always be in favour of having Spanish representatives in important positions in international organisations, because it shows that the country can have an influence.  Spain already suffered a “bailout” during the last crisis, although not the entire country, just the financial sector. You witnessed it first-hand. Do you think Spain will end up being bailed out? Some economists are sure it will be, although they say they would not describe it in this way...  Spain asked for a bank rescue package in 2012 of up to €100 billion, of which €40 billion was used. This loan from the European Stability Mechanism was essential to clean up the financial system which, at the end of the day, enabled the economy to grow. It is up to the government to review the situation and decide if it must take that decision.   Still on the subject of Spain, when times were good, the country did not reduce its debt levels and is now facing the crisis from a poor starting position. Will this debt not be a burden for future generations and hamper the recovery and our ability to create jobs again if we don’t solve this issue?  The crisis triggered by this public health emergency requires governments throughout the euro area to make a fiscal effort, which will lead to bigger deficits and higher debt levels. By purchasing assets, the ECB is avoiding fragmentation and enabling governments to obtain financing on the market. It is also essential to have a pan-European response to this problem to ensure that all countries can get back on the path to economic recovery. Once this has been achieved, governments will have to adopt measures to ensure that their public finances are sustainable in the medium term.   "
2020-06-11,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabella Bufacchi on 8 June","   INTERVIEW 11 June 2020  Interview with Il Sole 24 Ore   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabella Bufacchi on 8 June  The ECB does not tolerate fragmentation, yet the pandemic is making the eurozone more fragmented than ever because fiscal responses and economic and social damage are asymmetric. Italy is at the forefront as one of the hardest-hit countries, with less fiscal space and high public debt. How will Italy’s recovery out of the COVID-19 crisis be helped by the ECB, and by being a member of the euro?  This pandemic is a severe shock for all countries: it is a truly global shock. Italy's GDP projections are a little bit below the average euro area baseline scenario: the Banca d’Italia sees GDP contracting by 9.2% in Italy this year compared to a euro area average of -8.7%. But most importantly, the whole euro area is going through a big recession this year. And not only is the entire euro area severely affected, but being part of the euro area also provides a lot of benefits in terms of responding to the shock. We had a pandemic, which is a common shock, and a common response from the ECB as the common central bank. This is very important since it is unlikely that individually all countries could have responded on the same scale. When this big shock arrived in the middle of March, the ECB responded decisively to stabilise financial markets because there was a huge dislocation. The ECB showed it could be an anchor of stability and prevent self-fulfilling dynamics that otherwise could have escalated. In this respect, the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) has so far played two roles in the pandemic: first, it provides a market stabilisation tool, and second, it helps to make sure that the tightening of financial conditions was offset.  The ECB has stabilised the markets because conditions were getting tighter. How severe was the tightening and do you see some signs of normalisation?   In the middle of March the world realised that COVID-19 was going to be a really very large shock, and financial markets had to adjust to all this very quickly. But when a shock is so large and uncertainty exceptionally high, it is difficult to have adjustments that are orderly and smooth. So it was very important for central banks in the world to step in to stabilise financial conditions. However, compared to before the crisis, financial conditions are still tighter now. The stock markets are lower and the average sovereign yield for euro area Member States is higher than before the shock. And these tighter financing conditions would be passed on to firms and households. To address this we took the decision to expand the PEPP last week. We assessed those conditions and we decided we had to do more. In the initial phase of the PEPP, market stabilisation was particularly important. Now, we want to make sure that stability stays but also that financial conditions are sufficiently accommodative to support the economic recovery and counter the substantial negative shock to the inflation trajectory.   In just less than three months, the PEPP has become bigger and longer, from €750 billion to €1,350 billion and extended from December 2020 to June 2021. But now we have two purchase programmes running: the APP and the PEPP. What is the difference between these two programmes; why do we need two?  Before the pandemic, the ECB had been on a sustained mission since 2015 to strengthen inflation and to bring it closer to the Governing Council’s inflation aim. To this end, we were using a package of instruments: the asset purchase programme (APP), the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) programme, the level of our key policy rates and forward guidance. Then the pandemic arrived, and our projections indicate that this shock is having a significant negative impact on inflation. As regards the role of the APP and the PEPP, we can draw a clear distinction: in the background, we have the traditional suite of policy instruments. But to deal with the unique and severe pandemic shock, we needed an additional and temporary tool. So it made sense to have two purchase programmes, the “traditional” APP and the pandemic programme. The PEPP is here to make sure the downside shock from the pandemic is addressed. However, even after the coronavirus crisis phase is over, inflation will still be far from our inflation aim, so the APP will still be needed. By the way, the horizon of the APP is open-ended in a state-contingent fashion; the horizon for APP asset purchases is conditional on the ECB’s Governing Council seeing a robust convergence of inflation to our aim.   The PEPP is “more temporary” than the APP. Yet the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the PEPP will be reinvested until at least the end of 2022. So it looks like a very long temporary period of time…  At our meeting last week, we extended the horizon of net purchases under the PEPP to June 2021, although in any case we will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until we judge that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. The June 2021 horizon broadly aligns the PEPP net purchase horizon with the horizons of our other monetary policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, such as our targeted lending programmes and collateral measures. As regards the reinvestment of maturing principals under the PEPP, we indeed announced that we would make reinvestments until at least the end of 2022. We want to make sure that the reinvestment strategy avoids the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions at a time when the recovery from the pandemic shock remains incomplete. It is also important that the management of the wind-down phase will not interfere with the ongoing conduct of monetary policy. At the same time, it is appropriate that the reinvestment strategy for the PEPP reflects its temporary nature and link to the pandemic emergency. The end of 2022 is a reasonable guide to the horizon for this, also as this horizon coincides with that of our macroeconomic projections.   The temporary nature of the PEPP is clear, but not so clear on reinvestments. The reinvestments of the APP, a programme that started in March 2015, are still going on. In Italy there is a widespread wishful thinking that ECB reinvestments will go on forever, becoming a proxy of debt monetisation, even if the ECB cannot finance governments directly.  The interest rates needed for the world economy are much lower now than they were 25 years ago. This is not unique to the ECB or the euro area. The reason why interest rates are so low has to do with many factors, such as demography and productivity, among others. Right now these forces are putting downward pressure on inflation. Central banks globally are fighting against low inflation and are engaged in asset purchases to do that. But our central bank actions are motivated by our monetary policy mandate: if the inflation outlook changes, then central bank policies will adjust as well. We do not know where interest rates will be in the future because we do not know where inflation will be in the next three, five or ten years. The advocates of debt monetisation claim that central banks will keep public debt no matter what. This is not the case. And anyway, the Treaty does not allow us to undertake debt monetisation.  You refer to a world of very low interest rates. TLTRO III goes as low as -1%. But does this mean that an interest rate cut is off the table now?   Our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, is at -0.5%. For banks participating in our targeted lending programme that lend sufficiently, the TLTRO III operations offer a rate as low as -1%: this provides an incentive to banks to keep the flow of credit to firms and households going. When it comes to our policy rate, we are ready to adjust it if necessary, as is true for all our instruments. We made our last cut of the policy rate in September of last year. In the current environment of exceptional uncertainty and remaining stress in financial markets, asset purchases within the PEPP have proven a particularly effective tool, so we focused on these in our most recent decision.   Are you satisfied with TLTROs and more lending with pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations and bridge longer-term refinancing operations to avoid a credit crunch?  We have learnt a lot from previous crises. An important part of our lending programmes is to incentivise banks to lend to households and firms. This is especially important when risks go up and the revenues of firms are hit. We have also revised our collateral framework: we expanded the set of eligible collateral against which banks can borrow from the ECB. This allows banks to lend more to the real economy. As a modern central bank, we recognise how important it is for households and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe to obtain credit. And our decisions in March and April addressed this: the highly attractive pricing of TLTRO III will run until next year. We are determined to make sure that this crisis is not made worse by an avoidable credit crunch.  Liquidity is there for sure, but does it go to SMEs or does it inflate financial bubbles?  What we have seen in the last weeks is a restoration of investor confidence in the European economy. Back in the middle of March, global investors were asking themselves whether European policymakers would respond appropriately to the shock. Would the ECB response be enough? How would the European institutions respond to the pandemic? Would there be enough solidarity? At the ECB, we have responded decisively, not only with our monetary policy but also through supervisory measures. Moreover, the response by national governments and at European level has also been centre stage. I think now, with all the various instruments in place, global investors have improved their opinion of the European response. So one thing we see in financial markets is more optimism about the prospects of the euro area economy.  At the beginning of the pandemic, did you perceive the return of the euro break-up fear like we had during the sovereign debt crisis back in 2010-12?  This is a very large shock. And we have seen that a crisis environment can give rise to self-fulfilling flight-to-safety dynamics and illiquidity in individual sovereign bond markets. But our monetary policy response has been effective in countering this, and the response of national governments and through European initiatives has addressed any underlying concerns. The European institutional framework is stronger than it was in 2010. And we also do not have now the imbalances in the euro area that we had in the last crisis.   Yes, many new tools have been created to fight the pandemic: the European Stability Mechanism pandemic support, SURE, the recovery facility, PEPP. But how do fiscal and monetary policies stay together? Any risk of overlapping?  Under current circumstances, this big negative economic shock is putting downward pressure on inflation. So, around the world we have seen simultaneous and ambitious policy actions by governments and central banks, including central bank purchases of government bonds. Monetary policies and fiscal policies are working in the same direction when these face a huge shock.  The German Constitutional Court raised an issue on the risk that the ECB’s monetary policy would get into the domain of fiscal policy…  The mandate conferred on us by the Treaty to maintain price stability is unambiguous and we are undeterred in the pursuit of this mandate, as President Lagarde has said. As a European institution we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and the Court ruled in 2018 that the public sector purchase programme is legal and in line with our mandate.

2020-06-09,Isabel Schnabel,Q&A on Twitter,"Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 9 June 2020","   INTERVIEW 9 June 2020  Q&A on Twitter   Interview on Twitter with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 9 June 2020 Good afternoon, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member @ecb. I’m here to answer your questions for the next 45 minutes. Please use #AskECB to join the conversation.  Why do you continue to use and expand QE, given that it has been a massive contributer to wealth inequality over the past decade?  Schnabel: Empirical evidence does not support this statement. #QE has even slightly reduced wealth inequality in the euro area, see https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2190.en.pdf #AskECB   #AskECB  if your inflation goal overshoots and we have a inflation of about 3% or more. Will you increase interest rates and stop QE? What would be the consequences for italy and indebted companies?  Schnabel: We counter too high as well as too low inflation in a symmetric way. By focusing on the medium term, we can adjust the speed of returning to our inflation aim, thereby mitigating the side effects of our measures, including on member states, firms and households. #AskECB   #AskECB : why is the  @ecb  holding so much gold?   Schnabel: The Eurosystem currently holds around 9% of its balance sheet in the form of gold and gold receivables: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/wfs/2020/html/ecb.fst200602.en.html. Gold is an important foreign reserve asset that is held for liquidity and risk diversification purposes. #AskECB   Do purchase programmes, especially those that essentially target spreads (like the PSPP envelope or PEPP), delay or prevent economic reforms in member states, especially in low growth/high debt states? If not, why?  #AskECB  Schnabel: There is no evidence that our purchase programmes have delayed economic reforms. In the COVID-19 crisis, fiscal & monetary policy are complementary. Our policies support reform efforts through their beneficial effect on funding costs. #AskECB   Why are you allowing zombie companies to survive ? They are not productive and suppress long term growth, aren’t they?  Schnabel: Our policies primarily support healthy and promising firms. The share of unviable firms has declined in many countries. Bank health matters more for firm quality than monetary policy, see https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2240~61e2d9dfec.en.pdf. #AskECB   #AskECB  Could you discuss whether changes to the dual rate system of TLTROs & Deposit Tiering could become the primary policy tool while the Deposit Facility Rate remains negative?  Schnabel: The negative deposit facility rate lowers funding costs for the whole economy. Offering more attractive conditions in TLTROs is an effective way to foster bank lending to households and firms. The tiering system reduces side effects on bank profitability. #AskECB   Christine Lagarde talked about being ahead of the curve with stable coins. Can you expand on what that means and looks like in practice?  Schnabel: We proactively monitor current developments in the area of stablecoins, assessing regulatory and financial stability implications: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202005_1~3e9ac10eb1.en.html. At the same time, we are open to innovation, including in the area of digital currencies. #AskECB   Are you discussing measures to enable deep neative rates at the board (eg the suggestion of Agarwal/Kimball) and what is your view on deep negativ rates as an alternative to QE?  #AskECB  Schnabel: Currently, we consider asset purchases to be a more effective and efficient tool, also taking potential side effects into account. But our experience with negative interest rates has been positive, and lowering interest rates remains an option for the future. #AskECB   #AskECB  What kind of data would make you reconsider the fact that QE actually boosts inflation instead of the opposite?  Schnabel: This question has to be analysed by comparing actual inflation with a counterfactual situation without QE. Based on empirical data, our analyses show that the effect of QE on inflation has been positive, see https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2346~dd78042370.en.pdf #AskECB   “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” How is the ECB’s power limited - and by whom? (I assume we can agree that the soft reporting requirements towards the EU parliament do not suffice as answer.) Thank you.   Schnabel: We have a clear mandate – price stability –, which is laid down in the Treaties. We are subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. And don’t underestimate our accountability towards the European Parliament, which is actually quite important. #AskECB   Everyone knows that most of the money is not coming to the consumers. Instead the biggest part end up at the markets where the bubbles are growing even bigger. So is there a real plan to do something for the economy or are all your actions only for making the rich even richer ?   Schnabel: I beg to differ. Our measures have been beneficial for consumers as they contributed to higher wages and created jobs. Income inequality has even decreased, as poorer households have benefited more from the positive employment effects. #AskECB   How are you ever going to normalise or will you just keep digging deeper and deeper until it all comes crashing down?!?  #AskECB  Schnabel: Our monetary policy actions are guided by our price stability mandate. We will adjust our measures when medium-term inflation recovers in a sustainable way, always taking into account the risks to financial stability and other potential side effects. #AskECB   Why ECB uses debt financing instead of monetary financing for covid recovery? Article 123.1of TFEU can be temporarily suspended to allow monetary financing and to avoid austerity in the future. It is not possible to repay debts, because the money to pay interests is never issued.  Schnabel: The prohibition of monetary financing is a cornerstone of our monetary system that ensures monetary stability. The ECB’s policies support economic growth and employment by providing favourable funding conditions throughout the euro area. #AskECB   #AskECB  Dear  @Isabel_Schnabel , as the  @ecb  assessed the climate impact of its  #COVID  response and operations in general? What are the  @ecb  plans to integrate climate, before and during the strategic review?   Unfortunately time is at the essence…  Schnabel: Climate protection is a key topic in our monetary policy strategy review, which will be resumed shortly. We will analyse the role of climate change for our economic models, investment portfolios, risk assessments and monetary policy operations. #AskECB   Hi  @Isabel_Schnabel  we had a  question  for you the other day about the exact guidance given to NCBs by the ECB executive board for the asset purchases (in term of maturity, etc.)  #AskECB  thanks!  Schnabel: In #PEPP national central banks receive guidance about the amounts to be purchased, guided by the capital key but with flexibility. With respect to maturities, purchases are guided by market neutrality. Therefore they also depend on issuance behaviour. #AskECB   During the COVID crisis, the ECB has allowed banks to use their own internal rating models for certain assets in order to obtain liquidity from the ECB. Don't you think it's against Governance that customers mark the quality of their own assets for external purposes?  #AskECB  Schnabel: Internal models are a well-accepted tool in banking supervision. To mitigate incentive problems, supervisors carefully check these models. The acceptance of internal ratings is a temporary measure to relieve the strains from the COVID-19 pandemic. #AskECB   Why is inflation so important to you?  Schnabel: What is important to me is price stability. Both too high and too low inflation can lead to high costs for society. That’s why we are mandated by the Treaty to keep prices stable. In recent years, inflation has been too low and is projected to fall even further. #AskECB   How long before cash is banned to enable interest rates to go deep into negative?  Schnabel: Cash continues to be very popular in the euro area, with some differences across member states. We are always ready to explore innovations like digital currencies, but there is no intention to abandon cash. #AskECB   How do you think about national ACC's, which lead to a renationalisation of monetary policy, might be used as an instrument of national economic policy to ease banks's lcr fulfillment and hence might lead to a race to the bottom in collateral acceptance?  #AskECB  Schnabel: The expansion of the ACC framework is a temporary response to the pandemic, which allows banks to make full use of our liquidity operations, so they can continue lending to the real economy. See our recent blog post on collateral https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2020/html/ecb.blog200422~244d933f86.en.html #AskECB   What is your view about the possibility of the monetary policy regime adjustment towards the history-dependent regimes (i.e. PLT, AIT, etc)? Or what do you see as the biggest challenges for such a change?  #AskECB  Schnabel: The advantages and disadvantages of price level targeting and average inflation targeting are going to be considered in the context of our monetary policy strategy review. As President Lagarde said: “We will not leave any stone unturned.” #AskECB   Is there a limit to which the ECB’s asset purchases can deviate from the capital key? If so, what is it? Thank you  #AskECB  Schnabel: Our public sector asset purchases are guided by the capital key. Our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) offers the flexibility to deviate from the capital key as required to ensure a smooth transmission of our monetary policy to the entire euro area. #AskECB   #AskECB  What methods does the ECB employ to ensure intellectual diversity in monetary thinking?  Schnabel: Our staff is intellectually and culturally diverse, and we encourage open discussions within the institution. Broad external interaction with economists with diverse backgrounds ensures full exposure to different streams of monetary thinking. #AskECB   What would you consider as a 'success' in terms of TLTRO-III take-up next week?  @Isabel_Schnabel   #AskECB  Schnabel: Given the favourable pricing, we expect a sizeable take-up next week (allotment on Thursday, 18 June). The TLTROs are successful if banks use the funds to grant loans to the real economy. #AskECB   Don't you think that the ECB needs a different and probably wider mandate from the European Parliament in order to cope with the expected and unexpected in the next decade? I guess you might be unwilling to answer this question because it is wholly political.  #AskECB  Schnabel: This is indeed a political question. Note, however, that our mandate already includes aspects like full employment and the protection of the environment, as long as these do not stand in conflict with our primary objective of price stability. #AskECB   Warum spricht Frau Schnabel nicht mit den Bürgern, wenn man fragen zur aktuellen Euro Politik hat?  Schnabel: Aber genau das mache ich doch gerade. Mir ist die Kommunikation mit den europäischen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern sehr wichtig. [But this is exactly what I am doing. Communication with the European citizens is very important to me.] #AskECB   A question related to the HICP (HVPI). Why do you add certain products to the HICP, which does not reflect the real inflation rate? Instead you reject goods with big price increases. In my opinion you are manipulating the inflation rate in the way you want it to be.  Schnabel: This claim is not correct. The HICP used by @ecb is calculated by @EU_Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Some prices like food have increased more strongly recently, which can give the impression that prices rise faster than they do. #AskECB   The PEPP Program will have an volume of €1.35 Billion. Two questions:   1. Where does the money for PEPP come from?    2. With @Lagarde the ECB wants to be more transparent. Why is it than a secret what the PEPP is buying? Please share iwith us.    3. What’s the exit plan?  #AskECB Schnabel: On question 2: Transparency and open communication are important strategic priorities for the @ecb. #PEPP purchases are not a secret. We publish granular information on these purchases on a bimonthly basis, most recently in early June: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/pepp/html/index.en.html #AskECB   it still makes sense today that the ECB’s main task is price stability?  #AskECB  Schnabel: Absolutely. Keeping prices stable preserves the purchasing power of European citizens and supports investment and job creation by reducing uncertainty. This is particularly important in the current crisis. #AskECB   #AskECB  2 related Q's, if you kindly will.    How would you explain the fact that centrals, here or abroad, continually conjure preposterous amounts of fiat currency without triggering significant inflation? Has ECB identified the cause of failure?  Schnabel: Monetary policy has raised inflation. But structural factors like globalisation, lower growth in energy prices and changes in competition weigh on inflation, requiring central banks to be more patient, as argued in a recent speech: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200227_2~301776ff2a.en.html. #AskECB   When assets are bought by the ECB. Do they yield the same interest income for the ECB? Why don't You report those earnings in the ECB meetings?  Schnabel: The ECB receives interest income on its asset holdings. Profits are distributed to the national central banks of the euro area, which are the ECB’s shareholders. The profits are reported in the annual accounts: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/annual/annual-accounts/html/index.en.html. #AskECB   ECB is the biggest buyer and holder of italien bonds. Soon the ECB will own everything.    How shall Italy ever pay those debts back? Why don’t write off all the debts of Greece, Italy...? Debt jubilee    Is this the end goal?  #AskECB  Schnabel: Our purchases are conducted in a way that maintains market functioning. This excludes holding everything. The prohibition of monetary financing is and will remain an important basis of monetary policy in the euro area. #AskECB   #AskECB  Given that there are comparisons of the current crisis with the 2008/09 crisis and predict a ""second wave"" of economic pressure. Even though these crises are not fully comparable, there is a noteable probability for a second wave of CoViD-19. How can the ECB react again?  Schnabel: Our decisions since March 2020 have provided important support to the real economy. Should conditions deteriorate, we have the necessary tools at our disposal to react to any contingency, as we have done since the start of the crisis. #AskECB   #AskECB  What effect do ECB policies have on asset prices? Do young people hold a lot of assets? Did young people with some access to capital found most modern tech companies? What policies could you implement to help young people in the tech industry to flourish in Eurozone?  Schnabel: An easing of monetary policy tends to raise asset prices, which lowers the costs of funding, including for equity. Especially start-up firms rely on functioning capital markets. The ECB is promoting the development of a European Capital Markets Union. #AskECB   #AskECB  target inflation 2% is right in 2020?  Schnabel: The @ecb’s inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% has served us well for the past 20 years. In our monetary policy strategy review, we will assess whether it remains appropriate for the future: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/search/review/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Stop this irresponsible policy. How will you ever normalize??? What is your plan B ? No risk management. This is like the 20s. The ECB ruins the financial system  Schnabel: As all major central banks, we have responded to this unprecedented crisis by expanding our balance sheet. Further monetary policy decisions will be guided by our mandate of price stability. The @ecb will stop purchases when appropriate. #AskECB   If the COVID19 triggered the economic depression, and many young people lost their work, what would be listed in the ECB’s agenda? #AskECB  Schnabel: The current crisis will lead to an increase in unemployment. Those who are at risk of losing their jobs are likely to benefit most from our measures. This includes many young people. #AskECB   Don't you fear a liquidity trap in Eurozone as it has been occurring in Japan?  #AskECB  Schnabel: No. We have ample evidence that our measures are effective in easing financing conditions in the economy. Our measures have supported economic growth and inflation.  #AskECB   Do the negative rates apply to total reserves or those in excess of the minimum reserves-to-deposits ratio?  #AskECB  Schnabel: To support policy transmission, we have introduced a two-tier system. This means that a multiple of banks’ minimum reserves are remunerated at the main refinancing rate (0%); the remaining excess reserves are remunerated at the deposit facility rate (-0.5%). #AskECB   #AskECB  Would be interested to learn whether your stance on buying green bonds changed? Would you still caution against it? Thank you.  Schnabel: The Eurosystem holds close to 20% of the green bonds eligible for our corporate bond purchase programmes. Our purchases have lowered yields and supported issuance. The more green bonds are issued, the more we can buy. #AskECB   According to the  @ecb  prices are currently rising to slow. There seems to be divergent views among the public and central banks regarding price inflation. How do you think the average person benefits, if their purchasing power falls at an even faster rate than currently?  Schnabel: Inflation is well below our aim of below, but close to, 2% and is expected to fall further due to COVID-19. Stable prices are crucial for the economy. Deflation would harm European citizens, including through lower wages and higher unemployment. #AskECB  Time to wrap up. Thanks a lot for your questions – I really enjoyed the chat and look forward to doing it again soon. Take care! @Isabel_Schnabel #AskECB    "
2020-06-06,Fabio Panetta,Intervista con News Mediaset,"Intervista con Fabio Panetta, membro del Comitato Esecutivo della BCE, condotta da Leonardo Panetta il 5 giugno 2020","   INTERVISTA 5 giugno 2020  Intervista con News Mediaset   Intervista con Fabio Panetta, membro del Comitato Esecutivo della BCE, condotta da Leonardo Panetta il 5 giugno 2020  Dottor Fabio Panetta, lei è uno dei sei componenti del Comitato Esecutivo della Bce. Avete deciso di potenziare ulteriormente il piano pandemico di acquisto titoli PEPP di 600 miliardi che, sommati ai 750 già stanziati a marzo, portano il totale a 1350. Buona la risposta di mercati e spread. Perché?  I nostri interventi ripetuti hanno chiarito ai mercati, agli investitori che noi saremo presenti, che noi faremo tutto il nostro dovere per garantire la stabilità dei prezzi, per garantire il finanziamento dell’economia in una fase molto difficile. La Bce già da marzo ha effettuato degli interventi ripetuti per sostenere l’economia, per garantire l’afflusso di finanziamenti alle famiglie e alle imprese e per evitare che l’economia europea e l’economia italiana all’interno dell’economia europea fossero colpite da una sorta di asfissia finanziaria.  L’Italia è uno dei paesi più colpiti dalla crisi innescata dal corona virus. Quali sono le prospettive per il nostro paese?  L’Italia seguirà la sorte dell’economia europea, una caduta dell’attività economica nel 2020 che è stata quantificata dal Governatore della Banca d’Italia tra il 9 e il 13% e una ripresa nel 2021 – 2022, sapendo però che con tutta probabilità la ripresa nell’anno prossimo e quello successivo non sarà in grado di compensare la caduta dell’attività economica nel 2020. L’Italia è stata più colpita perché la pandemia ha colpito il nostro paese più che altri. Come uscirne? Bene, dopo avere mantenuto in vita l’economia, dopo aver preservato la capacità produttiva del nostro paese con le misure di intervento straordinarie a livello italiano e a livello europeo, in larga parte dalla Bce, bisogna riprendere un’attività di reinvestimento, di risanamento, di riforme che possano potenziare la capacità competitiva dell’Italia.  Gli sforzi della Bce si aggiungono agli altri strumenti economici messi a punto dall’Unione europea. Il Fondo Sure per l’occupazione, un maggiore intervento della Bei, il Mes, e infine il Recovery Fund, sul quale però manca ancora un accordo tra paesi. Come giudica questo pacchetto?  Sono strumenti utili per sostenere l’occupazione, le imprese, per sostenere le spese in campo sanitario. L’Italia è stata parte di queste negoziazioni. Credo che le condizioni a cui i finanziamenti del Fondo Sure, della Bei e del Mes sono concessi, sono condizioni che tengono conto dell’esperienza della crisi di dieci anni fa, ovvero della necessità in fase di rallentamento, di difficoltà dell’economia, di non tarpare ulteriormente le ali alla crescita ma di fornire uno stimolo. Il fondo per la ricostruzione proposto dalla Commissione Europea è molto importante. Io credo che la proposta effettuata dalla Commissione sia un ottimo, un utilissimo passo in avanti. Rende evidente la consapevolezza di dovere agire anche a livello europeo per uscire da questa crisi così profonda.   "
2020-06-05,Fabio Panetta,"Interview with Radio anch’io, Rai Radio 1 ","Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Giorgio Zanchini on 5 June 2020","   INTERVIEW 5 June 2020  Interview with Radio anch’io, Rai Radio 1    Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Giorgio Zanchini on 5 June 2020  My first question is partly taken from the front page of Corriere della Sera, and that is: is the ECB worried about recession, and is that what triggered yesterday’s decision?   Yesterday’s decision was triggered by the tensions that we are experiencing in the euro area economy. At yesterday’s meeting, we discussed the new projections for growth and inflation. We have seen that the prolonged lockdown of economic activity has hit many euro area countries very hard and has caused deflationary pressures to resurface. Inflation is very low and is expected to remain so over the entire horizon covered by our projections (that is, the next two years). We acted in accordance with the ECB’s mandate to ensure price stability at the European level, and expanded our programme for purchasing securities.  Mr Panetta, what are the projections for the euro area for the next two years?  Every three months, the ECB publishes its projections for growth and inflation in the euro area over the following two years. Yesterday we published the projections for June and, as was to be expected, they were much worse than the previous set of projections. The outlook for growth for this year, 2020, has fallen by almost 10 percentage points, which is huge. Before the pandemic, growth was projected to be just below 1%, and now we are looking at a contraction of more than 8.5%. So, this difference between 1% in the pre-crisis projections and a recession of around 8.5% – that’s the effect of the pandemic, that’s the coronavirus effect. We expect to see an improvement in 2021 and 2022, but this will only go some way towards mitigating the effects; it will not make up for all of the fall in economic activity this year.  And what about Italy, Mr Panetta?  We don’t publish projections for individual countries, but Italy will clearly follow a similar path. The Governor of the Banca d’Italia gave some data in his recent Concluding Remarks. According to the latest estimates, the Italian economy is expected to contract by between 9% and 13%. Of course, these estimates are surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, because economic developments in the coming months will probably not be dictated by the laws of economics, but very probably by variables that are much less well known. Will there be a new wave of infections? Will there be a vaccine? Will there need to be another lockdown phase or social distancing measures? We don’t have the answers to these questions, and there is clearly a very close relationship between the measures to contain the pandemic and economic developments. However, the Italian economy will follow a similar path to that of the European economy, with a very strong fall in economic activity this year and partial recovery in the following years.  One last question: this is an excellent parachute – I’m using a term from one of today’s newspapers – for our public debt, among other things, sales of bonds have been excellent. Some are now asking whether all the instruments being made available by the European authorities – and I’ll try to list the main ones without making a mistake: the SURE programme, the EIB, the Recovery Fund – are they not making the ESM, for example, useless? I understand that it’s not your role to answer. But do we really need all of these financing measures if in reality there is this safety net, this parachute of yours?  Well, the market conditions we observe depend on the information investors have at their disposal. Investors know that this is a very large purchase programme implemented by the ECB to finance the economy, keep a lid on borrowing costs and provide liquidity. They also know that these are measures that have been taken and that others are being discussed by the European authorities. It would be a mistake for people to believe – after the fact, and seeing that conditions are relatively positive and calm – that this situation is entirely unrelated to the steps that have been taken beforehand. What we see on the markets, the degree of optimism – or reduced pessimism – and the greater sense of calm that is a result of all the decisions taken by national and European authorities. It would be wrong to think that these measures are useless.  So, you detect a note of relative optimism?  Compared to a few weeks ago, there is no doubt about it. It has become clear that, first of all, the ECB will take action, it will do so in a decisive way, and it will not allow a tightening of financial conditions to further weigh on the euro area economy. Second, even though the situation has been somewhat challenging at times, it has become clear that the authorities at European and national level are taking action. They are taking decisive steps relatively quickly. The ECB has acted with maximum speed. We decided yesterday to extend our purchase programme. In a few days’ time, our purchases will already have been expanded. The European authorities are discussing sizeable measures in a time frame which up until only a few weeks ago would have been unthinkable.   "
2020-06-05,Christine Lagarde,Interview with France 2,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Léa Salamé and Thomas Sotto on 4 June 2020","   INTERVIEW 5 June 2020  Interview with France 2   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Léa Salamé and Thomas Sotto on 4 June 2020  Good evening Madame Lagarde. Thank you for agreeing to share some of your scarce speaking time with us. This afternoon you published terrible growth projections for the euro area: -8.7% in 2020. In France, we are looking at a recession with the economy shrinking by 11%. How can we stay optimistic when we see such catastrophic figures?  We remain optimistic because we know that we are currently going through the worst phase of the crisis. Economies have just been hit by a huge shock, the likes of which we have never seen before in peacetime; a shock from a pandemic that has hit every country in the world, one after the other, and that has slowed, even totally stalled, some economies. But for several days now – or several weeks in some countries – we have been seeing the lockdown measures steadily lifted, and activity is gradually picking up again. We were at the lowest point of the curve and we are carefully going back up. Clearly, the extent to which the situation improves will depend on how quickly we can pick ourselves back up and on the collective efforts we are all capable of making. A second reason to be hopeful: yes, our projections for this year are bleak, with growth of -8.7%, so negative growth for the whole of 2020. But we will return to positive growth in 2021, and it is very likely that by the end of 2022 our economies will have returned to where they were when this catastrophic crisis hit, sparked by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. So we were at our lowest point, but now we’re starting to pick ourselves back up and we will return to positive growth next year. This is clearly a very challenging time that requires every effort to be made. We have to do everything we can to revive confidence. Here at the European Central Bank we have to ensure that credit continues to flow, that investments can be made and that consumption picks up. Every effort must be made and every institution must be mobilised, at the national level, at the regional level and, of course, at the European level.  In an attempt to resurface, the ECB has decided to inject a further €600 billion through its emergency programme to support the economy. In total, that’s €1.35 trillion. These are astronomical, dizzying figures; it’s very hard to grasp their concrete value. What effect will all this money have on our lives?  The programme you are talking about is designed to purchase private and public sector securities. Why are we doing that? We are doing that to put downward pressure on interest rates. Mechanically, our actions are transmitted along the entire chain of financial products and loans extended to businesses and households. If the ECB lowers the interest rates that countries have to pay to borrow, this has a mechanical effect that also lowers the rates offered to businesses and households. So when you buy a car, or take out a consumer loan, or purchase real estate, the bank, the financial institution that is giving you that loan, can do so at exceptionally attractive and low interest rates. And this is because the ECB and all the national central banks of the euro area are putting downward pressure on interest rates.  The debt levels of euro area countries have exploded overnight! We’re talking about 115% of GDP in France – this is unprecedented. Will this money have to be repaid? And if so, when? In 10 years? 50? 100? Is repaying this money going to strangle the economy?  Allow me to make two extremely important points. First, borrowing was the only way to handle the budgetary expenditure. In other words, for countries to be able to protect their economies, they definitely had to inject public money. When every private actor has ceased their activities, public money has to be injected to support the economy. Everywhere in the world, and of course in the euro area as well, every country has had to borrow to finance their public spending. There were no other options. And my second point: interest rates are especially low at the moment. Currently, when euro area governments borrow money, most of them do so at rates close to zero, and some are even borrowing at negative rates. Debt servicing – which is what is most relevant for annual budgets – is being conducted at especially low rates. The correct response was for countries to commit to supporting their economies. So what does it mean that the economy is now going to start to pick up in terms of consumption, in terms of investment? It means growth. And growth is clearly the best way to deal with these additional necessary debts because, with the relatively low costs of debt servicing at the moment, it enables them to be gradually repaid.  There was extensive criticism of Europe’s delayed response to the crisis, of national self-interest, of silence on the part of the European Commission. Even Jacques Delors himself spoke out and warned that Europe was in mortal danger. Isn’t there some truth to these criticisms? There was a delay in getting things under way, wasn’t there?   As you can imagine, I will of course defend my own shop! The ECB was ready to act at extremely short notice. As a point of comparison, during the global financial crisis we experienced in 2008, and subsequently the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011, we were on unfamiliar ground and it was our first time facing a crisis of this nature, so the European institutions took some time to launch new tools, they took some time to commit themselves. At the ECB we were genuinely very quick off the mark. We have been taking exceptional measures since 18 March – in fact, we started taking them on 5 March.  Then, on 18 March, we stepped up our action, and were truly very decisive in the support we gave to the economy. First, by providing a significant amount of liquidity because there was a serious liquidity crisis, and second, by ensuring that lending to firms continued at favourable conditions for all parties. Third, by seeking to fulfil our mandate and preserve price stability by exerting downward pressure on interest rates to stimulate lending for investment and consumption and thereby bringing about an economic recovery.   I don’t know if you read or listen to Michel Houellebecq, but in relation to this crisis he said that the world afterwards would be a worse version of the world before. It’s similar to Greenpeace’s criticism that the ECB has allocated more than €7.5 billion to polluting fossil fuels, and not enough to non-polluting, renewable energy sources. How would you respond to that? Doesn’t it send the wrong signal?  It’s a problem that is particularly close to my heart and which – even when I am criticised for it, both during my eight years at the IMF and now at the ECB – I think is deserving of special attention and should be a priority.  We have launched a strategy review, which we are going to resume now that the coronavirus has abated a little and restrictions are being eased. We will also “ease restrictions” on our strategy review and will get back to work on it wholeheartedly.  The fight against climate change and the protection of biodiversity will be crucial elements in our various courses of action. These have multiple dimensions; they go beyond asset purchases alone. In that regard, I do not entirely agree with the figures that were mentioned, by the way, but that’s not so important. The fact is that we have to take these elements into consideration as a matter of urgency. This will cause us to change the models used for our economic projections, to re-examine the body of what we call “collateral”, in other words the securities, the loans to firms, pledged by the banks as security for funding. We will need to ascertain whether those loans have been valued correctly, taking climate risk into account. It will also lead us to work, in our role as supervisor, on a “stress test” for banks that will incorporate the dimension of climate change. And it will very likely prompt us to use the fight against climate change as a parameter when calibrating our programmes for purchasing assets in the market – but it cannot be the sole parameter. It should be noted that we are already large purchasers of what are known as “green bonds”: we are very active buyers in that market. We hold almost 20% of all green bonds.   In a Tweet you said that what you missed most during this period was being able to see your grandson. Looking at him today, do you have any fears for him? Could you share your thoughts?   At the moment I only see him on my smartphone and in photographs, so it’s still a little sad… I would love to see him from closer by, as I would love to see all of my family. Looking at him makes me all the more convinced of the value of our mission, which is to work to make our society a better place, so that it will take up the fight against climate change, protect biodiversity, ensure that future growth is both fairer and more efficient. So yes, it does give me an even greater sense of responsibility.    "
2020-05-27,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Perspektiven der Wirtschaftspolitik,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Karen Horn","   INTERVIEW 27 May 2020  Interview with Perspektiven der Wirtschaftspolitik   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Karen Horn  In its ruling on the ECB’s public sector purchase programme (PSPP)[1] pronounced on 5 May, the German Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe found that these asset purchases were partly unconstitutional and that the European Court of Justice (ECJ), in assessing the programme’s proportionality, had failed to satisfy the requirements of a comprehensible review of the ECB’s observance of its monetary policy mandate. What is your view on that and what are its consequences for the ECB?   The ruling is solely addressed to the German Federal Government and the Bundestag, which are now required to use their influence to bring about a proportionality assessment by the ECB of its asset purchases. That is problematic for two reasons: first, the ECJ, which has jurisdiction over the ECB, ruled that the PSPP was compatible with EU law. Second, under Article 130 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the ECB is an independent institution and does not follow the instructions of national authorities. The ECJ’s ruling remains definitive for us and there is therefore no necessity to change our monetary policy. It is good news that the new asset purchase programme – the pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP for short, which we launched in response to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic – is not affected by the Karlsruhe ruling. Market developments show that, despite initial uncertainty, market participants share this perception. So we will continue to do what is necessary to fulfil our price stability mandate and ensure transmission of the common monetary policy across the whole euro area. At the same time, what happens in Germany, the largest country in the euro area, is of course important for us.   The Deutsche Bundesbank is more directly affected than the ECB; if the set deadline is not met, it must ensure that the government bonds already purchased under the PSPP are sold on the basis of a – possibly long-term – coordinated strategy.   Yes, the ruling explicitly mentions a period of three months. Under the Constitutional Court ruling, if the proof of proportionality required by the Constitutional Court has not been provided within that time, the Bundesbank would no longer be able to participate in asset purchases under the PSPP. I am confident that such a situation can be avoided. It should be noted that when preparing, deciding on and implementing the PSPP and its other monetary policy measures, the ECB has always analysed their effects and side effects and weighed them up against each other. There are scores of documents in this regard, many of which, such as the accounts of the monetary policy meetings of the Governing Council, are publicly available. Such documents were provided to the ECJ by the ECB in the course of the legal proceedings and are sure to have been taken into consideration in the legal assessment.   But there is still no disclosure of the actual minutes.   We publish monetary policy accounts, which are slightly condensed versions of the minutes.[2] These accounts are very detailed. You can learn a great deal from them about the Governing Council’s discussions. They exemplify our transparent way of working and our commitment to consistently provide a sufficient explanation of our monetary policy measures. We are also accountable to the European Parliament, which holds regular hearings about monetary policy (referred to as the monetary policy dialogue). During these hearings, the ECB President answers questions on monetary policy from Members of the European Parliament. This exchange is broadcast live online and is recorded in published transcripts, which also goes to show that an assessment of the effects and side effects of our monetary policy decisions is made on a regular basis.   The assessment takes place, and it is feasible to present the documentation in a way that makes the assessment comprehensible for the courts. Does that mean that the ruling was exaggerated?  That’s not for me to judge. But the legal assumptions underlying the ruling reach beyond the actual case of the PSPP, because the main issue is the general relation between EU law and national law. The primacy of EU law is a fundamental principle of the European Union. It would be extremely important for the ECJ and the Constitutional Court to find a common understanding and work together cooperatively.   When the ruling was pronounced on 5 May, the newsreader of the German news programme “Heute Journal” said that it had to do with €2,600 billion in borrowings that the ECB had pumped into circulation in the years from 2014 to 2018, thereby depriving savers of their interest earnings. This narrative of the purported expropriation of savers, which the complainants carried forward and which the Constitutional Court partly adopted in its ruling, is evidently gaining ground. You’re surely not happy about that?   I’ve been concerned about the topic of false narratives about the ECB's monetary policy for a long time now. A central bank can obviously not make itself immune to criticism simply because it is independent. Quite the contrary. But I am concerned that, especially in Germany, these narratives of the expropriation of savers, punitive interest rates, a glut of liquidity, threatening inflation and zombie firms have developed and taken hold, despite numerous facts in support of another perspective. These narratives are repeatedly recycled by the media and therefore reinforced. We know that constant dripping wears away the stone. If people hear something often enough, there comes a point when they start to believe it. That was actually why in February I devoted my first major speech[3] in my new position to exactly this topic, interestingly in Karlsruhe of all places.   Not at the Constitutional Court, though, but at the Karlsruhe Legal Research Society.   Yes, there were even a number of federal judges in attendance but no one from the Constitutional Court. In my view, these narratives, which I attempted to refute in Karlsruhe, have found their way into the Constitutional Court’s ruling without being challenged. My speech was not just about me taking a different view. Together with ECB staff members, I made a concerted effort to go through each of the narratives in detail and draw on data and empirical research, and I demonstrated where the fallacies arose. One or two of the points may of course be open to debate, but we should use facts to rebut the arguments.   So where do the fallacies appear?   On many points, the evidence is quite overwhelming, so most of the narratives cannot be sustained. For a start, many people fail to understand why interest rates are so low. Contrary to the prevailing narrative, the low interest rates are not primarily caused by the central bank. Structural macroeconomic trends, such as demographics and the development of a society’s capacity to innovate, which affect macroeconomic investment and savings, are of far more importance. They determine what is known as the real equilibrium rate, which central banks have to be guided by. That is the rate that emerges when all factors of production are at full capacity and exert no inflationary pressure.  And these sources of growth have declined.   Exactly. The working-age population in the euro area is decreasing. And whereas in the 1980s annual productivity growth in the euro area still hovered around 2% on average, it is now slightly less than half of that. If the real equilibrium rate is very low or even negative, interest rate policy can bump against the effective zero lower bound. That is why central banks, including the ECB, generally turn to unconventional measures when short-term interest rates are at very low levels, especially as extremely low, and in part even negative, rates of inflation began to appear in the euro area as of 2014. Over the past few years, the package of monetary policy measures has considerably stimulated the euro area economy. The cost of credit for firms and households has declined markedly – and indeed to a greater extent than could have been expected solely from the lowering of the key interest rates. That revived the demand for loans, thereby supporting investment and the creation of new jobs. Without those measures, two million fewer people would have been in work in the euro area in 2019, while gross domestic product would have been between 2.5% and 3.0% lower.   In your speech in Karlsruhe you also pointed out that the narrative of the expropriation of German savers was faulty alone on the grounds that there is no entitlement to high interest rates on savings and because it is not part of the ECB’s mandate to ensure returns for savers.   Yes, and, first and foremost, some people tend to take an overly negative view of the effect of low interest rates and to overestimate it. The average real interest rate that has been earned on savings and demand deposits in Germany since the introduction of the euro is approximately the same as the equivalent average rate over the preceding 24 years. Moreover, Germany consists not only of savers, but also of borrowers, taxpayers, home owners and workers. Looking purely at the interest account for a representative German household over the period from 2007 to 2017, there is even a small plus on the bottom line. Precisely the middle income group, which is the group with the most borrowers, has benefited from the low interest rate policy.  And you don’t share the concern that low interest rates keep firms in operation that would have had to fold under normal circumstances?  This concern is not supported by empirical research. The data simply show no trace of a systematic increase in the number of unprofitable firms during the years of expansionary monetary policy. On the contrary, that number has actually declined. More favourable financing conditions benefit all firms, but most of all profitable, healthy firms, to whom banks are more willing to provide favourable loans than they are to unprofitable and highly indebted ones. So this narrative does not hold up either to a closer scrutiny of the economic interconnections and empirical research. But, at the end of the day, these substantive considerations may not be the key issue at all.   But rather?  Procedures presumably take centre stage. They can always be improved, thereby enhancing transparency for example. We indeed set great store on transparency: we already make every effort to more clearly explain what we do by posting short video clips, explainers and other such items on the ECB’s website or on Twitter. A stated objective of ECB President Christine Lagarde is to improve communication – not only with the financial markets, but also with European citizens. However, the great importance lent to these misleading narratives in practice shows us that central banks have evidently not yet succeeded in communicating directly and efficiently with the public. We need to do that in a much better way; the speech I gave in Karlsruhe was a first attempt to do so. In that respect, the Constitutional Court’s ruling has spurred us on: we want our monetary policy to be understood and, most of all, we want people to realise that we are doing something of benefit to them. But the story that is being told in Germany is the exact opposite: the ECB’s policies benefit other people, but definitely not the Germans. That is a dangerous misperception considering the extent to which Germany in particular has benefited from the euro. I want to try to correct that impression.   Against the backdrop of the ruling, isn’t it now, more than ever, time to say goodbye to the idea that the ECB can, as it were, fix everything? How strong is the other arm of economic policy, fiscal policy? What needs to be done for monetary and fiscal policy to work more in tandem?   Monetary policy is more effective if it is supported by a corresponding fiscal policy. I have the impression that this has been very well understood in the current crisis. Everyone appears to realise that with a shock as severe as the one we are currently experiencing, fiscal policy has to come into action and monetary policy cannot resolve the crisis on its own. But not all countries have the same options. Indeed, many of the countries that took a harder blow are precisely those that have less fiscal space available. That’s why there is a concern that too little is being done in these countries to overcome the crisis. Not only does that present a problem for developments in the countries concerned, it also has spillover effects throughout Europe. It could result in economic divergence among the Member States, which would impede the transmission of monetary policy to all parts of the euro area. Moreover, the EU Member States are so closely interconnected that weak developments in some Member States would also impair the others. So it’s imperative to act in a European spirit to resolve the crisis.   If Germany is doing well while other countries are doing badly, Germany suffers too.   Exactly. And so we now have to do all we can to prevent the crisis from further widening the existing divergence among Member States. That would present a major problem for monetary policy, but of course also for European integration and solidarity. That’s why the European initiatives are so important; they can help ensure that all Member States do what is necessary to overcome the crisis. We are now undergoing the most severe crisis since the Great Depression, and it can’t be ruled out that the overall outcome in some countries will eventually be even worse than at that time. On the one hand, that calls for solidarity. Within the EU, we must mutually support each other in this serious crisis. But on the other, also in the individual Member States’ own interests, it requires a European response.   However, the crisis is hitting the EU at the worst conceivable time. There is less harmony between Member States than before, the institutions in Brussels seem to be weakened, and the ECB not only has to contend with a court ruling from Karlsruhe, but also with the fact that its own toolkit has shrunk and it is reliant on unconventional monetary policies.   I don’t share that view. The ECB’s monetary policy response to the crisis was extremely swift and decisive, for one because we had learned a great deal from the previous crises, the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent euro debt crisis, and had already garnered experience in using new monetary policy instruments. We were able to very quickly adjust the toolkit to the current crisis and we rapidly understood the nature of the crisis we were dealing with. I wouldn’t underestimate that. On a national level, fiscal policy also swung quickly into action in many countries. Who would have thought it possible in Germany for this tremendous programme to be conjured up at such speed from thin air? Things are happening at European level too. The three core components of the support programme – the labour market programme SURE, the guarantee fund through the European Investment Bank and a special programme with limited conditionality under the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – have largely been finalised. The most recent Franco-German initiative to design the planned recovery fund is also very encouraging, and I am eagerly awaiting the European Commission’s forthcoming proposal. This fund is especially important as it will be geared to the future and will not only help countries to overcome the acute economic shock, but also to subsequently find their way back to a sustainable reform-oriented path. Such decisions always take a little longer in Europe because of the complex nature of our governance. But I warmly welcome the current developments, even if we have not yet reached our goal.   The ECB launched an initial package of measures on 12 March followed by a second large package on 18 March that centres on the PEPP referred to earlier. To what extent were these measures driven by events in Italy and the concern that Italy could run into difficulties that would result in a disaster for the whole euro area? Italy has indeed been a cause of concern since the financial crisis.   Italy was not our concern. Our monetary policy is geared to the whole euro area. There was severe financial market turbulence in the period from 12 March, the date of our first monetary policy package, to 18 March, when we announced the PEPP. Equity prices continued to fall, the spreads on risk premia for government bonds widened noticeably and market liquidity dried up. You could observe the financial market data deteriorating by the second. The ensuing risks to growth, employment and price developments were considerable. We therefore responded with a new programme that was precisely tailored to this situation. PEPP calmed the markets and contained fragmentation in the euro area. You can see from many time series that a trend reversal set in exactly at the moment the ECB launched its PEPP package.   So are you satisfied with developments since then?   We succeeded in stabilising the financial markets, in cooperation with the other major central banks. All came into action at virtually the same time. Fiscal policymakers also took steps. However, the financing conditions for firms and banks are still more unfavourable than they were before the crisis. We still have higher risk premia in many segments. It would not be true to claim that we are now in a relaxed situation. That is not least a reflection of the consequences of the crisis for the real economy. The effects will be deeper and longer-lasting than originally anticipated. And the world will be a different one. At present, when drawing up economic projections we think in scenarios because the uncertainty is so large. But compared with the escalation that we saw in mid-March, the situation has calmed down markedly and the ECB’s monetary policy obviously contributed to this.   There was an intense debate as to whether it would not have been better to use the ESM and to activate the programme of   Outright Monetary Transactions    (OMTs) – even if only because going through the ESM would have ensured at least partial democratic control. What do you see as the decisive difference, and what is the relative advantage of the solution that was chosen instead?   The OMT programme was developed against the backdrop of the specific crisis situation in 2012. It was intended for a situation in which, in one or more Member States, self-fulfilling and self-reinforcing market dynamics arise that are beyond their control, putting the state concerned under fiscal pressure, even though it is still solvent and could continue to access market funding. This could be observed during the euro debt crisis. That is why individual Member States were given loans through the European Financial Stability Facility and later through the ESM under conditions (referred to as conditionality) that seek to ensure that the states carry out structural reforms, flanked by monetary policy. However, the OMTs did not need to be used at the time because their announcement in itself was enough to stabilise the markets. Our current situation is a completely different one. The shock has hit all countries, out of the blue, through no fault of their own. We have no significant moral hazard issue and so the incentives that are attached to support are not a priority. Conditionality is not required in the same way. The Stability and Growth Pact has been put on hold for the moment and a programme with deliberately weaker conditionality has been agreed on at the ESM. There’s a general understanding that this type of crisis is completely different from the euro debt crisis. For our monetary policy too, we therefore need other instruments. That is not to say that there might not be a situation in future in which the OMT is deployed – it is an important tool in our toolkit. But in our view, it is not the appropriate means for the current situation.   The ECB has taken other measures in addition to the PEPP, including relaxing collateral requirements in its credit operations. Now even Greek junk bonds can be accepted. Isn’t this a cause for concern? Aren’t you afraid that there will be a higher rate of default?  These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. And that applies also to the collateral framework. Our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), which haven’t been talked about as much as the asset purchase programmes, are an important instrument through which we offer banks very favourable financing conditions if they continue their lending activities. The idea here is that the favourable financing conditions are passed on to borrowers, be they firms or households, thereby cushioning the crisis. At the same time, incentives are in place to encourage continued lending. But all of our loans to banks have to be backed by adequate collateral. The package of measures taken by the ECB in relation to the collateral framework aims to ensure that banks have sufficient collateral at their disposal. It is true that this has involved increasing our risk tolerance, but our risk management system helps us to assess the complicated trade-off between the effectiveness of our measures and the associated risks. And we also need to bear in mind that there are different levels when it comes to collateral. For there to be a default, the bank would first have to fail to service the loan obtained from the ECB, and then the collateral would also have to fail. The default rates can be expected to be relatively low. We have always been extremely conservative, and now we’re a bit less conservative, but the overall level of protection remains very good. And the haircuts we apply ensure that the risk is adequately accounted for: if a bank deposits collateral worth €100, it doesn’t get €100 of funding, it gets somewhat less than that, with the amount depending on the quality of the underlying collateral.  But the size of the haircut was reduced in March.  Yes, that’s true, by 20%. We decided that, on balance, there was a good case to be made for this measure. And we continue to differentiate: if an asset becomes riskier, the haircut increases. That also applies to the assets that we continue to accept as collateral even when they fall below the minimum quality level as a result of the crisis.  While we’re on the subject of banks’ default risk, it’s fair to say that they have not yet fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008. How do you think the coronavirus crisis is likely to affect the stability of banks in the euro area?   The financial system cannot emerge unscathed from a crisis as severe as the one we are currently experiencing. And that’s why it is so important that the ECB, on the one hand, provides ample liquidity. There is always a concern that banks, particularly in times of crisis, will become very reluctant to lend and that this will exacerbate the crisis even further. The financial crisis taught us that this is to be avoided. That is exactly what the TLTROs are there for. At the same time, governments are guaranteeing loans to companies that have seen their earnings collapse in the crisis. This has reduced the default risk for banks. In addition, concessions have been made on the supervisory side. It is fortunate that we have managed to strengthen banks’ capital and liquidity in recent years – perhaps not yet sufficiently, as many believe, but at least to a notable degree. We are reaping the benefits of that now. The buffers that have been built up can now be used to prevent procyclical effects that would exacerbate the crisis. Whether the banks actually do so is, however, an open question. One could also ask whether it makes sense that aid is generally taking the form of loans, both to governments and firms. There is a risk of a debt overhang in the coming years.  What do you fear might be the consequences?   A debt overhang is dangerous because it can result in insufficient investment. The explanation for that is simple: if a company is heavily indebted, many investments are not worthwhile, because the returns go to the creditors in the first instance and too little stays within the company. If we allow a debt overhang to build up across the entire economy, it will be fatal for investment. We urgently need to think about what we can do to prevent this. Immediate thoughts turn to equity financing, where the problem does not exist to the same extent. In the case of stock corporations, preference shares could be considered. But that wouldn’t be an option for small and medium-sized companies that don’t issue stock. An international team of researchers led by Jan Krahnen has considered this kind of equity-based model.[4] Under this proposal, financial assistance provided to companies would be repaid in the form of corporate profit tax. Since taxes would only be paid by successful companies, the model would have an equity-like nature. There are questions to ask about how exactly such a scheme would be implemented, but the proposal goes broadly in the right direction. If there are too many loan defaults, that will hit the banks and destabilise the banking system. We absolutely must try to avoid a situation in which the current crisis is made even worse by a banking crisis. We have to look very carefully and draw on the lessons of previous crises which showed how important it is to react quickly and to recapitalise in good time. That said, I hope that won’t be necessary.  Mechanisms for recapitalising and resolving failing banks were put in place in the wake of the financial crisis. How well do you think they work? Will they help us now if things get tough?  That depends. In a research paper that I wrote at the University of Bonn, my two co-authors and I conducted an empirical analysis of the effects that a bank resolution framework has in the event of a severe shock, looking at whether such frameworks increase or decrease systemic risk in the banking sector.[5] We found that it is very dependent on whether the event is a system-wide shock or an isolated shock. The study shows that a system-wide shock is associated with higher systemic risk if a more comprehensive resolution framework is in place. In other words, a resolution framework, which is of course designed to stabilise the system, can in fact have a destabilising effect in the event of a systemic crisis. These findings have a certain relevance in the current situation, when we have to ask ourselves what would happen if several banks were now suddenly to get into trouble at the same time. Is it realistic that we would restructure or resolve several banks at the same time in the depths of a severe crisis? It’s hard enough in normal times. And at least then it has a stabilising effect. But in times of crisis it may have the opposite effect.   That’s not very reassuring.  There is certainly a need to consider how to approach this without causing permanent damage to the resolution framework. The idea of a systemic risk exception is a useful one – in other words, greater room for manoeuvre could be granted in a very strictly defined extreme situation. We are seeing this now in all sorts of areas, for example with the Stability and Growth Pact or the rules on state aid. Or take industrial policy. When Peter Altmaier, the German Minister for Economic Affairs, released a strategy paper just over a year ago, it caused quite a commotion. And now things will probably be done that go far beyond that.  That raises the question of an exit strategy.  Indeed, that’s a very important question. But it’s something to address in the second phase. Right now we need to look at certain things that we previously considered to be appropriate and at least question them. That shouldn’t mean burying them forever, but we do need to question whether, right now, in one of the worst crises there has ever been, they might in fact add fuel to the fire.   How far have we got with the banking union, which was supposed to make things safer? How well prepared are we in that respect for whatever may happen next?   The banking union is unfortunately not yet complete. Among many other things, there is still no European deposit insurance scheme and the privileges on banks’ sovereign exposures have not been removed. And we are now seeing growing fragmentation, not least as a result of the national guarantees that have been put in place. A bank’s solvency is increasingly dependent on the volume of guarantees available and the ability of the state issuing those guarantees to pay. So we are once again creating a direct link between the solvency of banks and of sovereigns, when one of the aims of banking union was to decouple them. In that sense, this crisis represents a backward step for the banking union in the first instance. But it also offers an opportunity, in that it underlines the need to push forward banking union and capital markets union to improve the resilience of the European financial system. We must also facilitate urgently needed structural change in the banking sector, through consolidation and cross-border mergers, to improve the profitability of banks.  There will be a lot to sort out afterwards.   The crucial question is how we manage in the end to go back to the old rules. Banking supervision, for example, is currently being very accommodative in many areas, and rightly so, but at some point we will need to make our way back to the old system. Otherwise there would be permanent damage. A great deal of work was done by many at the time to ensure that capital requirements were increased, that non-performing loans were classified as such in good time and that there was appropriate provisioning. At some point we will need to focus again on the old rules. It’s too soon to do so now, but that should still be the aim.   It’s too early now, but when will it be time?   With temporary measures, nobody knows exactly what the word “temporary” means. The time frame could turn out to be quite long. But we have to be clear that what matters right now is getting over the crisis and ensuring that the euro area doesn’t fall into a depression lasting many years, but that we get back on a path of steady growth next year and make up at least some of the losses suffered. That certainly looks likely at the moment.   There has been intense debate about whether there might after all be a need for Eurobonds. The Italian government in particular was very much in favour. In the meantime, other measures have been agreed in Brussels. Is that the end of the subject?   There will be repeated calls for Eurobonds and the topic will remain a controversial one, particularly when it comes to models involving joint liability. This is viewed with scepticism in some Member States, such as Germany and the Netherlands, which is understandable. The fundamental probem is that if liability is transferred to the European level, then the decision-making also needs to happen at the Europan level. But the proposal for a Europan recovery fund put forward by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron points in that direction. Whether there will be a regular form of European debt in the future will in the long term depend on whether there is a readiness to transfer further competences and tasks in the area of fiscal policy to the European level. There is a further dimension to this topic, which is that the euro area doesn’t have a truly European safe asset. That poses a problem for monetary policy. And if we want to strengthen the international role of the euro, it doesn’t help that the market is so fragmented, with all the various different bonds, the safest of which are considered to be German bonds. At some point we will need to find an answer to this question.   So, debt mutualisation after all?   That is one option, but it’s not the only one. There have been a number of interesting ideas about how a safe European asset could be created without debt mutualisation. That could also help to loosen the bank-sovereign nexus. A safe European asset would make a lot of things easier.  What would that kind of instrument look like?   Various aspects would need to be considered in its design, such as the impact on fiscal discipline and the functioning of national bond markets, including in the context of financial stability.[6] One option would be the ESBies proposed by Marcus Brunnermeier and his co-authors.[7] This concept is based on tranching, where government bonds are put into a basket and divided into different tranches. The safest tranche is then the safe asset. Another model involves so-called E-Bonds.[8] In this case, a package of bonds is secured by ensuring that these bonds are serviced before others. That could alter the pricing structure on the financial market and thus create significant incentives. The second model may well be more realistic. Some have ruled out the first, relatively complicated model, because there is a certain underlying scepticism about securitisation structures and tranching, and bad experiences were had with securitisation during the financial crisis, particularly in the United States. I think it is still worth having an open debate. Neither model involves debt mutualisation, and for that reason it’s perhaps not a bad idea to look at them both again.   Finally, let’s talk about a specific aspect of the policy related to assets, and by that I mean “greening”, which would involve the ECB purchasing green assets. There is probably no question about the need to explicitly consider climate-related risks in macroeconomic projections, for example. But deviating from the principle of market neutrality is politically more problematic, particularly when there are other important topics, such as the pandemic, which is a risk that until recently most of us didn’t really have on our radar.   That’s true. Climate issues play a prominent role in our planned monetary policy strategy review. We’ve had to postpone our strategy review as a result of the crisis, but we will of course come back to it as soon as we can. And the subject of the pandemic should also be discussed more generally in this context. You are absolutely right that these things need to be included in our macroeconomic models. But so far this has only been done in a very rudimentary way; comprehensive models that include environmental and pandemic risks still need to be developed. That is a major aspect of the new strategy. But the idea of giving certain assets preferential treatment in our purchase programmes is an even more difficult subject. Market neutrality is indeed a fundamental principle of private sector asset purchases.   And it’s true that there are not yet that many green assets around…   Quite. If you wanted to go about it in a targeted way, you wouldn’t find all that much to buy. But it’s not without its problems. When it’s a question of buying such assets, then a lot of people are in favour. But if, for monetary policy reasons, we wanted to buy fewer such assets, or even sell them, it’s not clear that everyone would find that quite so good. One could end up in a difficult situation. We have not yet come to any conclusions about how to deal with the matter, but that doesn’t mean that a way can’t be found in the end to do so in an intelligent manner. And there are other areas, of course, where we can have an impact. With portfolios involving our own assets, for example our pension fund portfolio or our own funds portfolio, we have greater scope and we can commit to a sustainable strategy. But the sums involved are small compared with the portfolio of assets held by the ECB for monetary policy purposes, which mainly consists of government bonds. But when people talk about green assets, they usually mean private sector assets. I would add that, if more green assets are issued, we will automatically be able to buy more of them.  When it comes to buying green assets, doesn’t the ECB risk overstepping the fine line – which is so difficult to define – between monetary policy and economic policy?   That is a discussion we will have as soon as things have calmed down a little. The ECB has a very clear primary objective: price stability. We also have secondary objectives that we need to pursue, provided they don’t interfere with monetary policy. And sustainability is one of them. So the topic is certainly very important to us. That said, of course, monetary policy cannot, and should not, do everything.   If the green market is so small, then the ECB would also dominate it as a buyer.   That could happen. A taxonomy is also an important condition, to deal with the question of what green actually means. And that touches on the debate about “greenwashing”, where activities are labelled as green when they aren’t really. Some progress has been made in this area at the European level, but there is a lot more to be done in order to establish a rigorous and reliable classification. We are following this process and trying to provide impetus so that the market can develop. I have no doubt that this is the direction in which things will go in the future. It also represents an opportunity for the capital markets union in Europe. Achieving a truly European capital market, meaning one that is truly integrated, is a declared aim, but it is still a long way off. However, if something new were to emerge, for example in the area of sustainable financing, it would probably be easier to develop something European rather than trying to Europeanise existing national structures. So if efforts were to be made from the outset to design these assets in a European way, it could provide a major boost for the capital markets union. That would be very important for Europe.

2020-05-27,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 25 May and published on 27 May 2020","   INTERVIEW 27 May 2020  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 25 May and published on 27 May 2020  Thank you for making time to talk to us. I know you have been incredibly busy recently. It has been an extraordinary few weeks. I’d like to start by asking you about the recent German constitutional court ruling against the ECB’s public sector purchase programme (PSPP). How is the ECB going to respond to this?  The ECB is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and therefore this court ruling does not directly affect us. It is directed at the German government and at the German parliament, who now have to respond. The ECJ ruled in December 2018 that the PSPP is legal. Therefore, it is clear for us that we can and have to continue our monetary policy in line with our mandate to make sure that in the medium term we are getting back to our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2 per cent and that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the euro area. So we are not adjusting our monetary policy in any way in response to this ruling.  I understand that as an independent central bank you can’t adjust your monetary policy to the ruling of a national court. But isn’t the easiest way to resolve this situation for the ECB to provide the proportionality assessment the court has requested?  I would argue that we are already doing this. This is what central banks do. They design monetary policy measures, they discuss them, they weigh the pros and cons. This is all documented in various texts that can be found on our website. We publish the monetary policy accounts, which show very clearly that there is always a discussion regarding the pros and cons of different monetary policy measures. In addition, we are accountable to the European Parliament. The president has a monetary policy dialogue every three months, which is streamed on the internet and the transcript of which is available on the website of the European Parliament. So we take transparency and communication very seriously. And we are in a constant process of improving our communication. The question of the proportionality of our actions is part of that.  You say that the ECB is constantly assessing the proportionality of its policies. But the highest court in Germany - the biggest economy in the eurozone and largest shareholder in the ECB - is not convinced that the ECB has done a good enough job of explaining this proportionality, which as you know is a key legal concept in German law. So don’t you need to do more to explain this to the court to resolve the situation?  We try in any of our decisions to make very clear why we are taking them, what are the pros and cons. We also produce research papers and plenty of them are discussing the potential side-effects of monetary policy. And there is the monetary policy strategy review coming up. Unfortunately it had to be postponed a bit. But these kinds of questions naturally will figure prominently in the strategy review.  What would be the impact if the Bundesbank is ordered to stop buying bonds?  I don’t think it will come to that situation. We are in a monetary union, and Germany and the Bundesbank are an important part of that. We have to avoid a situation in which one national central bank cannot participate in our asset purchase programmes.  What would be the impact on Germany bond yield if the Bundesbank did stop buying Bunds?  As I said, that is not going to happen.   Okay, so how are you going to stop it happening?  The Bundesbank is more directly affected by the ruling. But it is also an independent institution. I’m sure there is going to be communication between the Bundesbank and the German parliament and the German government, and one will have to find a solution. If the ECB can be constructive in supporting that process, we will of course do so.  Does the court ruling reflect the general mood in Germany on monetary policy?  I must say that currently I perceive the general attitude towards the ECB’s monetary policy in Germany to be rather positive, and this is also reflected in the reactions to the court ruling. In my view, it was quite balanced. Of course there were some who were supporting the ruling but there were also quite a few critical voices. I think it is appreciated how the ECB is contributing to alleviating the impact of the current pandemic. This appears to have helped to improve the attitude towards the ECB’s monetary policy more generally.  Why is Germany so much more sceptical than other eurozone member states?  I have been worried about some of the narratives in Germany regarding the ECB’s monetary policy for quite a while. I think one of the reasons why this is more visible than in other countries is the role that the Bundesbank has always played in the perception of many German citizens. Therefore, the ECB has been under special scrutiny in Germany. It is perfectly fine to criticise the ECB’s monetary policy, but I was always worried about partially misleading narratives about it. This is why my first big speech in my new role was on exactly that point, trying to put data on the table and to confront all the narratives that are floating around with the data. The result was that many of the narratives that are very popular in Germany cannot be maintained because they simply do not match the facts. It is a bit ironic that some of these narratives appeared in the court ruling, but this shows how deeply rooted they are in Germany. We will have to work even more on our communication in order to explain what monetary policy does and what the positive effects of monetary policy are. Germany is one of the countries that has benefited a lot from the euro and therefore it shouldn’t be the country that is most critical about it.  Have those benefits been explained properly in Germany?  It apparently has been done too little. However, it should not only be done in Germany but in all euro area member states. We see that there is a lot of support for the euro in general. But we have to work on this on a continuous basis. Monetary policy is very complicated. For the citizens it is hard to understand and therefore it is important that we learn to explain monetary policy in simple terms. That is crucial. Our communication is very technical and it is full of acronyms. We have to learn to find a language to explain these things in simple terms. It is also part of the monetary policy strategy review to improve our communication to the citizens. Then it becomes much harder to build such misleading narratives because people start to better understand why the euro benefits them, and how our actions protect its value. For example, if anything, inflation has been too low in the past years, while originally the German fear had been that inflation would be too high. We have gone through very unusual times: there was the big financial crisis, there was the euro area crisis and now we are facing this huge pandemic. These are difficult and extraordinary times. They require constant adjustments to our toolkit and it is difficult for citizens to keep track of that and to understand what is going on. And the numbers involved are so huge, which tends to scare people.   Is the Franco-German proposal for a €500bn European recovery fund sufficient?  The short-term collapse in economic activity has been huge, but now the big open question is what the recovery will look like. One very important point, and we have frequently stressed this, is that we have to avoid an increasing divergence within the euro area. This is why the European initiative is absolutely crucial, because it must not happen that certain countries cannot react properly because they simply do not have the fiscal space. This situation is politically easier than what we had in the past because there is little concern of moral hazard, which played such a prominent role in earlier times. Bundestag president Wolfgang Schäuble also stressed that particular point and very strongly supports the European response. There is actually quite broad support for the proposal in Germany and I very much hope that it will come through.   Why is divergence such a serious risk?  We have a single monetary policy, which works much better and is more easily transmitted to the entire euro area if there is convergence in economic terms. From the ECB’s perspective, a divergence would be highly problematic. But also if you think about growth and trade, we know that the euro area is so closely interconnected that the overall outlook is likely to be much more subdued if the recovery is very uneven.   The early signs on this are not great, are they? The countries with the weaker fiscal positions seem to have been hit harder by the crisis than some of the stronger, northern countries, like Germany.  We are facing a symmetric shock, but this shock is having asymmetric effects. The ultimate impact depends, among other factors, on the fiscal response and the sectoral composition. For example, countries that rely heavily on tourism are affected particularly strongly. This is exactly why a joint European response is so important and why it needs a transfer element. This is not just about giving more loans, which risks exacerbating divergence. We need transfers to those countries that are hit hardest. This is a question of European solidarity. We are experiencing the most severe humanitarian and economic crisis since the Second World War and Europe has to be there to help. But also from a purely economic perspective, it is clear that this asymmetry has to be countered by an appropriate policy response.  Some people have talked about this Franco-German proposal as Europe’s Hamilton moment. Do you see it as a step towards debt mutualisation and even fiscal union?  I certainly think it is an encouraging step in the direction of more European integration. But we shouldn’t overstate it. As the proposal stands, it is only a temporary measure. Nevertheless it shows Germany’s willingness to move in such a direction at a time of substantial economic challenge. There is a basic understanding that we need more integration in Europe in order to be able to deal with such shocks. Debt mutualisation has always been politically very difficult. But this clearly is a sign that there is a willingness to think about constructions at European level that go in the direction of a joint fiscal policy and deficit spending at EU level, which many economists have argued is very important to make the European Union and the euro area more resilient.   Are investors right to be worried about the sustainability of government debt levels?  If you look at markets, I do not have the impression that there is serious concern about debt sustainability. We have seen an increase in sovereign spreads in the market but there is no restriction of market access in any member state. In fact, across the euro area we are seeing very large demand for the bonds that are being issued with often very high bid-to-cover ratios. The European fiscal response is certainly helpful. And it is not just about debt-to-GDP ratios; it is also about the interest rates that have to be paid and economic growth. This is why the recovery fund has to be designed smartly to make sure that the European economy gets back to a higher growth path that is sustainable. It should focus on investment in digitisation, healthcare systems, the carbon-free economy in order to provide an impulse for economic growth.   Do you consider it one of the ECB’s roles to close the spreads in government debt markets?  The ECB watches financing conditions in the euro area very carefully. A very quick divergence in sovereign spreads poses risks of fragmentation that may threaten the transmission of monetary policy to all parts of the euro area. If we see such signs of fragmentation, we have to react. That doesn’t mean that in the end all spreads relative to the German Bund will be equal to zero – and they shouldn’t be, given different fundamentals. But a quick divergence of spreads points towards market dysfunction with risks of running into self-reinforcing spirals. The ECB certainly has to counter such developments.   Are you targeting specific spreads?   We are not targeting spreads, but we are watching them carefully. One useful metric that one can look at is the GDP-weighted euro area yield curve that gives an indication of how tight financial conditions actually are in the euro area. If we see that there is an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions that is not consistent with our price stability objective, the ECB will react. We saw that this curve actually shifted up quite dramatically at the beginning of the crisis and our measures have been able to push it back even though it is not at the same level as before the crisis. You can see that for many of the indicators we look at. You can, for example, look at the funding conditions for corporates or liquidity indicators. Most of them have gone down quite substantially in response to our policy measures but they are still elevated compared to the pre-crisis period. This shows that we are still not in a stable situation and that we have to continue to act forcefully.   Should we expect the ECB’s €750bn Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to run out of ammunition by October if it continues at its current pace?   As you know there is a monetary policy meeting coming up next week and at the same time we will publish new staff forecasts. We are going to look at the numbers very carefully. One number that is of course of particular interest is the evolution of the medium-term inflation outlook. If we see that the situation has deteriorated, and if we judge that further stimulus is needed, the ECB will be ready to expand any of its tools in order to achieve its price stability objective. With respect to the PEPP, this concerns the size but also the composition and the duration of the programme. We are ready to react to new data coming in.   What is your view of how the German economy is coming through this crisis?   At the moment, it looks like the German economy will get through the crisis comparatively well. But the hit will still be substantial. The country’s sectoral structure supports the recovery, as sectors like tourism don’t play a role that is comparable to other euro area countries. So far, the lockdown has been effective. But nobody knows whether there will be a big second wave or many small second waves. Just as other countries, Germany will have the problem that it cannot return to the old normal but that it will have to find a new normal. We cannot be certain what the new normal will look like. We can only be sure that there will be substantial structural change. This has risks and the transition is never easy. But it also opens up opportunities that economic activity shifts towards certain areas that are more conducive to economic growth like digitisation or towards a carbon-free economy. For Germany, that is one of the big challenges given the relevance of the car industry. It is also one of the big vulnerabilities as car demand has collapsed. The question is how this crisis can be used to foster a structural change that provides for high economic growth in the future. The fiscal position in Germany helps but a lot depends on how that money is going to be spent.   Does the ECB have an estimate of the permanent damage, or scarring, being done to the eurozone economy?   It is indeed one of the big concerns that there may be long-term damage to the European economy. How deep this will be depends on the policy response, on the fiscal side and on the monetary side. We will do whatever we can to avoid such long-run damages but in the end fiscal policy will play an even more important role in that respect.  What is your biggest fear for the future? Is it deflation?  In the short run, there are quite a few disinflationary forces. Falling energy prices have already depressed inflation a lot. The medium-term inflation outlook will likely also be challenging but is much more uncertain because there are countervailing forces. On the one hand, there are downward pressures coming from the consumption and investment side related the lockdown and to uncertainty. On the other hand, de-globalisation may have the opposite effect, and supply-side disruptions may put upward pressure on prices. But my main concern is disintegration, which would be very harmful. Europe needs to continue on the path of economic and financial integration and make progress towards completion of the banking and capital markets union. A safe European asset would certainly help integration and would also foster the international role of the euro. These are the main things we should focus on and we should not allow the European economy to disintegrate in any way.   "

It will be made up of direct transfers rather than loans. What do you think of that? Do you think this European fiscal effort will be sufficient to prevent the ECB from having to do all the work on its own?   The Franco-German proposals are ambitious, targeted and, of course, welcome. They pave the way for the European Commission to borrow funds over the long term and, above all, they allow a substantial amount of direct support to be provided to the countries most affected by the crisis. This is testament to the spirit of solidarity and responsibility the German Chancellor herself mentioned last week. There can’t be greater financial solidarity unless there is also greater coordination of decision-making at the European level.  European countries are slowly emerging from the lockdown. What is your assessment of the economic shock facing the euro area?  The shock is huge, unprecedented in peacetime. We need to counter it with determination to help our economies to recover as quickly as possible, avoiding a social crisis. Our scenarios put the recession at between 5% and 12% in the euro area this year, with a medium scenario of 8%. We will see what our projections say on 4 June, but in our most severe scenario we are expecting GDP to fall by 15% in the second quarter alone. It’s difficult to assess what the impact will be in each country of relaxing the lockdown measures, particularly if we have to incorporate the possibility of a second wave of the epidemic in the autumn. But one thing seems likely: if there is a second wave, it probably won’t be as bad as the first one from an economic point of view because we will be able to benefit from experience.  What is the mandate of the ECB in the unprecedented crisis brought about by the coronavirus (COVID-19)? According to the Treaties, it doesn’t include growth and employment…  Price stability is at the heart of our mandate, with inflation of below, but close to, 2%. In a situation like the one we are facing, with inflation currently below and projected to fall short of the objective in the coming years and the economy in deep contraction, the ECB has to ensure as much accommodation as needed to stabilise inflation and the economy. We have to act whenever a risk emerges of a tightening in financial conditions. For this purpose we need to make sure that our monetary policy is being transmitted properly to all countries in the euro area and to all sectors. That is the whole point of our extraordinary measure, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).  So, all countries where monetary policy doesn’t seem to be having the desired effect deserve help?  Of course. The transmission of monetary policy is just as important as monetary policy itself.  The sovereign debt crisis in 2012 and the Greek crisis in 2015 called into question the very existence of the euro. The economic crisis we are now facing is of a much greater magnitude altogether. Is there a risk of the euro area breaking apart?  No. The situation is not the same at all. This time it’s not a question of a crisis stemming from the financial and real estate sectors which then spreads to the entire economy, nor of one country diverging completely from the others as a result of a bad combination of economic policies. This is a symmetrical shock which is hitting all economies at the same time. To protect the health of their citizens, European governments decided to partly close down their economies. So it is important for all countries to restart well and make use of all the measures at their disposal.   So there is zero risk to the euro?  Yes. And I would remind you that the euro is irreversible, it’s written in the EU Treaty.  Yield spreads for the government debt of southern European countries are higher than they were at the beginning of March, despite the measures you have taken. Are you satisfied?  As I said, our role is to ensure that monetary policy is properly transmitted across all the countries in the euro area. We will continue to act undeterred. Since 18 March, the day we announced the PEPP, spreads against the German ten-year Bund have fallen in Italy, Spain and Portugal.  What is your view of the way political leaders are responding to the crisis? When your predecessor said “whatever it takes” in 2012, it came after, rather than before, governments had made commitments.  At the national level, governments have grasped the scale of the challenge. With their direct support for households, payment deferrals and guarantees for the private sector, they have mobilised funds equivalent to 20% of euro area GDP. That’s a lot. And the European Commission, for its part, has suspended the limits of the Stability and Growth Pact and relaxed the rules on state aid – that was essential. But there is a limit to all of that; the measures taken have been too asymmetric across countries, varying from 2% to 40% of GDP. The countries with the weakest economies, which in some cases are those that have been hit hardest by the virus, do not have the fiscal headroom to do what is needed to restart their economies. The solution, therefore, is a European programme of rapid and robust fiscal stimulus to restore symmetry between the countries when they exit from the crisis. In other words, more help must be given to those countries that need it most. It is in the interests of all countries to provide such collective support.   What concrete measures do you expect from the European Council?   The Council has a huge responsibility: it must find an adequate response to the severity of the situation, the economic damage and the social suffering. Where are we so far? €540 billion has already potentially been made available, taking together the support from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), more guarantees to companies (focused on small and medium-sized enterprises) pledged by the European Investment Bank, and the European Commission’s SURE initiative which, from June, is set to co-finance short-time work schemes. The credit lines provided by the ESM have nothing to do with the rescue packages of the past; each country has the option of borrowing funds amounting to up to 2% of its GDP, at very low rates and with minimal conditions attached. Countries will only need to demonstrate that the funds will be used to cover direct or indirect healthcare costs related to fighting the pandemic. This package of support measures is welcome, but it is clearly insufficient to get the euro area economy going again.  What order of magnitude do you think is necessary?  We estimate that the additional government financing needs arising from this crisis will be in the range of €1 trillion to €1.5 trillion for 2020 alone. Some will manage that without difficulty, others will need European financial solidarity. Its size and composition will depend on the ambition of the Heads of State or Government, guided by Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen. This European stimulus programme, which I hope will be substantial in size and quickly mobilised, should also be used to invest in common public goods which are best funded collectively rather than individually, because it is more efficient that way. These include health security and the transition towards an economy that is greener, more digital and better protects biodiversity.   If the European Council doesn’t put in place a sufficiently large stimulus fund, can the most vulnerable countries count on the ECB’s rescue programme (Outright Monetary Transactions), and what conditions would be attached to the programme?   Outright Monetary Transactions, or OMTs, are an important instrument in the European toolbox, but they were designed for the 2011-12 crisis, which was very different from this one. I don’t think it is the tool that would be best suited to tackling the economic consequences of the public health crisis created by COVID-19. For the systemic shock we are facing today, the PEPP – our programme for purchasing €750 billion of public and private sector securities – seems the most appropriate tool.  Its size was calibrated in March, when we only had an imprecise view of the recession. If your projections develop in June, will that be the time to increase it?  On this topic, we have been very clear and we continue to be very clear – we will not hesitate to adjust the size, duration and composition of the PEPP to the extent necessary. We will use all the necessary flexibility within our mandate. There is no psychological obstacle to our action.  The budgetary situation in Italy, Spain and France was already challenging before the crisis. Doesn’t their current situation send chills down your spine? Should the Stability and Growth Pact be abandoned?  The priority now is to help the economies to get back on their feet. States are spending, so debts are naturally increasing. The debt-to-GDP ratio is going to worsen, because we are in a recession. Every country in the world is seeing its debt level increase – according to the IMF’s projections, the debt level of the United States will reach more than 130% of GDP by the end of this year, while the euro area’s debt will be below 100% of GDP. That’s an average, of course; there are differences between countries in the euro area.  But we shouldn’t focus on the debt-to-GDP ratio if we want to assess the sustainability of the debt. Growth levels and prevailing interest rates should be taken into account, as these are the two key elements. I think this crisis is a good time to update the modalities of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is currently suspended. Some innovative proposals have been made in the recent past, especially by the IMF; it would be good to re-examine them to assess their relevance and their efficiency before restoring the Pact. We should ensure that a revamped and simplified pact comes into effect once we are out of this crisis.  What do you think about the idea of “coronabonds”, of shared debt?  What’s important is that all European countries appreciate the extent to which they are interdependent – a car production line in Germany could grind to a halt because of a lack of spare parts from Italy, Spain or France. Trade within the euro area is now so integrated that it is clearly in the interest of all countries, and the strongest countries in particular, that the weakest countries get back on their feet. Otherwise, everyone will lose out. If the European recovery plan combines EU grants with loans with very long maturities and low rates, primarily aimed at the countries most in need of them, we will have taken a huge step forward in terms of European financial solidarity.  How would you define “very long maturities”? 10 years? 30? 50?  For the recovery fund, the maturity should be at least 10 years, but it’s clear that longer maturities would help spread the costs of the crisis over time. At the ECB, we buy bonds with a maturity as long as 30 years.  What is really at stake with the decision of the Karlsruhe Constitutional Court? Your independence? The primacy of European law? Germany’s attitude towards the EU? Or the euro itself?   We have taken note of that judgement. The ECB is subject to European law, it is accountable to the European Parliament, and it is under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union. In December 2018, the CJEU stated that the ECB’s purchases of government bonds (under the PSPP) were entirely consistent with its mandate and with European law.   But isn’t this fundamentally calling into question the European legal order? Europe is built on the rule of law…   Europe is built on a very clear legal architecture. This includes the independence of the ECB, which is guaranteed by the EU Treaty, and is a pillar of German monetary thinking. This independence is the ECB’s strength for achieving its mandate.  Can you continue to utilise your debt purchase programmes despite this decision?  Yes. The judgement of the German Constitutional Court is clear – it says that the PEPP, which was decided on in the context of the pandemic, is not affected by the judgement. I am not at all worried, not about the programme linked to the pandemic (the PEPP), and not about the previous programme, under which the Eurosystem has been purchasing bonds since 2015 (the PSPP). As I already pointed out, the European Court of Justice ruled in December 2018 that this programme was consistent with the EU Treaty. We remain undeterred in delivering on our price stability objective.  Aren’t you afraid that some doubt has been injected into the financial markets, which will limit the effectiveness of your policies?  The PEPP is a purchase programme that is targeted and time-limited for the purpose of responding to exceptional circumstances. The other European institutions have also taken exceptional measures during this crisis.   The legitimacy of the PEPP is assured thanks to the exceptional situation?  It is absolutely justified by the exceptional shock.   But what position will the Bundesbank take, and how will it participate (or not) in the ECB’s programmes under these conditions?  According to the Treaty, all national central banks should fully participate in the determination and implementation of monetary policy in the euro area.   Does the Bundesbank have freedom to decide here?   Each national central bank in the euro area is independent and cannot take instructions from governments. This is laid down in the Treaty.  But what is your role, the ECB’s role, in this conflict?  My conviction is clear. The ECB has been assigned a mandate by all the Member States of the European Union, when they drafted and ratified the Treaty. The ECB is under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. And we will continue to be accountable to the European Parliament and to explain our policies to European citizens.    If we look several years ahead, how will the most indebted countries be able to rid themselves of the debts they took on because of the virus? Will they be written off? Or reduced? Or will the repayments be spread out?  The solution is for robust, sustainable growth to enable the debt burden to be cushioned over time and to allow our economies to grow in a harmonious and socially sustainable way.  Among some economists, the theoretical idea of perpetual debt is going down well…  It is indeed a theoretical idea.  You were previously in Washington, at the head of the IMF, and returned to Europe a few months ago. What strikes you most?  I came back to Europe with the same convictions – our growth models should evolve, and profoundly so, to anticipate and slow down climate change; inequality is dangerous; globalisation should be more respectful of human beings. From this point of view, Europe holds fundamental and precious values that can inspire the rest of the world. It is up to us to defend those values.    "

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luis Doncel on 11 May 2020 and published on 18 May 2020","   INTERVIEW 18 May 2020  Interview with El País   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luis Doncel on 11 May 2020 and published on 18 May 2020  Since the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak spread throughout Europe, the ECB has flooded the market with massive debt purchases and liquidity for the banking sector, but it doesn’t seem to have been enough. What tools do you have left?  What we observed in response to the spread of the virus and the containment measures that have been implemented across Europe and the globe is that financing conditions tightened significantly. For policymakers it is crucial to both counter forces that could amplify the shock and to avoid the temporary shock hurting economic performance in the long run. Our monetary policy is making an important contribution here: making sure that the necessary monetary and financial conditions for the restoration of economic activity are in place, in line with the easing of the containment measures. The contribution of our pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) is to make sure that financial conditions remain sufficiently accommodative and to help stabilise markets. Our asset purchases are complemented by our targeted lending programme and our collateral easing measures, which ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy through banks to firms and households. So the ECB has done a lot already. And we are continuously monitoring the situation and are ready to adjust all our instruments if necessary.  At its June meeting, the ECB is expected to announce an increase in the PEPP, which was launched in March to the tune of €750 billion.  We are a goal-oriented institution and this applies equally to our monetary policy measures. So the precise configuration of the PEPP is guided by the two tasks it has: improving monetary conditions and stabilising financial markets. The exact figure is of secondary importance. We are constantly assessing whether we are doing enough and if there is a risk of instability. The June meeting is still three weeks away, and we are in the process of analysing the situation. If we see that financial conditions are too tight, or the pressure on individual bond markets is not reflecting economic fundamentals, we can adjust the size or duration of our purchases, which we can anyway allocate flexibly over time and market segments. Our aim is to ensure that financial conditions are appropriate for all markets and to help counter rather than amplify the impact of the pandemic shock on the economy.  The German Constitutional Court just declared the debt purchase programme launched by Mario Draghi to be partially unconstitutional. Although this verdict does not explicitly mention the new bond purchases launched in response to the pandemic, doesn’t it significantly reduce the ECB’s room for manoeuvre in future decisions?  No, I don’t agree with that. Following the judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court, we said that we remain focused on our mandate. Whenever we act, whether through interest rates or asset purchases, our aim is to ensure price stability over the medium term. We are certain that everything we do is necessary to fulfil our mandate. And we will do what we have to in order to fulfil our mandate.  Can the ECB go against the most important country in the euro area?  We are an independent central bank. The ECB is a unique institution, with 19 member countries. Sometimes, this can lead to headaches. But the fact that 19 countries are watching each other also helps to ensure that we are independent. At the same time, independence comes with accountability: towards the European Parliament, and, of course, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which ruled in favour of our public sector purchase programme.  How do you respond to the accusation from Germany that you are mixing fiscal and monetary policy and overstepping your powers?  Monetary policy acts on interest rates and, by doing so, it always has implications for the financing conditions of all sectors in the economy: firms, households and also governments. What the Treaty explicitly rules out is that we directly finance governments, in other words that we conduct monetary financing. But we are careful to remain at a good distance from that, and this has also been confirmed by the court rulings. It is important to recognise that inflation has been very low, and we have had to implement expansionary monetary policy measures to lift it to levels that are closer to our inflation aim. Let us also not forget that in the past, in different circumstances, the ECB has had to take decisions that were not universally popular, including with governments, such as raising interest rates. So our independence is crucial if we are to fulfil our mandate.  Christine Lagarde was heavily criticised in March when she said that the ECB isn’t here to close spreads. Hasn’t the institution, through what it has done and contrary to what its President said, shown that this is, in fact, its task?  Before this crisis we could see significant differences in the interest rates different countries had to pay on their own debt. In normal times, interest rate spreads across countries reflect the economic fundamentals of each country, including the levels of public debt. This is not something we are trying to get rid of. But in March spreads were widening rapidly, in a way that could not be explained by fundamentals. When there is market turmoil and spreads widen rapidly due to market dislocation, the central bank has to act as a stabilising factor for the markets. This is especially true in a monetary union, where you can easily switch from the bonds of one country into those of another country in the same currency. The stabilising presence of the central banks can then rule out self-fulfilling flight-to-safety dynamics and illiquidity in individual sovereign bond markets, and this is what we pledged to do.  The ECB forecasts a fall in euro area GDP of between 5 percent and 12 percent this year. There are risks of new outbreaks and it’s becoming increasingly clear that we will have to get used to strict measures that will damage the economy even more. Are we witnessing the worst-case scenarios that will bring about this 12 percent fall?  The scenarios we presented reflect the current situation. In March the pandemic and the measures to contain it had already led to a substantial contraction of activity. This situation got worse again in April, where we saw a deep fall in activity everywhere. Now the picture is changing: some countries are beginning to loosen their lockdowns. How this will develop in the future depends a lot on how quickly the restrictions on economic activity can be eased, but also on how we adapt to living with the virus. The speed at which the economy bounces back will then hinge on whether consumers are more reluctant to consume and businesses hold back on investment. From today’s perspective, it looks in any case unlikely that economic activity will return to its pre-crisis level before 2021, if not later.  What form will the exit from the crisis take?  This crisis is truly unprecedented, which makes it harder to predict the precise shape the recovery will take. What we know for sure is that the steepest fall will be in the first half of the year, and these terrible economic conditions should recover little by little, week by week, month by month.  The exit will differ greatly between countries, according to their economic strength and how robust their public finances are. Will Europe’s north-south divide increase even more in the wake of the crisis?  The fiscal response has been centre stage: all governments have been able to implement fiscal policies, although not all to the same degree. One point that I think is important is that Europe as a whole benefits when a country like Germany responds to the crisis more emphatically because, for example, it can boost Spanish or Irish exports. So we shouldn’t necessarily see these differences as negative: it is good news that countries with strong finances are responding forcefully to the crisis. But it is also important that all countries recover, and policymakers play a central role in this respect. We at the ECB will ensure that financial conditions are sufficiently accommodative and stable for all countries.  The EU is currently discussing what form the recovery fund should take to avoid a depression. If the agreement is ultimately based more on loans than on transfers, will it help to pull heavily indebted countries like Spain and Italy out of the slump? What ratio of loans to transfers would be sustainable?  Rather than focus on the question of transfers or loans, I think it is useful to look at this more in terms of the following question: what should be financed at European level and what at national level? One of the proposals under discussion is to increase the EU’s budget and have the European Commission distribute the funds. One advantage of this proposal is that it would not entail an increase in national public debt, and keeping the cost of debt low will help governments tackle the pandemic and support the recovery. Instruments like the Commission’s SURE programme, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or the European Investment Bank also make an important contribution in this respect.  Many people in Spain and Italy are awaiting the European response and seeing it as a test of solidarity. Are you concerned about a wave of nationalism and anti-European sentiment if this response is not as emphatic as expected?  There is no doubt that Spain and Italy have been on the front line of this battle. And I understand the critics who are saying that the initial response has been somewhat slow, but I would also say that there are many different aspects to European solidarity. Being part of the monetary union has meant that the shock has been less severe in economic terms than it would have been if those countries were outside the union. The ECB has intervened and has been a very important source of stability, benefiting all euro area countries. The creation of the banking union and the ESM has also provided stability. I think it is clear that without a single European banking supervisor, we would not have seen such a fast and effective response. So there are clear advantages to being a member of the euro. But I agree that there is still more to be done to deal with this unprecedented crisis. In particular, it is important to make sure that the funding is in place to guard against downside risks and support the recovery in all EU countries. Joint and coordinated policy action has a crucial role to play here.  The Spanish government is finalising its minimum income scheme, which is designed to help one million vulnerable families. What do you think is more suitable, a temporary instrument or permanent support that reduces inequality over the long term?  It’s not for me to get involved in Spanish politics. At a general level though, we often see that debates about safety nets change when a country is going through a recession. In a downturn, a safety net provides solidarity, but it also matters from a macroeconomic perspective: a large-scale shock to household income is destabilising for the economy as a whole, so buffering the shock helps. In these situations, possible concerns that a safety net could interfere with the efficiency of the labour market is not the most immediate concern.  In Spain, more than 3.5 million workers have benefited from the furlough scheme [in Spanish: expedientes de regulación temporal, or ERTEs]. To what extent do these temporary protection mechanisms help avoid the permanent destruction of jobs?  Everyone agrees that it is important to establish protection mechanisms for people whose jobs have been affected by the current circumstances. There are a number of ways of achieving this: one is to provide generous unemployment benefits, and another is to fund wages publicly in order to keep workers connected to their employers. Which of these measures is most appropriate in a given situation will depend on a host of factors, including whether firms are viable in the long run and whether there is sufficient demand for workers.

2020-05-14,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Der Standard,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andras Szigetvari on 6 May and published on 14 May 2020","   INTERVIEW 14 May 2020  Interview with Der Standard   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Andras Szigetvari on 6 May and published on 14 May 2020  The European Central Bank has responded to the crisis by launching a new emergency programme, under which it will buy €750 billion of securities, mainly government bonds, by the end of the year. At the same time, European rules have been loosened and the usual limits on government deficits no longer apply. Can governments now take on as much debt as they like?   We are currently going through a severe economic shock. The first and most important thing we have to do is to maintain the euro area’s productive capacity. This crisis is affecting weak and strong companies alike, because their revenues disappeared from one day to the next. It would be a very serious mistake to let viable companies go bankrupt and lose the productive capacity we need for the recovery. By improving financing conditions for all sectors of the economy, our monetary policy complements and reinforces the European and national measures taken to provide relief to the economy. And the more we protect our productive capacity today, the easier it will be to manage public debt in the future.   Italy announced a massive €50 billion stimulus programme a few days ago. Interestingly, yields on Italian government debt have fallen. That was never the case in normal times – whenever a southern European country announced an increase in spending, yields rose.  It isn’t a law of nature that a country’s risk premia rises just because it plans to spend more money. If a government announces that it is increasing spending when there are no grounds to do so, that is in a pro-cyclical way that increases economic risks eventually, yields generally go up. But when governments’ action reduces economic risks in a counter-cyclical way and monetary policy is acting in tandem to stabilise the economy, yields typically go down. It would be much worse if fiscal policy was not used in the current situation, even in countries where public debt is relatively high.   What do you fear more at the moment: higher inflation, because the ECB is pumping so much money into the markets, or deflation, meaning falling prices?  Right now we’re facing a situation where companies aren’t really in a position to offer their goods and services. But that is only part of the story: the prevailing uncertainty and higher unemployment are severely affecting demand. On top of that, there are the effects of cheap oil, weak international demand and weak trade developments. All of that is weighing on prices. It’s clearly a disinflationary environment.  So the ECB needs to do even more to avoid deflation?  We will do everything that is necessary to secure price stability in line with our mandate and avoid disinflationary or even deflationary risks. And we remain determined not to tolerate any tightening of financing conditions for as long as the economic damage caused by Covid-19 persists. We have all the necessary tools, we are using them decisively.   But if we see a recovery in 2021 and a rise in oil prices, wouldn’t there be a risk of much higher inflation?  I wouldn’t expect to see that. We think that inflation will stay very low for the next two or three years, well below our definition of price stability. I can’t say what will happen in ten years, but I note that market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels.   But then shouldn’t the ECB change its inflation objective? Inflation has fallen short of your target of below, but close to, 2% for years, and you’re saying that this is set to continue. Why not match the target to reality?  That wouldn’t be a good idea. There are sound reasons why we chose our objective of below, but close to, 2%. First, it grants a safety margin to deflationary territory, also taking into account possible cross-country differences in the price level. And it’s extremely hard and extremely expensive to find a way out of a deflationary situation. This margin is also important as it implies that nominal interest rates are higher, giving additional policy space for monetary accommodation, and makes it easier for real wages to adjust if needed. Moreover, there is a possibility of distortion when measuring inflation as price pressures can also reflect improvements in product quality, which means that measured inflation is always somewhat higher than actual inflation. A US study puts that distortion at as much as 1%.   Governments are pumping a great deal of money into the economy, with expenditure rising everywhere. The ECB is supporting the process from its side. When will we see a return to the old normality?  To paraphrase Einstein, as soon as possible but no sooner. It would be counterproductive if, having made every effort to keep the economy going, policy support were then to be switched off too early. What would happen then? Growth would immediately disappear again. So on the monetary policy side we will need to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner. And on the fiscal side, it will be key to have self-sustaining economic growth. One of the big mistakes after the financial crisis was that fiscal policy in the euro area shifted too quickly to a pro-cyclical stance. Spending was cut during the crisis, and that is always fatal. But this time we have seen a substantial response even from countries that were previously very conservative in their spending. So I’m optimistic that the euro area has learned this lesson.  Former ECB President Mario Draghi has said that one of the biggest changes in this crisis is that government debt will be much higher than it was before. Do you agree? And what consequences will this have?  Yes, I would agree. But I would also expect interest rates to stay low for a long time. Three factors determine whether a country’s debt is sustainable: the level of debt compared with economic output; the rate of growth of the economy; and interest rates. So, on the one hand, we will be worse off, because government debt will be higher. But there are also a number of factors keeping interest rates low in the future, which are by no means solely attributable to the ECB.  Which factors?   First and foremost, demographic developments, the ageing of societies in many industrialised countries. As that entails an excess in saving and less potential for innovation, many economists refer to a secular stagnation: economic growth slows down, also lowering inflation and interest rates because there is less demand for capital.   How long can that work for?  The path towards secular stagnation is not inevitable. It all depends on whether we succeed in stimulating growth. Stronger growth makes it easier to service debt. Households that have a good income find it easier to keep up their loan repayments.   The eurozone comprises 19 countries. What would happen if growth returned in the north and inflation increased there, but not in the south, not in Italy? The ECB has to conduct policy for all countries in the euro area. Wouldn’t it be a dilemma if higher interest rates were needed in the north but not at all in the south?   One of the biggest challenges is to prevent the eurozone from emerging from this crisis with even more regional fragmentation than it had on entering it. This risk is real and one reason why we need a symmetrical and forceful response to this crisis. Not out of solidarity towards anyone in particular, that is a moral category, but because of our tight economic interlinkages. If one part of the euro area falls into a deep and prolonged recession, do you really think that the rest could forge ahead as if nothing had happened? No. So it is in every country’s own interest to secure the recovery across the euro area and to collectively provide resources to that end.   How can such joint development be achieved?   What matters now is to stabilise the economy. Next comes a phase in which we need investment, with the environment meriting particular attention. Some countries, as has also emerged, will need to invest in their healthcare infrastructure. And, as always, innovation and human capital – i.e. education – remain central. There are sensible strategies for boosting growth through public investment in these sectors.   Do the additional public debts actually ever need to be repaid?  The lower the costs of servicing debts, the easier they are to bear. Many prominent economists believe that, given structurally low interest rates, advanced economies can tolerate higher debts today without having to rush into premature fiscal consolidation. What matters is whether the debt is financing productive spending that leads to higher future growth.   Japan has debt of more than 200%. The country is barely growing, but appears to have no problem with this mountain of debt.   If a country needs to borrow in order to fire up growth, to generate innovation, then it makes perfect sense to run up higher debts to finance productive spending. But not indefinitely. At a certain point, these investments will need to pay off, allowing debt to be repaid through the growth they generate, otherwise the government faces a problem.   Could the current situation result in a banking crisis? The hotel sector – which is highly dependent on bank loans – has been massively hit by the crisis. If borrowers default en masse, it will be problematic.   Banks are more resilient today than they were a decade ago, but we can’t rule out risks. If there is a longer recession, the financial sector will be hit too. But compared with the time of the financial crisis, governments are now far more aware of the kind of difficulties that could lie ahead for the financial sector. Countries are offering government guarantees to borrowers. They are intended to protect borrowers but offer security for the banks at the same time. Moreover, this time European banking supervision has relaxed some rules, enabling banks to more easily provide loans to businesses and avoiding undesirable pro-cyclical lending policies by banks. A credit freeze in the private sector would only exacerbate the turmoil.   In its decision last week, the German Federal Constitutional Court set its sights on the ECB’s asset purchase programme. Among other things, it criticised the fact that the ECB had never explained that its actions were proportionate. The Court objected that, as interest rates were so low, the ECB had affected savers.  The ECB does not fall under the jurisdiction of the German Federal Constitutional Court, but rather under that of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which ruled in December 2018 that the ECB is acting within its price stability mandate and in compliance with the principle of proportionality. The German Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling is addressed to the German Federal Government and the Bundestag. And the Deutsche Bundesbank is in close contact with them.  Did the Court understand the ECB’s strategy? Its argument was that the ECB also needed to consider other effects of its policy, such as its impact on house prices and on savers.   The ECB has repeatedly discussed these issues in public in the past, including as part of its accountability to the European Parliament. We have spoken extensively about the potential side effects of our public sector purchase programme. There have been ECB publications on the topic as well as frequent interactions with parliamentarians. Proportionality was discussed in detail, also with the Court of Justice of the European Union in the course of its decision about our programme.   Do you see it that way too, have German and Austrian savers been harmed by the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy?   No, in my view, the ECB’s policy was beneficial for both German and Austrian people, who are at the same time savers, employees, mortgage holders. Many of the jobs that were created in the euro area over the past few years were in these countries. Their economies grew particularly strongly after the financial crisis, increasing the income that can be saved, and the ECB had a significant role in that. As regards interest earnings, they ultimately depend on growth – only when the economy grows interest rates can increase – and our policy has underpinned that growth.    "

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Dorinde Meuzelaar and Martin Visser on 8 May 2020 and published on 12 May 2020","   INTERVIEW 12 May 2020  Interview with the Telegraaf   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Dorinde Meuzelaar and Martin Visser on 8 May 2020 and published on 12 May 2020  How serious are the consequences of the coronavirus (COVID-19) for the economy?   Uncertainty is the key word. Our scenarios factor in a contraction of between 5 and 12 percent. We are now in the trough, but I expect the data to improve over the summer, even though people have now accepted that the virus will continue for some time: restaurants are reopening, but with fewer tables; factories are starting up again, but with lower production. We also need to ask what consumers will do: those who have, say, just lost their jobs will consume less for the time-being. So whether we return to the situation before the crisis or whether there will be a permanent effect is still uncertain.   Are governments doing enough?   Governments and the central bank hold different responsibilities. The ECB must ensure that there is ample liquidity. We also know from previous crises that markets freeze, so we must make sure that funds are available and that the markets stabilise. Governments have a different task: they for example address the harm to workers from losing their jobs by topping up their incomes.   Do all euro area countries have enough fiscal space for such stimulus measures?   There is no doubt that some countries entered into this crisis with larger buffers than others. What is most important is not whether all countries are doing as much as each other, but whether each country is doing enough. An insufficient fiscal response by any country would make the shock worse. There is enough scope: the European Commission relaxed the standards set under the Stability and Growth Pact for that reason. And there is a spillover effect. If strong countries do more, the whole of Europe benefits. If Germany starts performing strongly again, for example, it would also step up its imports from the rest of Europe.   Are you not concerned that the sovereign debt of a country such as Italy is reaching dangerously high levels?   Many countries will see a rise in their debt, even by 20 or more percentage points. But you also have to look at the overall picture. As shown by the examples of China and Japan that also saw their debt levels surge, if the bulk of that debt is held by households in their own countries, a high public debt does not generate external economic pressure. Today, the increase in debt in Europe is largely owed to European households: that is a completely different situation to what we saw in the euro area 12 years ago, when the debt was held by foreign creditors: debts then start to weigh on the economy, generating instability. So, from a European perspective, it’s important to take a broader view of debt issuance that takes into account whether the debt is owed to European investors or global investors. Interest rates are important, too. Debt has a completely different impact on an economy when the prevailing interest rate is four percent than when it is zero percent. Interest rates have been falling globally for many years now, for example because of demographic ageing and other sources of high saving rates.   But isn’t the ECB itself seeking to keep interest rates low through its pandemic emergency purchase programme?   Yes, indeed. But compared with other factors, the central bank plays a modest role. Owing to the high supply of savings compared to the limited investment demand, the real interest rate stands at zero percent.   Aren’t you being too modest about your role? Were it not for the ECB’s purchases, the spread between Italian and German government bond yields would be far higher.   Those differences are always there. When a crisis occurs, investors flee to the safest and most liquid assets, namely to German Bunds. So even if there is no change at all in the fundamental factors, such as the public debt or the public deficit, yield spreads widen during times of crisis. If investors know that the central bank is present in the market, this acts as a stabilising force: investors will be less inclined to run towards the safe haven of the bund market: when we stabilise markets, spreads narrow due to the containment of such non-fundamental forces.   But the ECB also purchased bonds when the eurozone economy was performing really well. Might you be taking the stabilising role a little too seriously?   There is a difference between the pandemic emergency purchase programme and the programme of quantitative easing that we embarked on in 2015. The latter came about because inflation was falling short of our objective. We now need a programme on top of that to stabilise the economy and return to the “normal” situation.   Is the policy of asset purchases proportionate? The German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the ECB does not sufficiently consider the negative side effects.   When we started the asset purchase programme in 2015, there was a risk of deflation. Our first step was to ensure that inflation did not enter into a downward spiral. Inflation is still below our objective, but we have always said that we would remain prudent and patient. We don’t want to purchase debt to an extent that would distort the functioning of the financial markets. We only buy a monthly amount that is fixed in advance and we will stop as soon as the inflation aim is reached. For me that means that the purchase programme is proportionate.  Political controversy has arisen about the joint issuance of “coronabonds”. What is your view on that?   That is up to the Member States themselves. But the evidence indicates that there would be strong demand for them among global investors. Moreover, the debate is an entirely different one to that at the time of the euro debt crisis. The focus was then on the joint refinancing of existing debts, whereas it now centres on the joint issuance of the new debt needed in order to tackle this shock, which is affecting all countries. If some countries cannot do enough to counter the virus, the entire EU suffers as a result. For many countries, coronabonds would be a cheaper source of financing.   But what advantage would that have for the Netherlands?   In the long term, I think that this would result in greater prosperity across the eurozone. That would be good for the Netherlands too.    "
2020-05-11,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with La Repubblica,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni and published on 11 May 2020","   INTERVIEW 11 May 2020  Interview with La Repubblica   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni and published on 11 May 2020  The German Constitutional Court said that the ECB's public sector purchase programme (PSPP) is partly unconstitutional. Do you think this verdict could hamper the ECB's actions? Some commentators are suggesting the “whatever it takes” effect could be gone now?  The ECB is a European institution, meaning that the European Court of Justice has exclusive jurisdiction over the ECB and its actions. It ruled in 2018 that the PSPP is legal. As stressed by the ECB’s President, we are undeterred in our willingness and ability to act. We will continue to conduct the PSPP and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), as well as our other monetary policy measures, in line with our mandate. This message also seems to have been well-understood by market participants.  Is it dangerous if a national court declares a verdict of Europe’s highest court to be “ultra vires”, or illegitimate? Isn't this a sort of nationalism that could undermine the European institutions and even endanger the eurozone?  It is not for me to judge the legal aspects of the verdict, but its implications can clearly go beyond the ECB. The primacy of EU law is key for the functioning of the European Union.  The ECB foresees a very strong contraction of the eurozone economy in the worst-case scenario; up to 12% for this year. Christine Lagarde spoke of an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that is unprecedented in recent history. Inflation is also weakening rapidly, as you said in the last bulletin. So why did the ECB last week focus mainly on helping banks instead of increasing its coronavirus stimulus programme?  Yes, we are indeed facing a very deep economic crisis, on top of a humanitarian crisis, which has hit Italy particularly hard. The ECB has responded forcefully and swiftly in order to mitigate the economic and financial fallout from the crisis. We have adopted a very broad set of measures, including additional asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) and under the new PEPP. The PEPP gives us ample flexibility to allocate our purchases across time, asset classes and jurisdictions. We are using this flexibility to make sure that our monetary policy is transmitted to all euro area countries. And we stand ready to adjust the size and duration of the programme if needed. But the euro area economy is largely bank-based, also in Italy where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role. SMEs typically rely heavily on bank funding. Measures directed at the banking sector are therefore a crucial element of our policy package. They directly support lending to the real economy. This is why we are offering liquidity to banks at very favourable rates. And we have significantly eased collateral requirements, also by freezing collateral eligibility in the event of rating downgrades, so that banks can make full use of our operations. As a package, these measures reinforce each other and support both European households and firms in these very difficult times.  What do you expect now from the banks, after the decisions you took at the last Governing Council meeting?  We have seen a strong increase in bank lending in March. This is partly related to credit lines being drawn down, particularly by companies that are facing a dramatic drop in their revenues. Some companies are also drawing down their credit lines for precautionary reasons. Our operations ensure that banks have the necessary liquidity to meet this demand. And they provide strong incentives for banks to extend credit to the real economy.  Take our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs): In these operations, a bank only gets the most favourable rates if it meets a certain lending target. Then rates can be as low as 50 basis points below our lowest policy rate, the deposit facility rate, which is currently at -0.5%. Due to this favourable pricing, we expect a large take-up in these operations. In addition, we introduced a new set of operations last week – the pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations, or PELTROs. They complement the TLTROs by effectively providing a liquidity backstop for banks, at still favourable rates. They can be used by banks that specialise in lending that is not eligible for our TLTROs, like real estate lending or lending to public entities, or by banks that have exhausted their limits under the TLTROs.   The United States have made a much bigger effort than Europe. The Federal Reserve will be buying unlimited bonds and now even junk bonds. Donald Trump has said that he will invest USD 2 trillion to help the economy recover from the crisis. Are the ECB and Europe doing too little, and maybe also too late?  The ECB’s measures form a powerful package. We acted swiftly and decisively, also because we already had a broad-based and flexible toolkit at our disposal. We could rapidly scale up our measures, for example by expanding our purchases of commercial paper, or by adjusting our operations with banks. Overall, the impact of our measures is substantial. And we will expand all of our measures further if and when warranted. On the fiscal side, there have been a number of important measures at national level. Many Member States, including Italy, have implemented sizeable packages to mitigate the impact of the crisis. There has also been good progress at the European level. The policy package that is currently under preparation – including the SURE instrument for the unemployed, the European Investment Bank (EIB) guarantee fund, and the Pandemic Crisis Support for sovereigns under the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – is an important first step. But most observers would agree that more is needed. The recovery fund will be a central element in these discussions. I hope that a consensus on an effective fiscal response at European level can be reached that is commensurate to the challenges we are facing today.  Going back again to last week: it's predictable, given the fact that corporate debts, but of course also government debts, are rising everywhere, that some might be downgraded. Some started already with Italy, which is at this moment a country to look at. Why didn't the ECB follow the Federal Reserve's decision to also buy junk bonds for the APP and PEPP and so on?  We are well aware that rating downgrades may pose a risk to our policy transmission. Under the PEPP we are already buying Greek government bonds even though these bonds do not meet our usual minimum rating requirements. This decision reflects the unprecedented severity of this crisis. So far, we have dealt with the issue of rating downgrades only in the context of our collateral framework. We have not yet discussed the impact of potential rating downgrades on our purchase programmes.  There is a question often coming up in Germany about the danger of interest rates remaining negative for too long. You have been observing the effect this is having on banks for some time. What are your findings?   Interest rates are not under the full control of central banks. This fact is often ignored in public debates. There are fundamental macroeconomic trends that have caused a gradual but persistent fall in what we call the “natural” – or “equilibrium” – real interest rate. Monetary policy cannot reverse these broad macroeconomic trends. The implication, however, is that in order to stimulate the economy, negative rates are necessary. Raising rates would have a disastrous effect on the economy. And, overall, our conclusion is that the impact of negative rates on bank profitability is much less significant than what the discussion would suggest. There are, in fact, many other structural factors that lie within the remit of banks that weigh on bank profitability.   There is a very typical accusation that comes from Germany, and it is also in Karlsruhe’s verdict: the ECB is doing economic policy and not monetary policy.  From an academic point of view, the distinction between monetary policy and economic policy is difficult. But their objectives are clearly different. And I can assure you that the ECB is always assessing very carefully that our measures are suitable, necessary and proportionate.  Going back to a much-quoted sentence of President Christine Lagarde that caused so much discussion and also a lot of reaction in the markets, may I ask you if the ECB is there to close spreads?  The ECB has to ensure that its monetary policy reaches all parts of the euro area. A divergence of spreads is often a sign of fragmentation, and such fragmentation hampers the smooth transmission of our monetary policy. We are committed to countering such fragmentation with appropriate policy measures. And the PEPP is the right policy tool in this respect. It prevents self-reinforcing spirals and fire sales in sovereign debt markets.  Some feel now that, given the huge difference in the size of stimulus packages – Germany’s huge package is a multiple of the packages of France or Italy –, the gaps between European countries might be even bigger after the crisis.   Only very recently, Germany was accused of spending too little. So we should be happy that Germany is no longer sticking to the “black zero” during the current crisis. This will have beneficial effects for the euro area as a whole. But I agree that the point you raise in your question is important. There is a risk of an even stronger divergence in economic developments, mainly for two reasons.  First, even though this is an economic shock that has hit every country, some have been hit more strongly than others. Italy is certainly one country that has been hit particularly hard, both in terms of the human suffering and the economic consequences caused by the pandemic. Second, the fiscal capacity of individual Member States to respond to the crisis differs widely. It would be harmful if those countries that are hit the hardest spend the least to fight the crisis. Such an outcome has to be avoided. This is why an adequate European response is so important. The strong economic linkages within the euro area imply that the well-being of one country matters for all the others. So this is not only about solidarity, it is also about self-interest. We are all sitting in the same boat. If we have a leak, the entire boat will go under. We must not allow that to happen – and the best way to do this is through coordinated efforts at European level.  Italy and other countries have signed a letter insisting on coronabonds. Do you think they are right on insisting on this?  Political sensitivities are a fact of life. In Germany, but also in other countries, the concern rests mostly with the idea of debt mutualisation. This is why a “coronabond” is controversial. But my feeling is that there is a widespread willingness to find a common European response. Policymakers just have to identify the right fiscal instruments. Germany and other Northern countries believe that debt mutualisation would ultimately require shifting more decision-making powers to the European level.  You mean on fiscal policy?  Yes. If, in the medium-term and going beyond the current crisis, one wants to move towards a system with more debt mutualisation, one may also have to move towards a governance structure with more fiscal decision-making power at the European level.  On the recovery fund, there is a discussion that basically comes down to the questions if it should give credits or transfers. And countries like Italy are insisting on transfers because they can’t risk a too high debt.   There is a clear risk of a debt overhang in the aftermath of the crisis – not just in the public sector, but also in the private sector. Most public initiatives for the private sector primarily focus on loans or loan guarantees. But this approach risks undermining investment incentives in the future. So it is not clear whether responding to this crisis with debt alone is the right way to go. The European Commission has started thinking about how it could instead provide equity-type funding.  For the public sector, we will need a mixture of loans and grants to deal with the economic fallout from the crisis. And the best way to reduce the public debt burden after the crisis is to strengthen economic growth. This is the reason why the recovery fund is so important. It has to be ensured that this fund supports investments that foster economic growth in the future.  Some populists in Italy say; if we request access to the ESM, we will have the troika one day or another. How do you respond to this? And how is this linked to the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs)?  The current proposal foresees that accessing ESM funds today will not lead to an economic adjustment programme tomorrow. I fully understand that there are fears of austerity. This is certainly not what is needed at the current juncture. This has been well-understood by European leaders. As regards the link to OMTs, their use requires an ESM programme. A second important point is that there is no automatic link between a country asking for an ESM programme and the activation of OMTs. The latter is a decision by the ECB’s Governing Council. For now, we have deliberately decided to implement a new purchase programme, the PEPP, that is tailor-made for this particular type of emergency. This programme has an ample degree of embedded flexibility, and it is the right tool to deal with the current crisis. OMTs were designed for a different type of crisis, but they remain an important part of our toolbox.  A last question: there is a request for debt monetisation among certain populist parties, and this is also an argument against the ECB. Maybe it would be even stronger after Karlsruhe. How do you respond to these requests?  The Treaty does not allow for debt monetisation. The prohibition of monetary financing is an important safeguard to protect the long-term stability of the currency and the purchasing power of citizens. History teaches us that we should guard this aspect carefully. But we have to do a better job at explaining how European citizens benefit from being part of the euro area. We have eliminated exchange rate risk within the euro area, and the euro is a very successful currency: it is stable and internationally accepted. The euro also gives countries a monetary policy sovereignty that many did not have before. And the euro enjoys wide popularity in euro area countries, including in Italy. We should work hard on preserving and fostering this popularity, not only by designing the right policies, but also by explaining that the euro is beneficial for all citizens of the euro area. I am deeply committed to contributing to these objectives.   "
2020-04-21,Fabio Panetta,Why we all need a joint European fiscal response,"Contribution by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board, European Central Bank, published by Politico on 21 April 2020","   INTERVIEW 21 April 2020  Why we all need a joint European fiscal response    Contribution by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board, European Central Bank, published by Politico on 21 April 2020 The case for common European economic action in response to the coronavirus crisis has often been presented as a call for solidarity. As noble as that motivation may be, it’s not the only reason for governments to act together. A strong, symmetric fiscal response that offsets the economic damage from the pandemic is in the economic interest of all countries in the eurozone. The disadvantages of an asymmetric response are self-evident.  In the realm of public health, if countries are forced to lift necessary public health measures (e.g. lockdowns) prematurely because the economic costs of containment are too high, the virus will inevitably begin to spread again and will further damage the economy.  When it comes to the European economy, there’s a similar risk of contagion. The economies of the eurozone are tightly interlinked through supply chains, financial connections and trade relationships. As a result, a slump in a large part of the eurozone will depress growth and employment across the entire region.  These dynamics were on display a decade ago during the sovereign debt crisis, but today’s crisis exacerbates them in two ways.  First, because of the global nature of the shock, European countries cannot redirect their production to satisfy demand from the U.S. or China, as they did a decade ago. This makes member countries dependent on trade within the eurozone, which represents 45 percent of the currency area’s GDP.  Second, the amplification of the shock across supply chains will be greater this time. Eurozone firms are strongly integrated into global value chains, with participation rates 60 percent higher than for U.S. or Chinese firms. This integration is today three times tighter within the region than with the rest of the world. Analysis by the European Central Bank has found that these supply chain interlinkages will multiply the economic damage of the coronavirus lockdowns. As an illustration, we estimate that an initial GDP decline of 5 percent in major eurozone economies would turn into a 7 percent fall in output for the whole area. A GDP decline of 15 percent would provoke a 20 percent loss across the eurozone. And this only considers the recessionary phase, not the subsequent phase of weak trade if the euro area economy remains depressed. Only if all economies act with the necessary force to contain the recession will the loss in output for the entire eurozone be minimized.  Then there’s the risk of political spillovers if responses are asymmetric. Any perception that common action is absent in times of desperate crisis would dilute public support for the European Union — an effect that is already visible in countries on the frontline of the health crisis. Unchecked, these perceptions will weaken centripetal forces in the union and strengthen centrifugal ones. Ultimately, they could erode trust in the euro. So it’s clear why a forceful, symmetric European response is needed. Failure to act now will not insulate taxpayers from the costs of this crisis. Quite the opposite: it will amplify those costs when they finally come due. It will also weaken the policy responses already being undertaken. For example, without visibility on future sovereign funding costs and rollover risks, government guarantees on bank loans will either be priced differently across countries — or fewer such loans will be extended. Either way, the result will be fragmentation and a more persistent loss of economic potential.   A European fiscal response must be based around three principles. First, the size of the fiscal reaction should be proportionate to the magnitude of the shock. Second, it should not aggravate fragmentation stemming from differences in initial fiscal positions. Third, it should not skew the playing field within the European single market. Viable firms should be able to withstand this crisis no matter where in the eurozone they are located. The fiscal response of European countries has thus far been inconsistent with these principles. The countries least affected by the pandemic have enacted the largest fiscal responses, while the worst-affected countries have taken the smallest steps. This appears to be, in part, because the latter fear being unable to shoulder the debt burden that an optimal response would entail.  The threat to the single market is clear: uneven fiscal support implies that a firm’s location, rather than its business model, will be the decisive factor in determining whether it survives this crisis.  Rather than transfers between member states or a mutualisation of existing debts, what is needed now is for countries to use their collective strength to ensure that the European response is commensurate with the size of the shock and that all countries can benefit from low funding costs and zero rollover risk.  As policymakers debate the proper response, various possible funding models are being considered. These include making serious use of the eurozone’s ability to borrow and spend, using the financing capacity of the European Stability Mechanism to scale up European interventions or creating a new facility to finance the reconstruction. Whichever path is taken, the goal of fiscal policy must be to push the financing costs of this crisis far — very far — into the future. Debt that is issued at very long maturities becomes more sustainable over time as growth rates outstrip interest rates. And European issuance today will create the additional fiscal policy space needed to secure those higher growth rates in the future. An adequate European response would also facilitate the implementation of the ECB’s securities purchase programmes, increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Once the immediate emergency recedes, countries will have to deal with concerns of competitiveness and long-term sustainability, in the context of prevailing growth and interest rates. That’s an important and necessary battle, but not for today. In fact, the faster the current emergency is addressed, the faster countries will be in a position to remedy these concerns and the faster the single market will return to its normal functioning.  Acting now to create the conditions for a symmetric fiscal response will help all member countries to shorten the duration of the crisis period, protect the economic base on which their future production structures and exports rely, and — perhaps most importantly — uphold the promise of a shared and indivisible European destiny.  Eurozone countries should shoulder the cost of financing this crisis together, because they all stand to benefit by doing so.   "
2020-04-18,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Expresso,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 15 April 2020","   INTERVIEW 18 April 2020  Interview with Expresso   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 15 April 2020  Is this the greatest crisis in living memory?   According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this will be the worst downturn since the Great Depression. There is a great deal of uncertainty and, given this degree of uncertainty, we need to define and analyse several scenarios. The IMF’s baseline scenario is very similar to other public and private sector forecasts. It’s important to bear in mind that the impact on the economy, which will be huge, is concentrated in the second quarter of the year – as well as in March – and that the impact will be severe, but temporary. This temporary aspect is important. The calculations point to a contraction in the second quarter by as much as 20% compared with the previous quarter. And it will also have an impact on public finances and the financial markets.   Despite the uncertainty you have mentioned, is a rapid recovery possible in 2021?  The key factor is the duration of the lockdown – the longer it lasts, the greater the impact. We hope that the containment measures will start to be eased over the coming months, reducing the negative impact on the economy, and that we will see a return to positive growth rates in the second half of the year. But it will be hard for the recovery in the second half of 2020 and 2021 to make up for this year’s downturn.   Is the ECB’s current monetary policy sufficient to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19), or can we expect additional measures soon?   We have taken a number of key measures. In terms of monetary policy, our response to the situation has been very active, with three types of measure. First, we have provided liquidity to the banks, adjusting the rules on collateral for accessing liquidity-providing operations. European banks therefore have more liquidity at their disposal and at more favourable conditions. Second, we have responded with the measures taken by the ECB Banking Supervision. To avoid a credit crunch, we have eased the requirements on capital held by European banks, the classification of non-performing loans and the accounting rules. And third, we have launched the €750 million Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), which will increase the total assets purchased by the ECB to €1.1 trillion in 2020. This is a large sum in order to maintain financial stability in the debt markets, in particular in the government bond markets, and to safeguard the monetary policy transmission mechanisms. In addition, of course, we have the fiscal policies of national governments and the European Commission, as well as the decision by the Eurogroup last week.   Do you think that the measures adopted last week by the Eurogroup are enough to deal with the severity of the problem, or should the finance ministers have gone further? With coronabonds, for example, or similar solutions.   The agreement made was a commitment that goes in the right direction. It’s important to remember that. To reach a compromise, everyone has to give way a little and to believe in it. The agreement is a sign of political commitment. As for other possible measures, such as coronabonds, the ECB has always been in favour of the existence of a fiscal instrument at European level that can complement monetary policy. It is just that this is a political decision. We are in favour of it, we think it would be a good thing for the euro area, but we will see what happens. The European Council meets on 23 April. We consider it to be a useful instrument, but it is not up to the ECB. It’s for the European governments to decide.   And what do you expect will happen? Do you think that it’s possible to reach a political agreement to take this step towards coronabonds or is it just a dream?  I couldn't possibly say what will happen. All I can say is that the current situation is difficult and that the commitment made by the Eurogroup was positive, but let’s see. The possibility of a recovery fund being set up is a good idea. The size of the fund and how it is funded is left open to discussion. That’s why it depends on what the European governments decide.   Why did the ECB decide to launch a new programme, the PEPP, just a few days after announcing that it was strengthening the previous programme. Was your initial assessment of the situation too optimistic?   Within three or four days we saw a rapid deterioration in the situation. Containment measures were taken in several countries, and we realised that the impact on the economy could be enormous, with repercussions on the financial markets. It was a swift reaction on our part. It helped to calm the financial markets and it was well understood.   Interest rates are falling in several countries, in particular in Italy. Is this something that the ECB is concerned about?   We are concerned about a combination of problems: a deep recession, a huge impact on public finances and an increase in funding needs. This causes tension in the financial markets and, in particular, the government bond market. We are going to remain vigilant. As we have said on several occasions in the recent past, we are not going to allow any fragmentation of the bond market and we will act accordingly. We have a new instrument – the PEPP – and we can use it flexibly in terms of timing and the assets we purchase. That's why I hope we can deal with this situation.  Am I to conclude from your comments that the ECB is prepared to strengthen the programme or take other measures in order to respond to any tensions that may arise?  We have a programme that we are implementing. The ECB's Governing Council has not made any decisions regarding further programmes. We are keeping an open mind in terms of how to respond to further developments and tensions within the markets. Because we are completely committed to maintaining stability in the financial markets and to avoiding the fragmentation that could prevent the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanisms.   In countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, people are concerned that we could see another crisis, like the sovereign debt crisis in 2010-11. Can the ECB confirm that it will do all that is needed to avoid such a scenario?  We have shown our commitment, with liquidity, by making capital requirements for banks more flexible and with the asset purchase programme. We are extremely committed. The current crisis is quite different to the one we saw in 2010-11. It did not originate in budgetary issues or the banking system. It was a massive exogenous shock. This is a health emergency which has become an economic problem. Our current efforts are focused on preventing it becoming a debt crisis.  Are banks in Europe better equipped to deal with this crisis than in 2008? Or can we expect to see banks fail in various countries?  Things are very different to ten years ago. Banks have more capital, they have more liquidity and are more resilient. The bigger concern is profitability, which was already low. European banks are solvent but I am aware that this crisis will have further impact on their profitability. In the medium term, banks will need to continue to take steps to eliminate excess capacity and consolidation could be a sensible way of dealing with profitability. From a solvency angle, this is not a banking crisis. This time banks can be part of the solution, rather than the problem.   If the recession is worse than expected, is there a risk that some banks will lose money on loans which they are currently granting?  All governments, Portugal included, have approved State guarantees. When there is this level of uncertainty and a drop in GDP, these guarantees are very important and useful if a credit crunch is to be avoided.   A number of economists have expressed the view that the euro area’s response to the crisis has been weak compared to the United States or the United Kingdom, where central banks will even finance the State directly. How would you respond to these criticisms?   Looking at the whole package of ECB measures, it is impressive. Then we have fiscal policy, involving the various programmes of the national governments, and lastly there is the decision of the Eurogroup. Europe’s response is comparable to that of other world economies.   What advice would you give to euro area governments on how to deal with the economic impact of this pandemic?   We need to be aware that this will lead to a significant drop in business revenues and the public sector will need to fill this gap. The main factor in terms of ensuring the economy starts to recover when the health situation improves is to try to “vaccinate”, as best we can, the business ecosystem of each country. What we need to do is try to keep the business system alive, as much as possible, and to come through this period. That is what my advice would be. Keeping this ecosystem going is also important in terms of safeguarding jobs and reducing the social impact.    "
2020-04-12,Luis de Guindos,Interview with La Vanguardia,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Manel Pérez and published on 12 April 2020 ","   INTERVIEW 12 April 2020  Interview with La Vanguardia   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Manel Pérez and published on 12 April 2020   What is your assessment of the global economic situation in the midst of this coronavirus crisis?  The global economy will enter recession and so will the European economy, albeit an even more severe one. The ultimate fall in GDP will depend on how long the lockdown lasts. International bodies have calculated that the economy will shrink by 2% to 3% for each month of lockdown. So one and a half months would be around 5%. Three months would be double that.  Do these calculations also apply to the Spanish economy?  Spain had an advantage at the start of this crisis – it was seeing growth that was higher than the average of its euro area peers. But it also had a problem – its economy is more exposed to the crisis as it is more dependent on services like tourism, which are heavily affected by the pandemic. This makes it very likely that Spain will experience a deeper recession.  And coming out the other side of the crisis, what do you think the economic recovery will look like?  In the euro area, the most likely scenario is that we will see some signs of growth starting in the third quarter, but we will have to wait until 2021 to see a genuine recovery in economic activity. In any case, 2021 will not be able to make up for all of the downturn in 2020. I think the shape of the recovery will be somewhere between a V and a U, but we have to remember that everything will depend on the length of the economic shutdown imposed by the fight against the pandemic.  Governments are implementing active fiscal policies to stop the crisis getting worse. In Spain, business associations are complaining that the tax payment schedule has remained the same, which could lead to liquidity problems. They are calling for tax deferrals and even exemptions. What is your opinion?  First of all, it’s important to remember that the basis for the recovery will depend on successfully protecting the economy’s productive capacity. If this is achieved, economic activity will rebound more strongly. To answer your question: first you have to consider that firms will see a drastic fall in their revenue, so it’s essential that they receive relief from their tax burden. The State’s tax receipts will also fall dramatically. It’s important to come up with temporary plans to help firms, as has been done in the area of employment with the temporary layoffs [in Spanish: expedientes de regulación temporal, or ERTEs].  What is your opinion on the public loan guarantee programmes to enable the banking sector to finance firms with credit lines and loans?  They are very important, of course. All countries have put in place loan guarantees for firms. This is a good thing. But we also have to avoid the fragmentation of the Internal Market. Not all guarantees are identical. The European Investment Bank (EIB), for example, is offering a very sound shared system of guarantees. We are now seeing national guarantee schemes and we should work towards making these converge to ensure that credit continues to flow, that banks’ balance sheets remain healthy, and that we don’t see fragmentation along national lines. Although different countries will always be given different ratings by the ratings agencies.  The ECB has been very active since the beginning of this crisis. Do you think that what’s been done so far is enough?  The ECB has intervened on three levels. First, we have provided liquidity to the banks, under very good conditions, and we have launched a package of temporary collateral easing measures. In addition, in our role as the single banking supervisor, we have given banks the flexibility to make use of the capital buffers they had built up, so that they can continue financing and providing credit to firms and households. And finally, we have expanded our monetary policy operations. In 2020, asset purchases will reach €1.1 trillion (mainly of public debt) to avoid fragmentation of the euro area. Spain will receive between €120 billion and €130 billion of this money. In the current crisis, this is the main financial shield for Spain and the other euro area countries.  But countries are staring down the barrel of increasing expenditures and decreasing revenues…  Countries will experience a deep recession that will have an impact on their public finances. This will entail greater funding needs, of between €1 trillion and €1.5 trillion, an amount the likes of which we’ve probably never seen before. They will also issue public debt to finance themselves, which is precisely why the ECB’s intervention in the bond markets aims to avoid fragmentation at an extremely difficult time.  The ECB balance sheet is overflowing with debt from euro area countries. Where will this end? Is it possible that in the future this debt could be forgiven or written-off?  Debt levels in the euro area are sustainable and when this crisis is over, economic conditions will get back to normal. We are not looking at any scenarios where this debt is a problem. It’s not a scenario I’m considering.  Nevertheless, EU institutions are going through a severe crisis as they finance the cost of the pandemic. At the most recent EU summit and last Eurogroup meeting, we saw unprecedented clashes involving EU founding members, such as Italy.   Europe currently has three main instruments at its disposal. First, the EIB guarantee fund that I mentioned previously, with €25 billion made available to provide support of up to €200 billion. Second, the SURE programme [a European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency], which will provide additional lending of €100 billion to avoid job losses during the most acute phase of the crisis. And lastly, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which provides low-conditionality precautionary credit lines and already has €240 billion available, which can be increased up to €400 billion. Following the agreement the Eurogroup reached on Thursday, governments will be able to use the ESM to access the equivalent of 2% of their GDP and thus finance healthcare spending related to the pandemic.  The Eurogroup has finally reached an agreement. The ESM, which was the sticking point in the negotiations, will offer loans to finance the healthcare response of up to 2% of a country’s GDP. That aside, ESM loans continue to have the same conditions attached as they did before. Do you think this will be enough? Or will recourse to this fund go beyond that?  The funds the ESM is making available, of up to 2% of GDP to finance healthcare spending, have no additional conditions attached. For Spain, this means access to around €24 billion. In any case, the most important part of this agreement is that it represents a commitment that points in the right direction. It sends a clear signal of the willingness of the euro area countries to act together in the economic and budgetary realm. It’s also crucial because it complements, on the one hand, the fiscal stimuli launched by national governments, and on the other, the rapid and powerful intervention by the ECB since the start of this crisis. With all these measures now in play, Europe is better equipped to respond to this unprecedented crisis.  The agreement includes a generic reference to a future recovery fund that is yet to be defined. What criteria do you think it should meet?  The ECB has always stressed the need for our Economic and Monetary Union to be completed in order for the euro area to become more resilient. On the one hand, we need a European deposit insurance scheme so that savings have the same protections in every country. We’ve also called for progress in capital markets so that euro area firms have access to more sources of funding. And in the fiscal sphere, we need a shared budgetary instrument that completes the monetary union. The fund that has been proposed could go in that direction, but its size and how it is funded remain open to discussion and will depend on future decisions by governments. In any case, the determination to present a shared response is very significant, because it is a strong political signal, and also a strong signal to the markets.  Spain started the debate when it too voiced its opposition to the use of the ESM. Minister Calviño has now stated that Spain should not resort to using it and that, in any case, she only believes it is an option if conditionality is extremely low…  Before this crisis, Spain was growing, it was competitive, its debt-to-GDP ratio was below 100%, its government deficit was 2.6% and its unemployment rate stood at 14%. Currently it has been able to obtain the funding it requires on the markets, it is not experiencing any difficulties, and the spread against the German bund is 110 basis points. Let’s hope that Spain can maintain this relatively comfortable position.  Italy is not in the same position; could that be why it is adopting a more combative stance?  I don’t want to start making those kinds of comparisons.  Let’s come back to Spain then. There is talk of making a political pact, like the Moncloa Pacts of 1977. What’s your opinion? Are you in favour of pacts?  I think we must always be in favour of political pacts during extraordinary times such as these. Although a comparison with the 1977 Moncloa Pacts is perhaps not possible. At that time, Spain was not a member of the EU and the euro did not exist. The main goal was to reduce inflation and change the income policy. Today, there is a deep recession that will have a very severe impact on the public finances and which will require a huge effort to get the economy back to normal. This is the most serious economic situation since the Civil War.  Some are also calling for a government of national unity…  I am simply suggesting that joint action by consensus would be the best approach to take for the Spanish economy. It is up to the elected representatives to decide on whether or not the best approach, within a framework of understanding, is to make an explicit pact or establish a certain type of government.  What conditions are required to reach an understanding of this nature?  I think the important thing is to establish a framework of mutual trust and loyalty between the government and the opposition; and that is a two-way street.  Banks are in a difficult position: at a time when they still have not restored their business models after years of low interest rates, the current scenario has again been prolonged indefinitely. How do you think this will affect the sector?  The banking sector is facing this situation from a much more robust position than ten years ago. It is true that it has profitability issues and the deep recession will affect its bottom line. But there are no solvency problems. The financial markets experienced some problems during the initial days of this crisis, but they were not caused by the banking sector. The situation has to a certain extent returned to normal, although not completely, while prices have partially recovered and volatility has eased.  Yes, to a large extent, the current situation already existed, and in theory mergers offered a solution, but these mergers have not taken place…  Well, in Spain there has actually been some banking consolidation, which has reinforced the system’s robustness. And there will now be more pressure in Europe in relation to the falling profitability conditions I mentioned before.   "
2020-04-09,Christine Lagarde,Interview with France Inter,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Ali Baddou and Carine Bécard on 9 April 2020","   INTERVIEW 9 April 2020  Interview with France Inter   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Ali Baddou and Carine Bécard on 9 April 2020  Thank you for speaking with us this morning from your office at the ECB in Frankfurt. There is a risk that Europe and the world are facing the worst economic crisis since the Second World War. France has gone into recession. Its GDP is expected to have contracted by 6% in the first quarter, a level not seen for 75 years. Two weeks of lockdown have wiped out five years of growth. You have described the current crisis in terms of a shock. Doesn’t that seem an understatement today?  This is first of all a human tragedy. It is first and foremost a pandemic, a terrible health crisis affecting all the countries of the world one after the other and putting strain and pressure on our healthcare systems and all those committed to providing care for us, in a terribly risky environment. So first and foremost my thoughts are with them and with those who are suffering and those who are fearful.  And with the sick.  Of course…  And what of the economic and social situation we face?  This terrible health crisis will clearly inflict very severe damage on all the world’s economies, the euro area economies and France. The situation is unprecedented in recent history. And, to give you an analogy, it’s a bit like an athlete who has to suddenly stop training under normal conditions and consequently sees their muscles gradually atrophy. It’s a somewhat similar story for economies when they are required to put a large part of their activities on hold. I am very mindful of the fact that many of our compatriots particularly are working in hospitals and supermarkets and in roles that are vital to enable the country to keep going. But there is a whole part of the economy which is like the athlete who is required to stay at home. The task now is to keep doing some training so the muscles do not atrophy and so as not to be too weak but to be able to come back stronger than ever once it’s possible to start again.  You are going to tell us what you are doing to simultaneously help firms, households and the different countries. But to continue your metaphor of an athlete or jogger, it will certainly be very hard to restart the economy. In your view, how long will the economy remain shut down?  That will depend entirely on the lockdown measures to be decided by the political authorities in consultation with the scientific committees that advise them. What is certain and quite clear is that the longer this period lasts and the longer the weeks of lockdown continue, the greater the resulting economic damage will be; restarting will clearly be hard for certain sectors while for others it will be faster, but the precise conditions for restarting are rather uncertain. There was a time when it was said that the reboot would happen very quickly and very strongly. I am a bit dubious because I think that there are some sectors of the economy that will reboot very quickly and very strongly while other sectors will be much slower to reboot.  Clearly this will be further discussed.  To give you a rather simplistic idea, every month of lockdown costs between two and three percentage points of GDP per annum. This means that for every month of lockdown the French economy and the economies of the euro area contract by 2% to 3% annually. So the longer this lasts, the bigger the economic contraction will be.  So then, in what terms should this crisis be described? This morning Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the former President of the European Commission, said in the newspaper Libération that this crisis will be less painful and less dangerous than the crisis in 2008 that you well know. Do you agree with him?  I would very much like to believe that, but I am not convinced. I think that this is a very severe crisis, which is temporary, but which will inflict damage on our economies that will probably affect certain sectors deeply and it will take time to recover from it. Let’s be clear, it took time to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, especially because it was subsequently prolonged by a European sovereign debt crisis. In this current crisis, the speed of recovery will depend on two factors: how long the economy is shut down, or partially shut down, and the measures taken to keep the athlete fit to start racing again afterwards. There are many measures being taken currently: both at the monetary level – which is the remit of the European Central Bank and the 19 national central banks of the Eurosystem – and then there are the fiscal tools, which are implemented by governments. And the two must go hand in hand in order to succeed in supporting jobs, through partial unemployment in most euro area countries and through the liquidity that we are pouring into the economy so the banks can continue to lend and to support firms so they can remain operational. The more effective these measures are, the fitter the athlete will be to come back and continue the race when it’s possible to go out again.  But for how long is this sustainable? When the talk was of unemployment and partial unemployment funded by the State, deferral of taxes and social security contributions, and grants aimed at self-employed persons. In France for example, how long is such a situation sustainable for our country, seeing how much it costs per month?  It will have to continue for as long as necessary. If lockdown has to remain in place for two months, partial unemployment must be able to support workers for two months and firms must be able to continue benefiting from financing for two months. I compare what the ECB and the 19 national central banks are doing to what a shield does. It is imperative to protect the economy that is partially on standby. If this isn’t done, the consequences afterwards will be disastrous. So it is absolutely essential to succeed in keeping the economy that is on standby ready to start operating quickly once it is rebooted. And let’s be clear, there is going to be an afterwards; the lockdown will not last forever. There will be vaccines; there will be probable gradual and sequential lifting of lockdowns, because not all countries are all affected at the same time. Close coordination will be needed to do this, because a second and a third wave must, of course, be prevented. But don’t imagine that the current state of affairs is going to be permanent.  Should help only be given to firms that have a chance of surviving the crisis? Should all efforts be focussed rather on those that will be able to reboot, or should help be given to absolutely all firms, large and small?  It is first necessary to look into the situation of the firms that are weakest and most vulnerable. Not because they were badly managed and on the verge of bankruptcy, but because they often find it harder to access credit. And here I am thinking in particular of small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed persons. This is also why the ECB decided very recently together with all the 19 national central banks of the euro area, to accept collateral, , with no lower limit. Previously loans above a certain threshold were taken. Here we are saying that all loans to households, self-employed persons and SMEs and large enterprises, are all accepted for ECB refinancing. The focus is on small and medium-sized enterprises. The new long term and targeted refinancing operations which will reach its full scope from the start of June – represents about €3,000 billion of liquidity. This financing will be targeted particularly at small and medium-sized enterprises.  To relaunch this economic engine, it is clearly understood that every country’s debts will soar. How long will countries have to recover and to repay their debts?  You are right to ask that question because the timeframe will be crucial. Upon returning to growth after the crisis, to immediately tighten fiscal policies and put the brakes on growth would mean falling back into a pitfall that must absolutely be avoided. Debt repayment should be carried out progressively over time and the economy should be put back on a path that is more stable and more favourable for public finances. It should not be done abruptly.  But what does that mean? Two years, three years or five years?  No, it will take much longer than that…  Ten years?  Much longer, because some euro area countries will see a significant increase in their level of indebtedness., If you look at the levels that the euro area countries are going to take on, we are talking today of around 19% of GDP. So this debt repayment must necessarily take a long time. It’s normal..  Is it totally unthinkable and inconceivable to have a global measure to cancel these debts?  To me it seems totally unthinkable. First, this is not the time to be asking about cancellation. Right now we are concentrating on keeping the economy in a fit state to function once things improve. Then the question will be how to rebuild, how the athlete can regain muscle and be helped to run at their best. That will be the time for reconstruction. The question then will be repaying the debt and how to manage public finances as effectively as possible.  Yes, because it is the people who will pay the price anyway. When the question is asked of who will ultimately pay, it will be the people, the citizens of Europe, which means, as seen in past years, taxes and austerity measures. And for now that is a question that is being asked but has not been settled among the Eurogroup countries and that is a genuine political question. Whether the rich countries of northern Europe will help the poorer countries in the south, that is a choice that will have profound consequences for the future of the Union. Who will decide at the end of the day?  Today, the priority is the coordination effort to manage the present situation, the huge crisis that greatly affects us all. What I notice today – particularly within the Eurogroup – is that while there are some difficult issues, there are long discussions and this is not surprising. Some progress is being made little by little in the course of these discussions. France plays a very decisive role in this regard. I believe that this coordination, this effort - which is at once both temporary and very targeted - must also be applied when exiting from the crisis. If when exiting, it’s everyone for themselves, it is not going to work in the best way, that’s clear.  Discussions with France Inter listeners   On the one hand, the ECB has taken a large number of measures: the billions of euro in liquidity which you mentioned earlier and the purchase of securities. On the other hand, the “mutualisation” of costs resulting from the various health measures which have been taken, namely ""coronabonds"" which have divided European countries between the north and the south. You yourself have called for an end to the “everyone for themselves” attitude. Can we expect joint measures from Europe as a community or does this crisis bring out the “everyone for themselves” attitude?  Speaking as an optimist, I would hope that this coordinated effort, this sense of a collective which is now emerging - including within the Eurogroup - will be able to continue afterwards. I do believe that reconstruction will be a decisive moment. Having attended meetings of finance ministers myself, I can tell you that an incredible amount of progress has already been made. The idea that there could be a joint recovery fund, financed on a collective basis, in other words where all parties – the good and the less good – come together would be fantastic. I cannot be sure whether we have reached that point yet, but we are moving in that direction.  You are using the conditional tense – you are very familiar with the never-ending meetings of the Eurogroup and the finance ministers, having often been in attendance yourself. However, at the moment, division rather than solidarity is predominant. How would you respond to Jacques Delors’ comment that the lack of solidarity constitutes a “mortal danger” to the European Union? Could it be said that the EU’s current way of working is an indicator that it is in mortal danger?  The main source of “mortal danger “ is currently the coronavirus…  Yes, of course. but that is the image actually used by the former President of the European Commission…  Yes, I know. Clearly, the duty of solidarity must be complied with, and this solidarity needs to take the shape of concrete action. For example, when I see Germany offering hospital beds and taking on patients from the Grand-Est region of France, it may not be, for some observers, the great gesture of financial solidarity that is expected, but it shows solidarity nevertheless. We need to gather together all of these signs and move towards providing support to those countries most at risk and most affected today, namely Italy and Spain, within the euro area, of course. I do believe progress is being made. But as you know, Europe is a form of mosaic of different temperaments, cultures, histories and taboos…  Of national self-interest, as well...  We are all in a situation where everyone needs to be on board. Whether that be people sensibly staying at home, or others doing their utmost in hospitals, or people trying to invent new policies, everyone must be on the front line. We all have something to contribute. All of the tools at our disposal need to be mobilised. For some people, it is hard to come around. This disease is spreading and affecting everyone and we all need to ask: are we all working together? And of course, the answer must be yes.   Are some countries facing bankruptcy? I am referring, primarily, to Greece which is not much talked about. There is much more talk of Italy these days. But is it not possible that Greece, which has taken a long time to recover, might simply fall once again, only much lower and much harder?  First, thanks to programmes implemented since 2010, Greece is currently in a solid situation in terms of its financing needs. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, the European Central Bank acts as a shield to protect the euro area. My job - in conjunction with the 19 other governors of central banks within the euro area- is to ensure price stability – that is our primary role. But above all, our job is to ensure that monetary policy is implemented smoothly across the entire euro area. Therefore, as soon as we see a risk, as soon as we see tension, we will take action. We will take action to prevent that risk from coming into being, because that is what our role is.  France has often come under fire for its tax and social security contributions which exceed 48%. We can now see that , given its social protection system, France is able to cushion the crisis as regards health and social security (…). I would be interested to hear your view on how relevant the French system is in terms of the protection it offers. On that note my congratulations also to all of the country’s Caisses des Allocations Familiales (Family Allowance Funds) which have managed to issue payments to 13 million families under extraordinary circumstances...  We are right to celebrate all these heroes, who are all, each in their own places and roles, doing everything they can to help. On the subject of social protection, I believe that, as we emerge from the crisis, we will indeed question the relevance and effectiveness of systems which are relatively similar across all of the euro area countries.  I think the real comparison will be made with a social protection model such as that which exists in the United States, where the health situation will clearly be much more concerning and the situation facing the unemployed much more worrying.  We will likely see a number of useful changes in terms of values, the system in which we operate and how best to manage it. And from this point of view, I think that the euro area has a very important part to play in this area.  Let’s take partial unemployment as an example. We have learned a lot from Germany’s system of ""Kurzarbeit"", their equivalent of partial unemployment. When the 2008-09 crisis hit, workers could still remain employed, at slightly lower pay. We learned a great deal. Partial unemployment, as it exists in France, also serves as a benchmark for a number of other countries. The current social protection system in the euro area is therefore clearly fulfilling its role as a safety net for many families and employees.  That is reassuring and since you mentioned the idea of a change of model, are you looking ahead to the future, while we still in the midst of a crisis? Should Europe take advantage of the current situation in order to speed up, for example, energy transition? Should help for businesses be subject to them implementing ecological change?  I think we should help companies, families and workers.   All companies?  As I mentioned before, we need to make sure that the economy is on standby, and protected and can be resumed so that training can restart under normal circumstances. That is our number one priority. What is absolutely vital – and this has been decided by Europeans together and advocated by the European Commission under the authority of President von der Leyen – is to move towards ""green"" growth. The way in which we failed to respect biodiversity, the way in which we have not sufficiently respected our environment, is coming back to us like a boomerang. It is not at all surprising that the origin of this disease comes from animals and is linked to the transmission of this virus from animals to humans.  Reconstructing differently will take time. Do we have time to do that?  We will need to move as fast as we can, but we will of course have to manage it over time. There are objectives which have been set for 2030 and we will have to make efforts to achieve them. But I think that we will be, at the EU level, in a position to re-examine a whole series of principles, relating to European autonomy, supply chains, values, pricing, and so on.  You stated that solidarity should take the form of concrete action. Personally I notice people around me who find themselves without any income at all. In the light of Spain's decision to establish a universal basic income, do you think a step of this kind could be envisaged at the European level, in order to end lockdown more easily and with more resources?  A mechanism for dealing with unemployment at the European level is precisely what is on the agenda and what will be discussed by the finance ministers in the Eurogroup. For some countries this will simply involve an enhancement, while for others it will be an essential mechanism that perhaps does not yet exist. In terms of a universal social floor at the EU level, this is a precursor for other future developments. It is alos a way for Europeans to borrow on a joint basis…  Is this is the end of globalisation as we know it, as it has taken shape over the last few decades?  I think the globalisation that we have seen over the last 30 years was already starting to be called into question. It will continue to be, probably involving a redefinition of priorities and greater autonomy within Europe.  And relocation?  If not that, then at least greater control over our supply chains; perhaps relocation for a number of products considered to be vital and priority products. It is up to our societies, together, to define what our common choices and our future will be.  Could the euro lose its value? Could the inflation which is expected lead to prices increasing a little? Should we be concerned about our savings?  Could the euro lose its value? It is stable; we are in a floating exchange rate system and looking at that indicator, things are going well. The second question was about inflation. We would like to have a little more of it...  Increased prices would not be welcome by many consumers....  I know … but in any case it's not a major risk on the horizon, although I'd like to see a little more of it. As regards savings, we should bear in mind, in any case, that we have a protection scheme covering €100,000 for all bank accounts within the euro area. And banks today are much stronger than they were in 2008…  So we shouldn’t be concerned about savings with banks?  No.  Thank you for clarifying that issue and for answering our questions.  Thank you very much.   "
2020-04-08,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Le Parisien,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Matthieu Pelloli and published on 9 April 2020","   INTERVIEW 8 April 2020  Interview with Le Parisien   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Matthieu Pelloli and published on 9 April 2020  From Emmanuel Macron’s repeated references to “war” to Queen Elizabeth II invoking the spirit of the Blitz, memories of the darkest hours in our history are resurfacing. Are we in effect facing a war?   There are probably points of comparison. What is certain is that an invisible enemy is severely testing our healthcare systems and our extraordinary healthcare workers. And that same enemy is putting the global economy under strain. Our way of life has been altered, and for some it has been turned completely upside down.  You were Minister of the Economy in 2008, at the time of the last global economic crisis. How does the current crisis differ from the previous one?   The origins of the 2008 crisis were financial. The current crisis is, in the first instance, a healthcare crisis. If you think about it, it can also be traced back to the ecological and biological chaos of the world. In some ways, it’s the revenge of the living! The economic consequences are difficult to quantify, but they will certainly be severe. Today, it’s not a question of stimulating the economy, as we did in 2008, but of putting it on hold for the time needed to contain the virus in order to pave the way for a fast and functional recovery.   In 2008 multilateralism played a decisive role. Is that conceivable now, with heads of state like Boris Johnson, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro?  The spread of the virus, and its ruthless and indiscriminate nature, will hopefully serve as a reminder to commentators who believe multilateralism belongs to the 1950s that it in fact has many virtues. We need it now to help us manage the response, and we will need it later to organise our exit from the crisis. Just imagine that China, the European Union and the United States were back on their feet, but that the entire southern hemisphere, from South America to Africa, had then been hit by the virus. We wouldn’t be that much better off, facing the risk of a second wave.  You have said that you fear a “considerable” recession in the euro area. Of what magnitude?  In 2009 growth contracted by 4.5% in the euro area and by 2.9% in France. The consensus view of economists on the current crisis is that each month of lockdown will mean a loss of 2% to 3% of annual growth in 2020. That would imply a fall in GDP of 3.5% to 4% in a scenario where the lockdown lasts a few weeks, and of 9% to 10% in the event of a longer lockdown lasting several months. But I would caution that these are just estimates!   Are EU countries responding adequately?   They have quickly taken far-reaching measures, increasing fiscal spending and providing support for employees and businesses. The EU has granted countries maximum flexibility in terms of both deficits and debt ratios. We are in a period where we need to use all of our tools without hesitation. Having fully recognised this, Germany, although very attached to its balanced budget principle, has temporarily relinquished its zero deficit policy.  But if debt soars, could certain European countries default? Is there a risk of a domino effect? No. The euro area’s architecture has been strengthened precisely to address that fragmentation risk. In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) is there; it has its entire toolbox at its disposal and it will provide the necessary shield to protect the euro area. Before March, people said to me, “The toolbox is empty, you have nothing left, you can’t use the monetary weapon” – and then we did!  The “bazooka” used by the ECB consists of a fund of €750 billion. How does it work?   Our new asset-buying programme enables us to respond to an enormous shock which would otherwise risk undermining price stability. It consists of a large envelope for the purchase of public and private sector securities, including corporate bonds and commercial paper.  We are a bit like a control tower: we intervene where there is a risk of fragmentation. Altogether, we have more than €1,000 billion of firepower at our disposal to support financing conditions, and thus companies and jobs.  At the same time, we can mobilise €3,000 billion of liquidity. Today, if a bank extends a loan, whether it is to someone who is self-employed, a small business, a small or medium-sized enterprise or a large company, it can bring those loans to us as collateral and say, “Here you go, I need funding”. And the funding is there, at very favourable rates.  Donald Trump has implemented plans involving USD 2,200 billion of support for the economy. Are the efforts made by the EU sufficient?   That sum of USD 2,200 billion should be compared with the fiscal measures taken by the 19 countries of the euro area, which are at least as sizeable, amounting to around €2,350 billion if all government pledges are taken into account, which represents 19% of euro area GDP. They consist of measures to provide direct support to households and firms, amounting to 3% of GDP, and of government credit guarantees representing 16% of euro area GDP. And on top of this, we also have the effects of the “automatic stabilisers”, which, as everyone knows, are considerably larger in Europe than they are in the United States.  But who will ultimately foot the bill?  There’s no such thing as a free lunch, as they say. We Europeans will eventually have to repay this money… But instead of looking at the bill, let’s first think about why we’re doing what we’re doing. It’s to support the economy, to preserve jobs, so that people who have a job can receive short-time working benefits… If we manage the crisis recovery appropriately, we will return to growth which, over time, will enable the new debt to be repaid.  Are other options available to you if the situation gets worse?  Yes, but I won’t tell you what they are, because – let’s face it – their impact will partly rely on an element of surprise. But I can assure you: there are no limits to our commitment to the euro area. The ECB will be able to develop its tools and use them in the most appropriate way to fulfil its mandate.  The creation of “coronabonds”, through which Europeans would share the debt linked to the crisis, is a bone of contention. Does that worry you?  First of all, a form of debt mutualisation is already in place today, through the European Stability Mechanism, the European Investment Bank and the European Union’s own borrowing. And I don’t think there should be such a fixation on “coronabonds”. In Europe, things take a little longer than one would like, but we always end up finding a solution. I’m not surprised that the issue can’t be resolved overnight during a Eurogroup meeting [Editor’s note: the meeting of EU finance ministers], and the ECB is fortunately there to provide, within its mandate, the protective shield that is needed for this type of project to come to fruition.  While we’re talking about solidarity, I also want to highlight what Germany is doing to help the Grand Est region of France, by admitting French patients to its hospitals. People are really helping each other out, and we should celebrate that. “Coronabonds” are one expression of European solidarity, but there are others, too.  For example?  I’m thinking of shared spending within the framework of a European budget specifically for the recovery from this crisis. And of the launch of a reconstruction fund targeting growth that is greener and more digitally-oriented. These tools would enable us to show the necessary solidarity towards the EU countries that are currently suffering the most.  Does this crisis call for a rethink on globalisation?   The reappraisal preceded the crisis, but it has become more acute and is leading us to reconsider our way of life. I hope that multilateralism will come out of this stronger, not weaker. I think that we will shift towards relocations and shorter supply chains, as well as towards a reflection on value and fair prices.   What do you understand by “fair prices”: will the cost of living be higher in the post-crisis world?   Not all products will be more expensive. But our hope at present is that we will no longer be dependent for our supplies, in respect of medicines for example. That would inevitably push up prices. There will be an impact from the relocation to France of production chains that now benefit from extremely low production costs in Asia, where labour is cheap. But we need to make choices!   Shouldn’t competition rules be reviewed in order to speed up the emergence of European giants that would be able to ensure our autonomy in other strategic sectors?   Yes, definitely. Indeed, I believe that the exemptions to state aid rules that are now being implemented will accelerate this review. It’s a topic that the Commission is already working on …  You were formerly Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. Should it use its special drawing rights (SDR), a kind of currency created by the IMF, to support states? Should it reduce the debt burden on low-income countries?   That is a decision for the IMF, but both initiatives seem to me to be a completely valid way of dealing with the situation of developing countries.   Our compatriots are concerned about the solidity of European banks in general and that of French banks in particular. Many readers are wondering if their savings are safe? Are they safe?   European banks are much stronger than they were in 2008. Their capital ratios have practically doubled. Their regulatory framework has been strengthened and their supervisors are far more vigilant and scrupulous than they were back then. The banking sector is as strong as one could wish for. Savers can rest assured.    "
2020-04-04,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with To Vima,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Angelos Athanasopoulos and published on 4 April 2020","   INTERVIEW 4 April 2020  Interview with To Vima   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Angelos Athanasopoulos and published on 4 April 2020  The ECB recently decided to unleash its firepower once more to protect the euro area economy. The introduction of the €750 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) is the latest in a series of measures, with the ECB having already announced an additional envelope for its asset purchase programme of €120 billion in net purchases until the end of 2020, on top of the monthly net asset purchases of €20 billion. Why was an ad hoc, temporary programme like the PEPP needed?   The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a humanitarian crisis, and has put enormous strain on the euro area economy and the financial sector. Over the past few weeks, the outlook for the economy deteriorated sharply as countries had to intensify containment measures, dampening both production and consumption. This posed downside risks to the inflation outlook in the euro area. We also observed a sharp tightening of financial conditions at a time when the economy needed support. Signs of financial fragmentation were re-emerging, impairing the transmission of our policy. We responded forcefully to this deterioration in the economic outlook by launching a new temporary asset purchase programme, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which also includes purchases of Greek government bonds. This helps stabilise financial markets, and contributes to much more favourable financing conditions, not least in Greece, where interest rate spreads have dropped markedly.  What are the main characteristics of the PEPP? Would you say that it is different from a typical monetary quantitative easing (QE) programme? If so, what are the differences?    Our existing asset purchase programme (APP) was designed for normal times, providing monetary policy accommodation in order to support the gradual return of inflation to our aim. The PEPP is a separate programme. It is our response to the extraordinary economic shock caused by the pandemic. The PEPP is temporary, significant in size, and flexible. We expect it to run until we judge that the current crisis is over, but at least until the end of the year.  One of the key aspects of the PEPP is its flexibility. How do you respond to those who say that the ECB should not raise the issue limit of 33% when buying bonds? Could this raise legal questions in the future?  The ECB has made it clear that, within its mandate, it will do everything needed in order to safeguard the full transmission of its monetary policy in all euro area countries. The PEPP allows purchases to be conducted flexibly over time and across asset classes and jurisdictions.  The Governing Council has explicitly communicated that, if necessary and proportionate to the extraordinary risks that we are facing due to the coronavirus crisis, it will consider revising any self-imposed limits, including the issue share and issuer limits, in line with our legal framework. This flexibility makes the PEPP a highly effective instrument to ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy and to avoid fragmentation across euro area countries.  The ECB granted a waiver which allows it to purchase Greek bonds under the PEPP. What does this move signal to the markets? How important is this development, and could it later open the door to Greece participating in the normal asset purchase programme?  Greece has made impressive progress in recent years, after many years of economic and social hardship. The economy was on an encouraging trajectory before the pandemic, and the Greek authorities have responded decisively to the health crisis. By including Greek bonds in the PEPP, the ECB is sending a clear signal to markets that this crisis affects the entire euro area, and that it will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in any euro area country. The ECB will do everything that is necessary to fulfil its mandate and support the euro area and its citizens through this historic crisis.  If Greece is included in an enhanced conditions credit line (ECCL) programme, along the lines described in Eurogroup President Mario Centeno’s recent letter to the European Council, would it then be eligible for the public sector purchase programme (PSPP)?  Greece does not yet satisfy the minimum rating requirement for eligibility for outright purchases under the PSPP. Under certain conditions, a waiver to these requirements can be granted. It also depends on political decisions and on the specific features of any potential credit line instrument that is being considered by the relevant European institutions, including the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).   The PEPP also allows for the purchase of corporate bonds. What is the situation for Greek corporate bonds? Are they included in the PEPP? Can they be included in the future?  In principle, non-financial corporate bonds issued in any euro area country, including Greece, can be included in the PEPP if they meet the relevant eligibility requirements, including the minimum rating threshold. For the time being, no Greek corporate bonds qualify. But I hope that this will change in the future.  Over the past decade, prudential issues such as non-performing loans (NPLs) have been very challenging to deal with. NPLs have been one of the main structural problems in the Greek banking sector, preventing investment and growth in the Greek economy. As the euro area economy is heading towards a recession, which could prove long and deep, a new generation of NPLs could appear – and not only in Greece. How is the ECB planning to deal with such a contingency? Will the plans put in place to deal with the current challenge of NPLs be enough when the coronavirus crisis comes to an end?   The crisis will certainly have negative effects on bank balance sheets. But this time, banks are not the cause of the crisis; they rather have to be part of the solution. And they are in much better shape now, with more capital and a better liquidity position. The supervisory arm of the ECB has implemented significant measures to allow banks to continue to provide funding to firms and households. ECB Banking Supervision has communicated to banks that it will use maximum flexibility in evaluating the progress of ongoing plans to reduce past NPLs. It is important that we find the right balance between helping banks absorb the impact of the current downturn and identifying risks, deploy sustainable solutions for viable distressed debtors. Only a strong, but at the same time sufficiently flexible, banking system is able to meet the financing needs of people and businesses.  Christine Lagarde has mentioned that aside from what the ECB can and will do, the Member States of the euro area should assume their responsibilities on the fiscal side. The ESM is exploring various options towards that end, although differences among Member States remain. Would the ECB consider eurobonds in the form of “coronabonds” as a proper way forward in order for the euro area economy to counter the economic impact of the virus? And could urgent circumstances lead to the activation of the “OMT bazooka” being delinked from an ECCL programme?   These are political decisions, which are not within the ECB’s remit. That being said, there is clearly a need to provide European-level support to those euro area countries hit most by the crisis. This is not just a question of European solidarity, but also makes sense from an economic standpoint. Mitigating the negative economic effects of the crisis in each Member State and supporting the recovery afterwards makes the whole of Europe stronger. The issuance of one-off “coronabonds” is one possibility. There are other instruments that could be used, like an EU rescue fund or measures involving the ESM or the European Investment Bank. In the current crisis, the PEPP is the right instrument to support the euro area on the monetary policy side. Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) were designed to address a different contingency: the risk that the expectations of a euro area break-up might become self-fulfilling. OMTs remain an essential element of our policy toolkit, but they are not the most suitable instrument to counter the current crisis.   "
2020-03-30,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Cadena COPE,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Carlos Herrera on 30 March 2020","   INTERVIEW 30 March 2020  Interview with Cadena COPE   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Carlos Herrera on 30 March 2020  Are you teleworking? Are you in lockdown?  Yes, we’re in lockdown and have been teleworking for almost a month now.  I’d like to go back in time. You were in a very difficult place at an extremely difficult time, i.e. at the helm of the Spanish economy when the crisis that was triggered between 2007 and 2008 reached its peak and Mario Draghi uttered the magic words “…whatever it takes…”, which significantly calmed the markets. Can today’s crisis, which is different in nature but devastating nonetheless, also be solved by either you or your President saying “we will do whatever is necessary”, and that will solve everything?  We are already doing whatever is necessary. We have given banks as much liquidity as they need and the ECB is going to buy more than a trillion euros’ worth of euro area bonds. Spain will benefit to the tune of around €120 billion. This is the Spanish economy’s main line of defence from a financial perspective at the moment.  Is this how much Spanish banks, with the government’s approval, will be able to grant in terms of loans to whoever asks for them?  No, these are direct purchases made by the European Central Bank.  Purchases of debt, of bonds?  Exactly.  Does this mean money for the government?  Yes, ultimately. The purchases are made on the secondary market, but will also have an impact on the primary market. The ECB is taking steps to help avoid certain situations; do you remember what happened with the spread?  Yes, it reached 650 points in Spain.  The aim is to ensure spreads don’t widen dramatically and to keep the borrowing costs of governments under control to avoid an increase in financial stress at this extremely challenging time.  Are you now sure we will be in recession at the end of this quarter?  Yes. All of the scenarios being looked at, by the European Commission, the OECD, etc. indicate that a recession will take hold. The main question is how long the lockdown period will last. If it lasts a long time, each month will see a fall of approximately two percentage points in GDP, according to the OECD calculations. If it lasts for three months, we would see a fall of six percentage points. These are fairly reliable calculations.  What do you think of the government’s “I order, you foot the bill” approach? Meaning that employers cannot lay anyone off but have to keep paying; maintain their expenditure while receiving no income. Could this result in the destruction of Spain’s, and possibly other countries’, business infrastructure?  I mustn’t get into analysing specific policies. The Spanish government has taken a decision to introduce stricter lockdown measures in the hope that this will in fact help to shorten the pandemic’s life cycle and break the chain of infection. Ultimately, although this will come at a certain cost, hopefully it will be outweighed by the benefits. This public health crisis will lead to a very severe recession. The assumption is that businesses will stop billing. And what we must do is try to keep as many of our businesses as possible afloat so that, after a certain period, economic activity can bounce back again. When companies stop billing, measures should be taken to try and keep their expenditure to a minimum. If their expenditure is fixed at a certain level, the only way out is for businesses to go bust. And that is what we must avoid.  The Spanish government – I don't know about other European governments – is providing guarantees for loans to continue paying, but it’s not helping businesses with a moratorium on labour costs or on certain taxes.  The issue of guarantees is a crucial one. The ECB has provided lots of liquidity to the banks. The banks have to pass this liquidity on to customers, namely SMEs and the self-employed. So guarantees are important. We also need to allow tax liabilities, social security payments and the like to be deferred. What’s important is that businesses that were entirely profitable before the start of the pandemic survive it and become profitable again once it’s over. That goes for Spain and for all the countries in the euro area.  Are the €120 billion of debt purchases kind of like the coronabonds that people are calling for? Or is this something different?  No, this is completely different. It’s direct intervention by the ECB. I’m in favour of coronabonds; I think they show solidarity.  What would coronabonds involve?  Coronabonds would be mutualised debt issuance by the entire euro area. They wouldn’t be bonds issued by Spain, Italy or Germany, but by an EU institution. But this isn’t the only instrument we can use to defend [against the effects of the coronavirus], and it’s certainly not the most powerful. The most powerful is undoubtedly the European Central Bank, which is dealing with a situation, in which also some countries with weaker fiscal positions require funding, so that we don’t see an emergence of the bond spread problem and an increase in borrowing costs.  In the 2008 crisis you were looking far ahead. Everything came together in that moment during the euro crisis. Four years went by before we could start to breathe freely. This time it’s a virus which, perhaps within a month, has been brought under control in one way or another. Or in two months we might be able to breathe freely again. But never before has so much damage been done in two months. Are the consequences this time going to be worse than back then?  We will have to see. If this goes on for two months, there will be a recession but it won't be an overly deep one. If we get to three months, it will start to become more serious. I think it’s important to bear in mind that, from the economic perspective, Europe remains the main economic and financial shield for an economy like Spain’s in times like these, in an emergency like the one we’re in now. If we didn’t have a central bank like the ECB acting in the interests of the entire euro area – and in the interests of the Spanish economy – the funding costs of the Spanish economy would be soaring. In a situation like the one we’re in, imagine adding a debt crisis to the public health crisis and the economic crisis. That’s what the ECB is preventing. So there’s a significant element of solidarity to this. And other things are being done too. For example, the European Investment Bank is going to launch a guarantee scheme. The EU budgets will start working and making purchases. The EU institutions are acting in solidarity with all of the countries, also those that are most vulnerable, like Spain at the moment.  Nevertheless, the Spanish government is furious. When the Spanish Prime Minister talks about Europe, especially about Germany and the Netherlands who are putting obstacles in the way of the notorious coronabonds, he looks stony-faced. Sometimes, situations like this are used somewhat irresponsibly to stir up Euroscepticism.  I’m not going to discuss specific topics, I will just give you the data. Currently, the ECB is clearly the principal calming influence in the financial markets, with the €750 billion of bond purchases that we recently approved, plus the €120 billion we approved shortly before that, plus the €240 billion we were already doing. This is ensuring that the cost of public debt, not just for Spain but also for other countries, does not increase dramatically and that the issue of bond spreads does not rear its head again.  Take a country with a debt level of 98% [of GDP], like Spain (not the highest in Europe, some other countries’ debt levels are even higher). How many years will it take to pay off this debt increase?  Budgets will deteriorate significantly, mainly because tax revenues will collapse. It remains to be seen who will be paying corporation tax, or VAT, or income tax, or social security contributions. But we all hope that this situation, this catastrophe, will be temporary. We’re talking about two or three months. There will be an increase in debt. But what’s important is that, after this period is over, we get back on our feet and the Spanish economy begins generating activity and employment again, as it was before. This is very much the hope.   I wanted to ask you whether some of the southern European countries, and Spain in particular, could once again be looking at a rescue scenario in the medium term.  No. This is completely different from what happened in 2008, 2009 and 2010. This is a shock that is affecting everyone – the plans enacted in 2009 and 2010 cannot be applied to the current situation.  Almost all the letters of the alphabet have been used to describe the type of recovery we might see: V-shaped, L-shaped, U-shaped… What will it be? And what is your opinion on essential industries being paralysed? The accusation levelled at us by northern European countries is that Spain has squandered the opportunity to reduce its deficit during a growth period, and now we’re paying the price.  Spain reduced its deficit. In 2011 we had a government deficit of 9.6% and we reduced it to 2.5%. We have a high level of debt, close to 100% [of GDP]. Spain has acted responsibly, also from the point of view of its banking sector, which is not currently a cause for concern. The sector was successfully restructured. And Spain is a very competitive country – the external sector is the main source of growth in the Spanish economy. The form the recovery takes will depend on how the business landscape has changed. If we can avoid a situation where many companies go under as we journey through this wilderness, I’m sure that when normal life resumes companies will start hiring again and moving in the right direction. This will make it more of a V-shaped recovery than a U-shaped one.  And what about essential industries being paralysed?  That is a political decision. The government thinks that it is accelerating the flattening of the infection curve. I hope it works out. But it has an economic cost.  If you were in government, would you have done the same?  I can’t say. This crisis is unique. I think the guarantees were a good measure to take. We have to try to reduce the costs to firms and ensure that as many of them survive as possible. Because this situation will pass. It’s temporary.  Last question: if you were a minister now, would you be in favour of a total shutdown of the economy for a short period of time?  I can’t answer that, I’m afraid. I’m not a minister now. I was a minister for more than six years, but now I’m at the ECB. What I can tell you is that we at the ECB will do everything possible to keep the euro together and to provide the best funding possible, under the best conditions possible, to the euro area economies, including Spain.   "
2020-03-21,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Bernau and Dennis Kremer","   INTERVIEW 21 March 2020  Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Bernau and Dennis Kremer  Ms Schnabel, never before has the ECB provided so much money for asset purchases in such a short period of time. Is this crisis worse than anything we’ve seen before?   It’s an extraordinary crisis. It’s not just Europe that is affected, it’s the whole world. And in addition to the health problems and the human suffering, we’re also experiencing a severe economic shock that is being compounded by the protective measures taken. Our new asset purchase programme, which has been put in place specifically for this pandemic emergency, aims to address the particular nature of the situation we are facing.  Where do you see the biggest problems?  The crisis is affecting supply and demand at the same time. Initially, the focus was mainly on disrupted supply chains. Now the protective measures taken are also hampering production in many companies. And demand is falling too – if people don’t know what the future will bring, they hold on to their money, especially since many activities have been curtailed. Companies are investing less. And all that means that we are already facing a massive shock; we need to make sure that it doesn’t get even worse.   If the ECB buys sovereign bonds, governments will be able to borrow money more easily and pass it on to firms. Is that still in line with your mandate?  Our actions are always determined by our mandate of price stability. And for this we need a functioning transmission mechanism so that monetary policy is passed on to the real economy. That mechanism had recently become impaired, as manifested by the sudden rise in euro area government bond yields. It was affecting all euro area countries, even Germany. When that happens, monetary policy has to step in.  So it’s not a rescue plan for Italy?  No, of course not. And Italy has not lost its market access. The concern was rather that we could start to see self-reinforcing price spirals…  …meaning that investors start selling, government bonds fall in value, and so even more investors have to sell…  …which can always happen in times of crisis, especially when capital is seeking safe havens. The central bank must act to counter such effects when the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is at risk.  One week ago, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the ECB isn’t responsible for closing risk premia on government bonds. Did that create additional uncertainty?  The markets were questioning whether the ECB continued to stand ready to do everything necessary to stabilise the situation. But that was never in any doubt. And then the situation in the markets deteriorated rapidly, so we had to take further action.   Are there any rules at all now for such asset purchases, or does the ECB just do what it likes?  Our purchase programmes are rules-based. We continue in principle to buy bonds in line with the capital share of each country. But we need more flexibility now, over time as well as across countries and asset classes, in order to tackle the situation appropriately.   Would you have liked to go into this crisis with higher interest rates, so that you could cut rates now?  Interest rates have been set appropriately also in recent years. Higher interest rates were not an option – otherwise we wouldn’t have been able to fulfil our price stability mandate and we would have damaged the economy. I know very few economists who are of a different view.   Some people are already calling for signals to hike interest rates once the crisis is over.  Your newspaper featured a guest commentary last week on the subject. In view of the current situation, that article seems a little out of place. We are looking at what might well be one of the worst economic crises of all time. It seems inappropriate to be talking about raising interest rates now.  The authors of that piece were talking about the period after the crisis.  We should talk about what happens after the crisis at a later date. For now we need to concentrate on mitigating the effects of this crisis.  Yes, but one does get the impression that every crisis sees the introduction of new measures which then can’t really be unwound afterwards, and then central banks have to come up with something bigger and better in the next crisis. Is that the right way forward?  The new package is proportionate to the situation. It will only run until we have overcome this crisis. Your question also seems to suggest that we need to return to the former style of monetary policy, that is before the ECB began to purchase bonds. But that is not necessarily the case. There are long-term trends that have resulted in very low real interest rates. Among other things, these trends reflect demographic ageing and declining productivity gains. A central bank cannot counter that.   The banks are also a cause for concern. Do they have enough capital to survive this crisis?  It is imperative to prevent the crisis from spreading to the banking sector. That’s why measures targeting liquidity bottlenecks in firms are especially effective; they work by warding off high levels of loan defaults at banks. We should be glad that the banks’ capital requirements were significantly increased over the past few years. All in all, the banks are currently much better prepared for a crisis than they were before the financial crisis of 2008.  But is that enough in the face of the current shock?   We are indeed living through a scenario that no one could have imagined. It was therefore never assessed in a stress test – we are unfortunately experiencing it now in real time. If widespread insolvencies occured among borrowers, the banking sector would also be affected. But in many cases, the issue in the first instance is a liquidity bottleneck. That’s something politicians can deal with. The decisive factor is how long the crisis persists.   How long can the economy withstand such a situation?  It depends on how severe the restrictions are and on how well-placed firms are to adjust to them. In some sectors, this is relatively unproblematic; in others, for example catering, it’s hardly feasible. At some point, this situation will presumably become unsustainable, prompting the question as to what role the state intends to play in supporting firms.   Would the ECB then be able to do even more? Or has it completely exhausted its scope for action?   The ECB is in the comfortable position of having a large set of tools, none of which has been used to its full extent. We stand ready to take further measures if needed to fulfil our mandate. This was decided by the ECB’s Governing Council.   So you really want to buy even more bonds? What effects do you envisage?  We have a wide range of instruments: we have the key interest rates, we have instruments for providing liquidity to the banks and we have the asset purchase programmes. All of these instruments can be used to improve financing conditions. That is immensely important during such a crisis. The claim that central banks have run out of tools simply doesn’t match up to the facts.   The German Constitutional Court might put a spanner in the works when it rules on the legality of the bond purchases in May.  Against this backdrop, it’s important that our measures are proportionate. Given the severity of this crisis and the threat of massive economic damage, our monetary policy decisions are in my view appropriate. By the way, the Court’s judgement relates to the existing asset purchase programmes the rules of which we have basically left unchanged.   Would it help if crisis bonds, jointly issued by the euro area countries, were now available?  That could help. The success of our measures hinges on what happens on the fiscal policy side. We can’t resolve the situation by ourselves. Much has already been done at the national level, also in Germany. But it is ultimately a European problem. No country can be indifferent to what is going on in another European country – not only for the sake of solidarity, but also for economic reasons. I hope that this is understood by the politicians.   What should they do?  There are proposals to use the European Stability Mechanism or the European Investment Bank. The issuance of one-off “corona bonds” would also be conceivable. It is up to politicians to decide.   How many people are still working in the ECB tower?   Only a handful of people are still on site. Almost everything is taking place remotely, even the meetings of the ECB’s Executive Board. I’m also hardly in the ECB building now and am working mainly from home.    "
2020-03-20,Luis de Guindos,"Interview with Telediario 2, Televisión Española","Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Carlos Franganillo on 19 March 2020","   INTERVIEW 20 March 2020  Interview with Telediario 2, Televisión Española   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Carlos Franganillo on 19 March 2020  One way or another, this massive asset purchase programme will be of particular help to those countries that have been deeply affected, such as Spain or Italy, to ensure that spreads don’t widen dramatically at this critical time.  It will help all euro area countries. Some were in a weaker position; their public finances were also more vulnerable than others. But what the ECB will not allow is fragmentation of any kind in the sovereign debt markets and a return to the nightmare caused by widened spreads. We are dealing with a huge health crisis, there is a severe economic crisis and we are going to ensure that it does not result in some kind of financial crisis or debt crisis. This is what we are going to avoid because the ECB is at the service of the European people.  The European Central Bank has said that it will do whatever needs to be done to combat this crisis. Does the ECB have more weapons at its disposal for the weeks or months ahead if the situation deteriorates?  We can always do more. As you mentioned earlier in your news item, our commitment knows no limits. We will do whatever is necessary to ensure that this pandemic, which is having a massive economic impact, does not turn into a debt crisis or a crisis of the financial system. We will not allow this to happen. We are dealing with a situation which requires us to act with extreme intensity.  You have said that the measures taken by the Spanish government and other European governments are appropriate. But you have also hinted recently that the European Union has perhaps not responded quite as effectively. Are you afraid that a crisis of this kind could take its toll on the European project?   Let’s hope not. The ECB has already acted. Basically what remains is for Member States also to act and continue to act through their fiscal policies. And we need a pan-European response. We need a coordinated EU fiscal policy response. I am sure that this is what will happen in the end. The ECB cannot be the only policy tool used from an economic standpoint. Monetary policy cannot be the only instrument employed. I am certain that Member States will do something about this and they will adopt a coordinated position in terms of the fiscal policy instruments employed by the EU in response to this huge crisis. The economic impact will be enormous. We just hope that it will be temporary. We have to take all the necessary measures to ensure that our economic fabric is not destroyed, to ensure that businesses that are solvent can survive and that once this urgent health crisis is over, they can return to normal.  You have talked about a temporary crisis, a sort of pause. The Spanish government has talked about the same thing. But do you think this is how things will turn out or do you think the economic consequences for Europe could be more severe for longer?  This will depend on how long the health crisis lasts and, to be honest, I wouldn’t dare to guess how long it might last. What happened in China is a leading indicator. What’s happening to us now happened two months ago in China and now they are starting to get back to normal. Obviously this is something that gives us hope: we can get through this. From an economic perspective, we have to look for instruments to get us through this period at the lowest economic cost and, of course, with no financial cost from a debt market perspective.   "
2020-03-19,Fabio Panetta,Interview with TG1,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gennaro Pellino on 19 March 2020","  Interview with TG1   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Gennaro Pellino on 19 March 2020 19 March 2020  Only a week ago, one sentence suggested we were looking at an abrupt change of direction. What has changed in a week?  I don’t think it’s particularly useful to dwell on one sentence – especially one which President Lagarde herself quickly corrected. I believe that our actions and our policies are clearly demonstrated by our decision yesterday, namely our strong determination to provide support to the Italian and the European economy. We made available €1,100 billion, a vast sum, to support the financial markets. The famous spread has declined significantly today. This measure comes on top of the package we agreed last week, when we made available €3,000 billion to the banks, at very low cost, at very low lending rates, but only on the condition that banks use that funding to finance the real economy, households, firms and government efforts to deal with the public health emergency and support the European and the Italian economy.   What does the ECB want to achieve now with this new liquidity issuance?  The coronavirus pandemic will reduce economic growth in Italy and Europe by some percentage points. Our actions aim to prevent the hardships and struggles that European citizens and households are currently enduring from being compounded by the economic difficulty that could result from a recession. We have taken decisive action to prevent such developments and President Lagarde has stated that there are no limits to the action we will take to ensure that the European economy is able to continue on a path of growth.  What can European citizens expect now from Europe and the European Union?  Italian and European citizens can expect what they are entitled to, namely strong, decisive, unified and coordinated action by national governments and European institutions, including the European Central Bank, to alleviate the hardships and economic difficulties that they will inevitably face as a result of the pandemic. We will be in the front line of this action. President Lagarde has stated that the European Central Bank will continue to act decisively until the emergency related to the coronavirus has been overcome.   "
2020-03-18,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Radio Nacional,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Iñigo Alfonso on 18 March 2020","  Interview with Radio Nacional   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Iñigo Alfonso on 18 March 2020 18 March 2020  Mr de Guindos, how are you? Good morning.  Good morning.  Thank you very much for being with us during these very challenging times for our country, and for Europe in general. You were one of the government ministers who had to deal with the long economic crisis that began in 2008. Are there any parallels with this crisis? Is there a risk that it could be as damaging as the Great Recession? Are you concerned that it will be?  No, I think the current situation is different. We are experiencing a health crisis, a pandemic, which will obviously have a significant impact on economic activity. There will be sectors whose turnover will essentially be reduced to zero. But the key difference is that we expect this to be temporary. The word “temporary” is very important here. The 2008 crisis lasted until 2013 in Spain. We’re talking about the current situation lasting for weeks or months, not longer.  Christine Lagarde, the ECB President, is calling on governments to take action to avoid this apocalyptic scenario. Are they taking action? Do you think they took note of what she said?  Yes, I think they have begun to take action. In terms of fiscal policy, we have seen that the Spanish government, the French government, the German government… All of them are taking fiscal policy measures, essentially to create a sort of “bridge” for this temporary period in which we are dealing with the health crisis and this infection. So yes, I think that measures have been taken at the national level. At the European level, that’s a different question.  Why do you mention “European”? Because you think that the response of governments has been found wanting so far?  I think having a joint, pan-European response would be very important. For example, I think having a single fiscal instrument for the euro area would have been crucial. But we aren’t going to look backwards. There are still possibilities. On Monday, for example, the Eurogroup considered the possibility of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) acting jointly for all European countries. And then there is the ECB, of course.  This European Stability Mechanism is a governance tool that came out of the previous crisis. Do you think this rescue fund should take action? Could it still help to make this situation just a little more bearable for millions of Europeans?  Yes, it could take action because it has a capacity of €410 billion. The circumstances are totally different to those of the debt crisis, but clearly an instrument with a capacity of €410 billion is of interest to us.  Do you think the Spanish government’s plan is well targeted? Do you think it will be helpful?  I think so. The €100 billion of guarantees are very significant. The ECB has given banks all the liquidity in the world, one could say. But if the banks are not able to pass this liquidity on to their customers because they have doubts about their customers’ creditworthiness, then it’s all for nothing. I think the plan for €100 billion of guarantees is key here, because it’s a guarantee for everyone that the ECB’s liquidity will actually get to where it needs to go. So yes, this is very well thought out. Another important issue is the measures to ensure that the situation regarding workers is flexible during this period. We are going to have a situation where many firms that were perfectly solvent are now struggling. So everything that helps workers, such as the temporary layoffs (in Spanish: expedientes de regulación temporal, or ERTEs) or reduced [social security] contributions, is a step in the right direction. Overall, I think the government’s plan is the right one, it’s going in the right direction and I hope everyone supports it.  Thanks to its deficit, its indebtedness, Spain has limited room to activate fiscal measures. Given that this is an extraordinary situation, do you think that the EU should set aside the financial orthodoxy of recent years and move towards being more flexible?  It’s already set it aside, hasn’t it? The EU has said that it is not going to apply the Stability and Growth Pact, that there is an escape clause, so governments will be able to spend more. There will be a natural deterioration of public finances. But I say again, this is not like 2008, when there was a severe, long-lasting deterioration. Now it’s about tackling an emergency, a health emergency, and acting as coherently as possible.  The latest measures taken by the European Central Bank – you mentioned earlier the role your institution has to play during this crisis – have failed to calm the markets. Does the ECB have an ace up its sleeve, if I can use that expression? Or will it provide a reminder of President Draghi’s words, “whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.”?  I think that the ECB President Christine Lagarde has made it clear that we will do what needs to be done. There is no doubt about that. This crisis is different. It is not financial in nature. It could become financial if we did nothing, but it’s not a financial crisis. It’s a health crisis that will have a huge economic impact. What we can do is relieve any financial pressures that may arise. But the main action will come from governments, through fiscal policy.  The ECB has announced that it will buy more debt, that it will inject liquidity.  That is correct, we have announced that we will buy €120 billion more than we were buying before. The previous figure was €240 billion, and we can be flexible in our approach. We will also ensure that the markets continue to function properly, that fragmentation does not occur, particularly with the spreads, since this would affect the transmission of our monetary policy impulses. That’s why we are taking decisive action.  Are you in favour of adjusting interest rates like the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England?  Our interest rates were already much lower. First of all, I feel that the most important step to take was to introduce liquidity measures. European banks have all the liquidity they need at their disposal, under very favourable conditions. The second step comes through bond purchases. These two measures will have a much greater effect than adjusting interest rates, which in Europe were already -0.50%.   The volatility that the markets are experiencing, the instability: is it temporary? Do you think that investors will somehow calm down once they see all of the measures that have been taken starting to take effect?   As you mentioned earlier, I think that all of the central banks, all of the governments, we are going to do everything we possibly can. But calm will return once we actually start to see that the epidemic is under control. That is the key issue. Take China for example. China is a leading indicator of what might happen. After experiencing a drastic fall in economic activity for two months, things have started to recover there and we can see how the economic situation is gradually getting back to normal. This is the most important thing we must take into account and which will undoubtedly help calm investors and the economy.  Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, thank you very much for speaking to us. I think that you have also been in confinement lately, is that correct?  Yes, that’s correct. We have been teleworking for more or less ten days now.  And how do you organise your work? Do you maintain contact with colleagues in Frankfurt, Madrid, etc?   We hold teleconferences all the time, and there is of course a small team of people who are working on site at the ECB premises. Everything else is handled via teleconference.  From now on, ECB decisions taken at meetings called by the President and the Governing Council, can they be taken as normal via videoconference? Can you take effective measures from there?  Yes, of course. The Executive Board is now always held by teleconferences, for example. We speak every day. We hold team meetings. We continue to operate because teleworking is possible. It’s not ideal, but clearly in these circumstances it’s the only option available and it works relatively well.  Well, that is a good sign, isn’t it? That everything hasn’t ground to a halt.  Yes, of course it hasn’t.  Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, thank you very much for speaking with us.   Thank you.   "
2020-03-18,Isabel Schnabel,Interview with Die Zeit,"Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Lisa Nienhaus on 16 March 2020 and published on 18 March 2020","   INTERVIEW 18 March 2020  Interview with Die Zeit   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Lisa Nienhaus on 16 March 2020 and published on 18 March 2020  Ms Schnabel, where are you speaking from at the moment: your home office?  No, I’m in the main building of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. As the board member responsible for market operations, I need to be on site. But many of us, including other members of the ECB’s Executive Board, are indeed working from home. And I am also keeping at a safe distance from colleagues.   Indeed, it would not be good if you were absent from the ECB. Market prices are collapsing, loans are defaulting, firms are threatened by bankruptcy if they don’t get help. Is the virus crisis now turning into a financial crisis?  We are living through turbulent times: stock markets are showing extreme volatility, equity prices have fallen dramatically. And the events are gradually being reflected in the data that we receive from the real economy. We know that production in China collapsed in January and February. All that will also have an impact on the banking system, but there is no acute banking crisis at present. We are, however, carefully monitoring the current situation so that we are able to respond swiftly to new developments should that become necessary.   Which indicators are you looking at?   We monitor all financial market data: equity prices, interest rates, capital flows. Corporate and sovereign debt markets are also important.   What is going on there?   We have seen a sharp increase in the risk premia that firms have to pay when raising debt on the markets. For high-risk firms in particular, these risk premia have shot up.  Yields for countries such as Italy have also increased significantly.  We see a broad increase in risk premia. Another question that arises is whether the markets are still functioning. Is supply still matching demand? The central bank should intervene if liquidity dries up, that is if the markets suddenly seize up because of a lack of available liquid funds, or if the transmission of monetary policy is endangered, that is if our measures are not reaching the real economy. And that is exactly what we have been doing in greater measure since last Thursday. Our bond purchases have a stabilising effect on the market.   US Treasuries have seen some severe temporary disruptions.  There was a series of short intervals in which the trade in US Treasuries was disrupted. That’s a sign of considerable nervousness in the markets. Besides the markets, we are closely monitoring the situation of banks in Europe. We have taken measures to prevent banks from having to overly restrict their lending during the crisis. But the pressure on banks will intensify if economic conditions deteriorate. We are also closely watching investment funds.   What is happening there?   Up to now we have only seen isolated capital outflows but we need to keep an eye on that. In the event of large outflows from investment funds, the main concern would be to prevent an excessive fall in prices caused by fire sales - that is, distressed sales of assets at large price discounts.  On Sunday, the world’s central banks decided on extensive coordinated measures. The ECB announced a first major package on Thursday. What is the point of all that if the financial crisis has not yet set in?  The situation in financial markets is already very tense. Last Thursday, we decided to provide abundant and very cheap liquidity to the banking system. That is the primary task of central banks at present. On Sunday, in a coordinated effort with other major international central banks, we took measures to provide banks with cheap US dollar liquidity. We did so because banks in some countries, especially Japan, had been finding it harder to access US dollars.   The US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates. The ECB stepped up its asset purchases. But none of this seems to have had the desired effect. Equity prices continued to fall. What is going wrong?   The ECB’s package was very comprehensive. But market volatility is partly masking the effects. Moreover, not all market participants seem to have immediately understood all of the components of the programme. The additional net asset purchases in particular will help to counter the self-reinforcing dynamics on the bond markets. We are helped by the operational flexibility of the asset purchase programme, which we are already using to its full extent.   So did the ECB communicate poorly?   The key message of the programme should be clear. The ECB stands ready to do everything within its mandate to counter market disruptions that impair the transmission of its monetary policy, because monetary policy cannot otherwise be effective. This is the unanimous decision of the Governing Council.  Is it perhaps the case that central banks are simply powerless in this crisis?  No, but monetary policy cannot resolve this crisis on its own. We also need a strong fiscal response, ideally at European level. Most economists agree that fiscal policy is currently the most important instrument with which to counter the crisis.  Why?  The ECB can provide banks with liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the banks will actually lend to companies that are struggling because of the virus. That’s where the government comes in. It can support the economy by issuing credit guarantees, for example. The package of measures adopted by the German government on Friday contained guarantees of that kind. Other Member States have agreed on similar measures.  The fiscal response at the international level hardly looks coordinated. Is that a problem?  Absolutely. We need a strong, joint fiscal policy response in Europe. This crisis is not limited to individual Member States. Everyone is affected, and events in one country affect all other countries too. I hope that this is clear to the decision-makers. In terms of monetary policy, we will do our part to prevent fragmentation in the euro area.  The border closures and all the different national arrangements we’ve seen suggest that it is more like “everyone for himself” at the moment.  The primary goal has to be to contain the spread of the virus. It may be that closing borders is an appropriate step from that point of view. That’s something that virologists are best placed to judge. But it’s clear that all protective measures come at an economic cost. And that is precisely why we need coordinated action, so that we can avoid deepening the crisis.   But not every country can afford that.  That’s true, and that’s precisely why we need European cooperation. What we need now is European solidarity, also in financial terms. That is in the interest of all European countries.  Is it even possible now to prevent a recession as a result of the virus crisis?  We are experiencing a very severe economic shock. Supply chains are being disrupted and, at the same time, demand is contracting as governments introduce protective measures: people are travelling less than before and cannot go out to restaurants and bars. Falling confidence may also dampen consumption and investment. And if people are not able to go to work, that has an impact on production, depending on the sector. So we are seeing many different effects emerge at the same time across the whole world. The likelihood of a recession has thus risen considerably.  What is your expectation for economic growth?  Our latest projections put euro area growth at 0.8% for this year. But that is now out of date. We will certainly have to adjust our projection significantly downwards.  Below 0%?  We don’t know yet. The greatest uncertainty is how long the crisis will last. Originally, many economists thought that there would be a short, sharp crisis and that things would subsequently pick up again quickly. It very much depends on how quickly the spread of the virus can be contained, but also on the economic policy reaction.  You have done intensive research on financial crises of the past. Is there any crisis that was similar?  The current situation cannot be compared with the 2008 financial crisis. That crisis originated in the financial system. Today we are looking at a shock to the real economy that is affecting many countries at the same time and for that reason is so devastating for the global economy. If we want to draw a comparison, we should look at other pandemics.  The Spanish flu?  Yes, for example – that pandemic was indeed devastating. The precise figures are not known, but between 20 and 100 million people died back then. Now we are in a much better situation. First, medicine is much more advanced. During the Spanish flu pandemic, many people died from secondary bacterial infections which can now be treated more effectively. And we are economically in a much better position to deal with a shock of this nature.  Why?  The internet puts a whole range of technical options at our disposal that allow us to continue working. Our social security systems are much better. People will only stay at home if they continue to be paid when they get sick. At the same time, there is now more international division of labour than there was back then, so we feel the impact more strongly if supply chains break down.   The economy is estimated to have contracted by 6% at the time of the Spanish flu. Is this virus crisis economically less bad?  No-one can say, but we will play our part in containing the economic consequences of this crisis.    "
2020-03-15,Fabio Panetta,Interview with Corriere della Sera,"Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Daniele Manca on 14 March 2020 and published on 15 March 2020","   INTERVIEW 15 March 2020  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview with Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Daniele Manca on 14 March 2020 and published on 15 March 2020  The question everyone would like to ask of someone following the situation up close, minute by minute, is: are Europe and the euro strong?   I am not in any doubt about the strength of the euro. During the financial crisis, we were able to overcome difficult situations, thanks to the efforts made by the people of Europe. We succeeded by working together and by putting in place policies that were mutually reinforcing. It’s important that, at such a difficult time, national governments and European institutions implement common policies in a timely fashion. Right now we’re working towards tomorrow’s Eurogroup meeting – there needs to be a joint response to this crisis which, let’s not forget, is affecting every country in Europe. And the ECB is working with Europe to strengthen that response.  The stock market fell sharply after the ECB President’s press conference on Thursday. Influential voices joined in with the criticism that followed, and even the Italian President got involved. But is the ECB ready to help Italy?   The decisions we took this week demonstrated that we are ready and able to play our part. Regardless of any isolated events that may occur in the heat of the moment, at a time of immense pressure and hard work, the ECB and the national central banks have decided to take strong action and apply all the flexibility needed at present, and we have resolved to adopt further measures if necessary. Facts are what count right now, and we will do everything we have to, within our mandate.   What concrete action can the ECB take to help Italian firms and households?  First of all, let me say that the economic consequences of the pandemic will need to be addressed first and foremost by governments. They are the ones that are able to implement swift and decisive measures to support healthcare systems, employment and household income. They are the ones who can take targeted action to help firms, providing public guarantees in order to channel credit and liquidity to companies affected by the crisis. So it’s a positive step that European governments are following the example of the Italian government and are taking action.   And what about the ECB?   These actions will reinforce the effects of the measures put in place by the ECB. Monetary policy is supporting firms and households by keeping interest rates exceptionally low, even negative, and ensuring that banks are able to continue lending to the economy. The measures we have just taken seek to ensure that lending to the real economy does not contract, and, if possible, increases. Banks can now obtain €3,000 billion of funding from the ECB at the most favourable conditions there have ever been. We expect these measures to help those sectors worst affected by the crisis, in particular the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that play such a key role in the Italian economy. Finally, we shouldn’t forget that the ECB’s banking supervision arm, which also involves the national authorities, has taken action in recent days to ensure that the crisis does not prevent banks from supporting the economy. Banks will now make use of the scope this gives them to support firms and households, not to increase salaries or dividends.  Can you explain what you decided last Thursday, because the markets didn’t really understand it at first. The Italian stock market fell by 17% …   Last Thursday we reduced the cost of funding for banks, provided that they, in turn, pass on that funding to firms and households – effectively, we further reduced the cost of lending to the economy. We took measures aimed at easing the eligibility criteria for the assets used by banks as collateral in our refinancing operations. We have not, so far, reduced the interest rate on the deposit facility (the rate which is currently relevant for monetary policy, and which is below zero); however, further cuts would be possible if warranted by the economic outlook.  And on government bonds?   We increased our asset purchase programme by €120 billion, which will allow us to address tensions in the government bond markets. In the course of this year, we will make net purchases totalling €360 billion. If necessary, this programme could be expanded again. The turbulence seen in the Italian government bond market in recent days is undesirable and needs to be allayed. Large, unwarranted increases in spreads, caused by the grave health crisis – which risk fragmenting the euro area government bond market and undermining the transmission of monetary policy – will be addressed decisively. The package of measures that we adopted this week allows us to act flexibly in terms of both the pace and the composition of our asset purchases, meaning that we have the possibility to focus our efforts on asset classes and countries that come under pressure.  At a time of heightened market sensitivity, seeing the possibility of purchasing corporate bonds open up has created the impression that the ECB is less focused on purchasing sovereign bonds.  This is a misperception. The asset purchase programme was relaunched by the Governing Council in September, when Mario Draghi was President, and has been expanded in recent days under the presidency of Christine Lagarde. It is a necessary tool to bolster the effectiveness of monetary policy when there is less room to use the traditional interest rate tool. The purchases involve both public and private sector bonds, with the aim of facilitating the achievement of the price stability objective. But, in fact, the operations primarily involve public sector bonds, which represent over 80% of purchases carried out thus far.  There is a lack of liquidity in the economy and this problem will become increasingly acute. These sales on the financial markets are aimed at selling bonds to obtain liquidity.  I am obliged to be boring: we have all the necessary tools, we are using them decisively and are able to do even more. At present our monetary policy operations ensure unlimited liquidity for the banks. Liquidity stress could emerge among non-bank intermediaries. If necessary for the conduct of monetary policy or to safeguard the stability of the financial system, the Governing Council could consider whether and how to expand the list of intermediaries that can be supplied with liquidity and the rules for participating in our refinancing operations.  Christine Lagarde told European leaders that if no action is taken we run the risk of a shock like the one seen in 2008. Is that the case?  The global shock we face could be even worse than the one in 2008 if it is not managed with the necessary care. In the two weeks preceding the meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council, the markets fell faster than they did when Lehman Brothers collapsed. Today the shock is more complex and potentially wider reaching. The risk of the rapid spread of the virus is causing us to make much greater changes to our daily lives than was the case ten years ago. Just look around at the closed businesses and schools.  We will have to revise our growth estimates. Should we prepare for a recession?  The effect of the crisis will depend on the policies we implement and could reduce growth by a few percentage points, for Italy and other European countries. It is therefore good that policy responses are being activated. The sooner a plan to kick start the economy is ready, the better it will be. I also hope that the geopolitical tensions of recent months will weaken, so as to strengthen confidence. We cannot allow other shocks to occur, such as trade or currency wars.  The other central banks have also taken action, but it has not sufficed to reassure the markets – a sign that monetary policy has become less effective or confirmation that central banks can do a great deal but they cannot do everything?  Some may hold the view that central banks are practically omnipotent. This is a false impression that could distort public debate, by attributing to central banks responsibilities and tasks that are beyond their remit. Central bankers should be well-versed in their tools, but should also know their limits. Monetary policy is a very powerful tool for influencing the financial markets, the process of creating credit to the economy, consumption and investment decisions, job creation and inflation. But it cannot influence the healthcare system, it cannot make people start going to restaurants and theatres again.  There are a great many reasons for pessimism. Can you give any reasons for Italians to be optimistic?  I can give them many reasons. In economic terms, we have a strong private sector with low household indebtedness, an internationally competitive manufacturing sector, a positive balance of payments and a balanced international investment position. We must not let the crisis weaken us. We have improved the situation of the banks, albeit not without effort. But the main reason for pride and optimism is the great unity and determination in response to the emergency of the virus shown by our country in a very difficult situation. I am thinking of the people working in the hospitals and institutions, but above all the Italian citizens, who are calmly enduring severe hardships for the sake of safeguarding the public good.   "
2020-03-03,Luis de Guindos,Capital markets union: the role of equity markets and sustainable finance,"Contribution by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, on the occasion of the publication of the ECB report on “Financial integration and structure in the euro area”, Frankfurt","   INTERVIEW 3 March 2020  Capital markets union: the role of equity markets and sustainable finance   Contribution by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, on the occasion of the publication of the ECB report on “Financial integration and structure in the euro area”, Frankfurt The release of the ECB report on “Financial integration and structure in the euro area” is an excellent opportunity to share some thoughts on the European capital markets union, or CMU project.  Well-functioning and innovative capital markets are essential in enabling firms, households and governments to access stable funding and saving opportunities that are vital for consumption, investment and, ultimately, economic growth and employment.[1] One could even argue that the CMU is a common denominator across many – if not all – EU strategies and a pillar for strengthening the EU’s autonomy on the global stage. Without progress towards a fully-fledged CMU, we will face significant difficulties in effectively addressing the global challenges facing the EU. Further developing and integrating EU capital markets takes on even more urgency in light of the challenges posed by the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. Last, but certainly not least, there are strong synergies between the completion of the CMU and the finalisation of banking union. Though the world of finance may sometimes seem distant or arcane, it is more important to people’s everyday lives than many might think. For one, badly functioning financial systems have the potential to harm all of us – as the experiences of 2008 and beyond have shown. I will start with a short update on the progress achieved so far, and then turn to the way forward, focusing on two key dimensions in developing deeper capital markets: risk capital markets and sustainable finance. Significant advances were made in the first phase of the CMU, but more can be achieved Following its launch in 2015, the CMU agenda led to some important accomplishments. Thanks to the efforts of the European Commission together with the Council and Parliament, 11 out of 13 proposals from the original action plan were successfully adopted across a number of important areas, including insolvency frameworks, covered bonds, securitisation markets and the development of a pan-European pension product. These policies are expected to have very positive effects on the development and integration of EU capital markets, even though initial ambitions had to be scaled back in some cases in order to reach agreement among the co-legislators.  While it will take time for the full impact of these measures to unfold, we need to go further to unlock the potential of the Single Market – important building blocks are still missing. [2]  Relaunching CMU should be a priority for the years ahead  Recent developments have increased the urgency of bringing the CMU to the next level. First, the EU needs to address the consequences of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. Given uncertainties regarding regulatory divergence, we should not take it for granted that the EU and UK financial systems will retain their current degree of interconnectedness. As I have said before, a degree of decoupling is inevitable.[3] We therefore need to develop capital markets in areas where the EU financial system is now strongly reliant on the City of London and support the efficient interaction of EU financial hubs, as well as prevent regulatory arbitrage within the EU.  Second, deeper, more efficient and innovative markets can help finance the fight against the climate emergency. Future actions on sustainable finance will be crucial, also in increasing public support in Europe for further policy measures. I will come back to this later.  Third, relaunching the CMU agenda goes hand-in-hand with enhancing the international role of the euro, which has become more important in the present global context. Together with banking union, the CMU encourages the further development, integration and safety of products and markets that are essential for convincing global investors to hold more assets denominated in euro.  Achieving a fully-fledged CMU will require progress across a wide range of issues. I would now like to elaborate on what I see as two key areas for completing the CMU: the dynamism of private equity markets, in particular for the financing of risk capital, and sustainable finance.  CMU and private equity markets in Europe Private equity investment, particularly in risk capital markets, is a pressing area for improvement in the context of the CMU. By risk capital markets I mean private equity and venture capital markets that fund young innovative companies whose projects face higher uncertainty, but also have higher economic value in terms of technological growth. Deep private equity markets are associated with well-documented economic benefits. Similar to, but more forcefully than equity shares traded on stock markets, more private equity investment leads to higher rates of patented innovation.[4] It increases the rate of new business creation,[5] especially in countries that afford greater protection of intellectual property rights and levy lower taxes on capital gains.[6] Moreover, it strongly supports high-tech start-ups on their path to becoming industrial leaders.[7]  In Europe, the development of risk capital markets is being held back by a number of factors and frictions on both the demand and the supply side. For example, cultural barriers to risk taking, such as the stigma of entrepreneurial failure, are rather high; there is a lack of easily available and harmonised information on firms; debt investment enjoys a tax advantage over equity investment; pension products and systems are generally averse to risk capital; and financial literacy[8] – as well as public investment in fundamental science and market-oriented research and development as a share of GDP[9] – is lower than in many peer economies.   What can the CMU do to stimulate the development of risk capital markets in Europe? Reforms to this end include reducing the tax advantage of debt, increasing financial literacy, enhancing pension savings and incentivising adequate equity investment by pension funds, and reorienting EU private investment programmes towards more equity investment in high-tech firms and sectors. Some wider and more long-term public policy choices include significantly stepped up funding for life sciences and technology, as well as introducing product and labour market reforms. By improving the quality of the commercial projects that require funding, such policies will benefit the development of not only private, but also of public equity markets.  The new bi-annual report “Financial integration and structure in the euro area” published today shows that the level of private equity in Europe is not low, unlike that of public equity listed on exchanges. In fact, financing through unlisted equity accounts for a larger share of overall financing in the euro area than in the United States or Japan.[10] However, European private equity markets are comparatively less dynamic in the sense that they fail to provide young and innovative firms with sufficient funding or adequate help in expanding.  CMU and the sustainable finance agenda To most people in Europe, the need for deep and liquid capital markets might not seem the most pressing issue. The latest survey data show that people are more concerned about other topics: climate change and digitalisation.[11] Nonetheless, I am convinced that the CMU has an important role to play here and its advancement should be seen in tandem with the EU’s efforts to support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. The CMU and sustainable finance are two mutually reinforcing initiatives and we could benefit from considerable synergies by making progress on both fronts.  On the one hand, the development of the CMU could support the EU’s drive towards a greener and more sustainable economy. By making it easier for investors to seek out sustainable investment opportunities across Europe, deep and liquid capital markets could help mobilise the funds needed to finance the transition to a low-carbon economy. It is not only the quantity and availability of private capital that matters for this transformation, but also its quality. ECB research shows, for instance, that equity finance seems to be more effective than debt finance in reallocating investment towards relatively greener sectors. Equity investors, who tend to have a longer investment horizon and a greater appetite for high-risk high-return projects might be better placed to finance environmentally sustainable innovation than banks.[12] By supporting the development of equity financing, the CMU could facilitate the funding and adoption of carbon-efficient technologies.  But the positive feedback between CMU and sustainable finance works both ways. To the extent that the ongoing EU policy initiatives are successful in removing the current obstacles to the development of a cross-border market for sustainable financial products, these actions could also be instrumental in advancing growth in this segment of the capital markets. This, in turn, could support financial integration in the EU and strengthen Europe’s role as a global hub for sustainable finance.[13]  Conclusion Developing private equity markets and supporting efforts towards a greener economy are very much on the minds of decision-makers, and we welcome the work of the various groups and forums that contribute to these debates. In particular, we look forward to the recommendations of the High Level Forum on CMU set up by the Commission. We trust these will play an important role in shaping the Commission’s new set of CMU measures for the benefit of the European citizens.

2020-02-14,Philip R. Lane,Interview with RTÉ (Ireland’s National Television and Radio Broadcaster),"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Robert Shortt on 13 February 2020 and broadcast (in part) on 13 February 2020","   INTERVIEW 14 February 2020  Interview with RTÉ (Ireland’s National Television and Radio Broadcaster)   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Robert Shortt on 13 February 2020 and broadcast (in part) on 13 February 2020  There has been some criticism of ECB policy when it comes to quantitative easing and negative interest rates. Some people have described it as an experiment in monetary policy. There’s been this assertion that interest rates are no longer an effective tool for stimulating economic activity. People have painted the scenario of the Japanification of the eurozone economy. What’s your response to all of that?  We don’t agree with that analysis. If you go back to 2014, which is when this policy started, since then ECB monetary policy has been very effective. We have seen very low interest rates for firms and households. We have seen a big increase in employment in the euro area economy. And we do see inflation moving upwards. Without these policies these disinflationary pressures would be more severe. We would not only have lower inflation: we could even have the risk of deflation. And without these policies the recovery in Europe we have seen in the last five or six years would not be so far advanced. So we think ECB policy is still effective. Going back to your question about Japan, all of this is very much with the intent of avoiding the situation of deflation that Japan had from the mid-1990s to about 2013. That was a very costly episode to have and we are intent on making sure inflation goes back to target in order to avoid that situation.  What would you say to the criticism – and it’s been quite loud in some eurozone countries – that the ECB has been deaf to some of the side effects of its policies, say, in particular towards savers and pensioners?  At any time when the interest rate goes down, it clearly has a different effect on those who have a mortgage and those who have a lot of debt -- governments and corporates -- than it does on those households that are maybe saving for retirement, those who are accumulating funds and pension funds. That has always been true. Monetary policy has different effects on savers and debtors. What is true at the moment is that this episode has been going on for years now. We have had very low interest rates for a long time and that does have implications for the financial system and for these groups. Going back to the previous question, if we did not pursue these policies then the medium-term scenario would be worse. If inflation gets worse, if it gets lower, if it gets locked in at a low rate, then the prospects for interest rates recovering in the future would be less.  A temporary phase, which we are in, of low interest rates makes it more likely that we will return to a situation where savers get a better deal. It is a temporary phase, but there is no doubt that there are consequences for those looking to earn income. This is not a situation that is ideal. But we are still in the legacy of the crisis and I think this policy path is correct. We also always say that, in terms of the speed of the recovery, European fiscal policymakers can do more. Those countries which have fiscal space can do more to accelerate the recovery.  Some have said that the continued low interest rates and quantitative easing have had benefits for large investment funds, and for the area of property investments in particular these benefits come at the expense of individual prospective house buyers, or indeed people who end up renting. It’s become an issue here as it has in other parts of Europe. How would you respond to that?  The low interest rate environment has many benefits. It helps to create jobs. For those with a mortgage, it reduces the cost of maintaining that mortgage. For highly indebted governments there is a saving in terms of debt service payments. But there is no doubt about it: it does mean that it raises the purchase price of homes. It raises the purchase price of commercial property, so those, as you say, with a lot of financial firepower, global institutional investors and so on, will find it easier to deal with that. And as you say, there are knock-on effects in the rental market, absolutely. We have a strategy review this year, where I think we have always been alive to these concerns. Revisiting how we think about housing in how we do monetary policy is part of that review. For monetary policy, if it has these consequences, we need what we call macroprudential policy to go hand-in-hand.  So here in Ireland, as you know, the Central Bank of Ireland has mortgage rules, and it is a very difficult situation. If someone says that in order to allow the individual to compete with the global investors, maybe they should be able to borrow more money: I don’t really think that’s part of the answer. We tried that before here, and we need to keep a limit on the amount of debt that households take on. Because the cost of excessive debt is so high, as we know in this country. Going back, how we deal with improving affordable housing, all of these are frontline political issues, that is true across Europe in different ways. For a fast-growing economy like Ireland, where the workforce is growing, where there is so much pressure on housing, it’s obviously quite intense. But we don’t think tighter monetary policy from us is part of the answer.  Some would say that part of the answer would be to cap particularly retail interest rates charged by banks. Do you see that as part of the answer?  This is a long-running debate here. Even though the ECB rate is quite low, when you look across Europe, the mortgage lending rates in Ireland are higher. The ECB has provided a legal opinion on the draft law, and it highlights, in line with the Central Bank of Ireland analysis, that a policy that caps the interest rate runs the risk of having an unintended effect, which is that it will deter entry. The Irish banking system is quite concentrated. Many people would like to see more banks enter to compete and, through competition, lower the rates. If you have a legal approach, where there is a legal regulation capping the interest rate, then the incentive for foreign lenders to come in is less. We have this long-running debate about the contribution of the quite high default risk in Ireland being built into those higher rates. I understand the intent: trying to make housing more affordable is a big issue. But personally, and in terms of the official advice of the ECB, we think capping interest rates is not the advisable way to go.  You don’t even see a role for it, say, if you were to consider the housing situation to be an emergency scenario; that it would be a temporary measure given to the central bank?  Well, again let me come back to the basics here. So much of the funding now in the Irish property market is not coming from mortgages. You give the example of global institutional investors. What is driving the overall pricing of housing, also rental accommodation and so on, is not the mortgage situation in Ireland. Those global factors will be there no matter what happens to these mortgage rates in Ireland. It’s a very important issue for the individual in terms of coping with the mortgage they face. But in terms of saying this will somehow contribute to a repricing of the value of property, I don’t think that’s how it will work.  We’ve just had an election. We probably won’t have a government for some time. What economic advice would you give to any incoming government?  Every six weeks when we make our monetary policy statement, the last part of our statement essentially gives the list of our advice. One thing is that we do think the European economy will be better off the more governments do to improve the functioning of the economy. There is a long list of recommendations, called the country-specific recommendations that the European Commission offers to the member countries. Ireland has a long list in terms of improving infrastructure, productivity, etc. There are many dimensions to it, but I think everyone can identify the same list. We also say that those countries with a strong enough fiscal position can do more to raise the level of economic activity in the euro area. But we also say that those countries with high levels of public debt, and less robust public finances, need to make sure their fiscal position is prudent.  What I have just said there doesn’t boil down to any fixed set of demands. In the end, the decisions of government are correctly left with the political system. But in terms of some core principles, it’s to balance prudence in managing the public finances and to make sure that the government policies are promoting sustainable growth: sustainable, long-term, climate-conscious, consistent with the carbon transition, consistent with raising productivity. If you read the manifestos of all the parties, they all have different ideas, but I think all share the same principle, which is: the more we can have a sustainable economy that is delivering employment and so on, the better for the future of the Irish economy.  Is the Irish economy one of those countries that has more room to stimulate economic activity?  Well, as you know, this is a long-running debate. At one level, there has been a lot of progress. All of these difficult years of austerity have led to a big improvement in public finances and the number one uncertainty is about the future of corporation tax revenue, which has been unexpectedly high. When I was at the Central Bank of Ireland, and where I am now, we would still have the same concern, which is: where do you strike a balance between recognising that this is an important source of revenue versus whether it is guaranteed to be here into the future. For any incoming government, having a prudent approach to managing that would be important.  You’re nine months into the job: what do you think the advantages are for Ireland of having the former Governor of the central bank here in such a key role at the ECB?  What’s very interesting about the ECB is that our only focus is on the overall performance of the euro area. The euro area is a very important trade partner for Ireland. What is good for the wider euro area would typically be good for Ireland. What I can say more generally is that the ECB has staff from everywhere in the EU. It’s very interesting to have that diversity. We talked earlier on about savers versus debtors. That’s important because that differs across the euro area. Some countries have big manufacturing sectors. Other countries are more focused on tourism or technology. It differs so much that having staff -- and, if you like, the Executive Board membership -- that reflects the diversity of the euro area makes for a very interesting workplace and I think makes for better-quality policymaking.  One of the things we’ve been very worried about here for quite some time is Brexit. What concerns would you have? What concerns at a European level, at the ECB level, are there about Brexit?  Let me make three points on this. One is, as I think it’s well understood here: we’re in a pause. Brexit has happened, but until we know what the new trade deal is going to be, the uncertainty remains. The more quickly a trade deal is concluded the better, because we do think uncertainty in general is holding back the European economy.  A second point to make is trade frictions: the more severe the trade frictions, the worse we think the medium-term performance of the UK and European economies will be. But taking the overall European view: the United Kingdom is not big enough. It’s a big country, but compared with the EU27 it is not big enough to be the driving force for the future of the euro area. Of course, it’s more important for us (in Ireland), as it’s the closest neighbour. But for the euro area, while it’s an important concern, compared with global trade and the future of, say, China and the emerging economies, this is a medium-priority topic.  The last point is that, in terms of the financial system, it’s very important that we have good supervisory relationships with the Bank of England and the other supervisors in the United Kingdom. So even though the trade deal focuses on trading goods and services, we also have an agenda to make sure we can work together post-Brexit in terms of supervising the euro area financial system and the UK financial system.  Final question, just on a personal level: how are you finding the new job? Are you enjoying it? Is it everything you thought it would be? What’s Frankfurt like?  Let me say two things. One is that of course I very much miss working at the Central Bank of Ireland, which is a great institution. But as an economist, leading the economics work of the ECB is a tremendous personal challenge and tremendously fulfilling. I can tell you that residentially, Frankfurt as a city is fantastic to spend time in. They may have historically a reputation of being a bit quiet, but I think anyone who spends time there is pleased with it. It is a really nice city to visit.   "

Would you say that you are now on a type of peacekeeping mission to mediate between the central bank and the German public?   No, that is not what this is about. I am not a mediator between two parties; I am now a member of the ECB’s Executive Board. But in my new role as a board member I am committed to seeking greater public understanding and clearing up misunderstandings. For people to constantly hear that the ECB’s policy is harmful to them is misleading and it undermines their trust. This worries me.   Which misunderstanding do you wish to clear up specifically?  The expropriation of savers is the main misconception. Even the term itself is legally incorrect. It would imply that the ECB is taking something away from people that rightfully belongs to them. But that is not the case.   But rather?  The real interest rate – that is, the interest rate adjusted for inflation – emerges from the economy’s growth potential in the long run. Sweeping macroeconomic trends – such as demographic ageing and weak productivity growth – have caused a worldwide decline in real interest rates. The ECB cannot change these fundamental developments but can only steer its key interest rates around the trend. If it wishes to fulfil its mandate and stimulate the economy at a time when inflation is too low, it has to lower interest rates even further. If the policy rate then approaches zero, it becomes increasingly difficult to attain its objective with conventional tools. We see this constellation all over the world.   You’re suggesting that the ECB is a victim rather than a perpetrator in respect of negative interest rates. Are there any robust economic studies that back this up?  There are countless studies that estimate the equilibrium interest rate, using various methods and delivering different outcomes. But the trend is clear, it is pointing downward. I understand the frustration about low returns on savings, but that is not the whole picture. Borrowers and property owners have benefited, as have the government and employees. Analyses have been conducted on what would have happened without the ECB’s loose monetary policy. They found that economic growth would have been considerably slower, inflation would have been lower and unemployment higher. The one-sided, negative presentation of the consequences of the ECB’s policies is misleading. All in all, Germany has benefited from the ECB’s monetary policy.   You are saying that savers are not being expropriated at all. But the ECB’s negative interest rate policy effectively means that we can forget about traditional forms of investment such as savings accounts or life insurance policies. At the same time, people are being advised to provide for their retirement. How are they supposed to do that?   If the ECB were to increase interest rates in the current environment, it would be harmful for everyone – not least for savers. I can’t give people any investment tips. But there’s no doubt that, in today’s interest rate environment, it is not especially advisable to put all your funds in savings or time deposit accounts. Politicians also have a duty to inform citizens about the alternatives to interest rate products.   What do you think of German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz’ plans to introduce a tax on share transactions?  This measure is mainly politically motivated. From a economic point of view, I see it rather critically. However, the plan is on such a small scale that it will not really change the financial world.   Another major criticism is that the ECB’s policy has created a situation in which weak firms are being kept alive like zombies thanks to low interest rates. Do you feel that you are unjustly coming under attack on this point too?   The share of unprofitable firms has actually declined over the past few years. That runs counter to the theory of “zombification”. All the same, concerns about this issue highlight the need to aspire to sound regulation of the banking sector. Weak banks are more likely to extend loans to weak firms. Thanks to pressure from ECB Banking Supervision, the share of non-performing loans on banks’ balance sheets has fallen sharply. That is an important step in the right direction.   You have spoken in favour of tighter regulations governing sovereign bonds held on banks’ balance sheets. The initiative appears to have foundered on Italy.   The fact that banks hold sovereign bonds is not the problem, it’s rather the concentration of their domestic sovereign bonds. Italian banks primarily hold Italian government bonds, German banks hold German bonds. One lesson from the euro debt crisis was the importance of breaking the link between bank risk and sovereign risk. The topic is extremely senstive politically, but it is pivotal for the stabilty of the euro area. The same goes for the common deposit guarantee scheme. That is why I was delighted about the initiative taken by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who intends to address these topics to deepen the banking union. The political problem has to be resolved by politicians.  But they’re not resolving it, unfortunately.   Many do not seem to be fully aware of the urgency of completing the banking union. The aim must be to design the instruments in such a way that they stabilise the euro area without creating wrong incentives. That is the only way to succeed in completing banking union.   Do you understand this to include the option of allowing individual countries to go bankrupt?  If we take the no bail-out clause in the European treaties seriously, it must be feasible to restructure government debt in an emergency situation. But that should not be to the detriment of the whole financial system. An orderly restructuring can only be a credible measure if it does not endanger the banking system.   Wouldn’t it be much more helpful to the banks for the ECB to finally do away with the penalty interest rates? These are mainly causing trouble for financial institutions.   Banks themselves are primarily responsible for their weak profitability. Many banks were not very cost-efficient even before the financial crisis. They need now to consider what they can do to make themselves more efficient and remain competitive, whether that is through mergers or other means. The recently introduced tiering system, which exempts a significant portion of banks’ deposits from the negative interest rate, is providing considerable relief for banks. And the ECB’s monetary policy has not only had negative consequences for banks’ profits. Positive economic developments mean that there have been fewer credit defaults and lower levels of loan-loss provisions.  Instead of constantly complaining to the ECB about low interest rates, it would be better to ask politicians to implement measures that would push up long-term growth. The ECB is the wrong addressee of such complaints.   But wasn’t it the ECB that, in the early 2000s, kept interest rates too low once before and thus caused an artificial boom followed by a crisis in the southern part of the euro area?  I don’t share that assessment. The causes of the crisis differed greatly from country to country. But there were certainly shortcomings in terms of banking regulation and supervision, which allowed credit to expand massively as equity fell. The ECB can’t be held responsible for that, though – it wasn’t responsible for banking supervision at the time.   A few months ago, a group of renowned former central bankers, including Otmar Issing and Jürgen Stark, published a manifesto in which they were extremely critical of the direction monetary policy has taken. Do you feel that you were treated unfairly there too?   Everyone is free to criticise the ECB, and we also have to take that criticism very seriously. At the time, though, I wasn’t yet at the ECB, so I don’t feel directly targeted. But I thought that the criticism was very one-sided and didn’t pay enough attention to the positive aspects of monetary policy.   It seems that the ECB always tries to refute the arguments made by its critics, but never actually speaks to the critics themselves.  That is a misperception. We regularly invite those who are critical of the ECB to attend our conferences, for example. And we will also make sure that we listen to academics with different viewpoints as part of our strategy review.   If it is indeed the case that the public and the media are unfair in their criticism of the ECB, can you explain why several seasoned German central bankers – including your predecessor – ended up throwing in the towel at the ECB? Did they just misunderstand everything too?   Each of the people involved had very personal reasons for stepping down, and it all happened before I joined the ECB. What I can judge is the current situation, and I find the leadership style of President Christine Lagarde to be very constructive. I don’t have the impression that any particular position in the Governing Council is systematically disadvantaged. There is an open debate.   How do you see the role of the Bundesbank, particularly when it comes to communication between the ECB and the public? Is the Bundesbank partly responsible for the existing alienation?   I’m not so sure about this notion of alienation that the media likes to project. If you look at survey results, the euro is incredibly popular in Germany and has higher approval ratings than elsewhere in the euro area. Interestingly, trust in the ECB as an institution is also above the euro area average in Germany. The Deutsche Bundesbank plays a very important role as an intermediary between the ECB and the German public. Amid all the criticism, there has never been any doubt about its support for the single currency.  So who is responsible for the alienation between Germans and the ECB?  The ECB perhaps didn’t communicate enough with the public in the past. But that’s precisely what we’re trying to change, for example by including civil society in the ECB’s strategy review.  What has been your experience so far of discussions at the ECB – is it more harmonious or more argumentative than the Council of Economic Experts?   (Laughs) I haven’t had much opportunity so far to get into arguments. But I can see that it’s certainly possible to bring dissenting views to the debate and that they will be listened to. That’s very important.  At other central banks, it is usual to hold a vote on interest rate decisions and to publish the result. Should the ECB do the same in future?  That question will also be discussed as part of our monetary policy strategy review. One argument against public votes is that, while national central bank governors are not representatives of their country, they could come under increasing public pressure in the event of such votes. That would run counter to the European idea.  Climate change is another topic to be covered by the ECB’s strategy review. Should the central bank conduct green monetary policy in future?   Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our times. No-one can opt out of that challenge, including the central bank. As long as it doesn’t undermine the ECB’s price stability mandate, the central bank certainly has scope to address it, for example by having a more sustainable approach in its non-monetary policy portfolios.   And do you want to limit your corporate bond purchases to instruments issued by green firms?  That wouldn’t be possible, because the market is much too small. I expect that many more green bonds will come onto the market in future, because there is likely to be strong growth in the sector. And so even if the ECB continues to stick to market neutrality, the proportion of green bonds will increase.   The coronavirus in Wuhan is spreading fear across the world. What risks do you think it poses for the economy, especially here in Europe?  There is huge uncertainty, about both the risk of contagion and the mortality rate associated with the illness. It is often compared with SARS. When that disease broke out 17 years ago, it triggered a sharp slowdown, but the effect passed relatively quickly, because SARS was soon brought under control. No-one can credibly say at the moment whether this time will be worse or not.   The ECB hasn’t changed its forecasts so far, at least.  The next projections will be published in March. We will be monitoring developments very closely until then.    Your personal situation has changed a lot since you joined the ECB. What has been the biggest change in your daily work?   I have to say, it is a very intensive job. I’ve always had a very full calendar, including during my time on the Council of Economic Experts. It was particularly stressful when the Council was preparing its annual report. We referred to that period as the “campaign”. I currently feel as if I’m in a kind of permanent campaign.   "
2020-02-10,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Expansión,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Andrés Stumpf on 6 February 2020 and published on 10 February 2020","   INTERVIEW 10 February 2020  Interview with Expansión   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Andrés Stumpf on 6 February 2020 and published on 10 February 2020  For years the ECB has been asking for help from Member States in the form of expansionary fiscal policy. Do you think it’s possible?  The fiscal framework in Europe right now has its shortcomings. Fiscal policy is decentralised and there is a Stability and Growth Pact that limits the deficit to 3% of GDP and debt levels to 60% of GDP. In my opinion, it isn’t an effective framework for developing a countercyclical fiscal policy in the euro area. The ECB stresses that countries with fiscal space should use it to their advantage and take action. However, it’s often the case that countries with fiscal space don’t have the political will and countries with political will don’t have the fiscal space.   What’s still missing?  I share Mario Draghi’s view that the euro area needs a fiscal instrument that is institutionally independent and has the capacity and size to act countercyclically. Without such an instrument, it will be very difficult for the euro area to have a fiscal policy like that of other countries such as the United States.   And what about Spain? What’s your view on the economic situation?   Generally speaking, the Spanish economy is performing well. It grew by 2% last year, although it’s obviously subject to the global slowdown. Nevertheless, it is performing better than the European average. There are two reasons for this. The first is that the Spanish economy is competitive, and the second is that the financial system is not raising the concerns it did in the past.  Problems in the Spanish economy have typically arisen as a result of excessive credit growth, a real estate bubble or an uncompetitive external sector. None of these are happening at the moment. Spain has had a current account surplus for years. Credit growth is lower than nominal GDP growth and there are no signs of a real estate bubble, although there has been an adjustment and prices have risen again since the crisis. The growth differential of the Spanish economy is sustainable.  Maintaining competitiveness and the clean-up of the financial sector are key. Better than average economic performance is what’s needed during a global slowdown, and that’s what we are seeing. It’s also very important not to make mistakes during an economic slowdown.  Would repealing the labour reform be such a mistake?   As ECB Vice-President it’s not my place to comment on a specific economic policy in an individual country. In general, it’s important to be particularly careful during a downturn in any country. There’s a difference between making an economic policy mistake during a period of strong global economic growth and making the same mistake during a period of uncertainty.  The labour market isn’t uniform. Its foundations are more or less the same, but there are different levels of productivity, capacity, and supply and demand across professions and regions. That’s why measures with pros and cons, such as the minimum wage, can have a positive impact, negative impact or no impact on employment depending on the sector we look at.   Brexit is one of the risks you have warned about the most. How is it being dealt with now?  Brexit isn’t good news. A no-deal Brexit was avoided after the election in the United Kingdom, but the negotiation period is going to be very short. The UK economy remains extremely important for continental Europe because it’s the second largest after Germany. I hope that there will be cooperation and a sense of understanding between the different sides. The first stage will be the trade agreement, which is complicated. I’m confident that, if they reach an agreement in this field, there will also be an agreement on financial regulation and regulatory harmonisation, as that would be the best outcome for everybody.   There are other major sources of global uncertainty, like the trade war, and now the coronavirus...  The stabilisation of the European and global economy is a result of the lower perceived risk of a trade war and the fact that a no-deal Brexit was avoided. With risks like the coronavirus there is always a high level of uncertainty at first, until more details become available and we know how it is transmitted, what the mortality rate is, etc. We will begin to see the real impact once this period of heightened uncertainty is over.   Do you agree with the view that the ECB has created a bubble in the stock market and the bond market?  No, I don't agree. The equity market in Europe is not overvalued. If you look at the risk premium of these assets and compare it with the level of interest rates, you can see that it isn’t overvalued. And in the bond market the natural rate of interest has fallen as a result of technological changes, demographics and low growth. The context of this market has changed. We’re living in a world in which we’re going to have low inflation, low real interest rates, low economic growth and, if the situation isn’t resolved, low productivity. Valuations in the bond market can be understood in this context, not separately. Assumptions that were made in the past are not valid. In fact, including all of these new realities is one of the reasons why the strategy review that the ECB is undertaking is necessary. When the ECB was created at the end of the 1990s and the objective was to keep inflation below 2%, it was because deflation wasn’t a concern. The concern was the opposite, as there were countries with above average price growth. Circumstances have changed significantly during the 20 years of the ECB’s existence.  How do you see the future of Bankia? Does it need to be privatised? Would the ECB accept a publicly owned bank?  My personal opinion is that Bankia should not be a publicly owned bank. But the right time to privatise it needs to be found, in order to maximise income for the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) and the State. It’s not up to me to decide when it will be privatised. In my opinion, however, it’s important that it is done in the end or, at the least, that there is a consistent message that it will be done when the time is right.  The ECB wouldn’t consider a publicly owned bank.  The issue of whether it’s a publicly owned bank or a private bank is a decision for the government. I’m speaking from my own point of view when I say it’s important to stick to a consistent message or approach when it comes to privatising Bankia. This was also part of the approach when the Spanish savings banks were rescued. I fully understand the delay at the moment given the current valuations. This also happened back when I was a minister.   The market has put a lot of pressure on Banco Sabadell, despite it having increased its capital ratio, and there are constantly bets on a merger.  I’m not going to start talking about individual banks. In general, and irrespective of the bank we are talking about, markets don't just look at capital. They also look at its profit outlook, its business model and its sustainability.  Banks are warning about unfair competition from fintechs because they operate outside of the regulatory constraints governing the sector. What progress will there be on this issue?  There is an overarching principle: same risk, same regulation. Fintechs are often start-ups, so I think the main competition comes from bigtech companies. There would be real potential for growth in the retail banking sector if these big players were to take the leap into parts of the financial sector. Digital progress and development are extremely important, but if you take on the same risks then you must be subject to the same regulation. And this isn't only the case for financial matters. It also applies to money laundering and counter-terrorism financing. There must be similar treatment across the board.  All the regulators will have to reach an agreement...  Yes, this is a global problem and it must be handled at a global level. On the regulatory side there is the Financial Stability Board and on the macroeconomic side – which analyses the impact from the point of view of monetary policy – there is the International Monetary Fund, the G7 and the G20. The ECB has a lot to say in Europe, but regulatory decisions are taken by the European Commission and the European Parliament. The approach must be a global one.  It sounds like it will be a very slow process, with so many stakeholders involved.  I disagree. On the issue of stablecoins, for example, I think there was a fairly quick response after the launch of [Facebook’s] Libra.  There’s resistance to an agreement about money laundering.  There is a debate about money laundering, specifically about whether we should move to a single anti-money laundering authority. It would be quite a natural move. Having an independent authority would be a positive step, but cooperation must be strengthened at the European level whatever happens. Money laundering does not just affect the banking sector. Other sectors, such as lawyers and notaries, are also affected. This is why cooperation must go beyond the financial system. The cases we have seen have been very serious and they have had an impact on the reputation of the banking sector. And a bank’s reputation is its main asset.   In the Villarejo-BBVA case, reputation doesn’t appear to have had an impact on business or on the bank’s share price.   At the ECB we don’t comment on individual banks. This case is in the courts and they are responsible for clarifying the facts. As you say, financial stability and business remain unaffected for the time being. Some seem to think that this matter belongs in the past. The ECB’s banking supervision arm has procedures for dealing with potential irregularities related to governance, if necessary.  Is governance in the Spanish banking system adequate?  A bank’s reputation is its main asset, and governance is hugely important in the banking sector. It can and must always be improved. There is room for improvement both in Spain and in the other euro area countries. It’s a matter of priority. Governance must continue to improve, not only because the ECB says so, but also because institutional investors are insisting on it. Good corporate governance is ultimately seen from the point of view of maximising profits for shareholders.  Governance covers topics such as the separation between the Chair of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, in addition to broader issues such as how the board operates and the effective independence of independent directors.  Shadow banking is one of the financial risks that you usually highlight. How can this problem be contained?  The shadow banking sector includes investment funds, pension funds and insurance companies. The latter are closely supervised entities, therefore at the European level it’s the asset management industry that is causing the most concern. The low interest rate environment has led to changes in investment strategies, in favour of assets that are riskier, less liquid and highly leveraged. In Spain this leverage is limited, but it is increasing in Europe and it is quite intense in the United States, particularly in the case of hedge funds. Supervision in this sector is not comparable to banking supervision and there is no lender of last resort. There must therefore be much more transparency, particularly with regard to the leverage of funds. We need macroprudential instruments that can be used to avoid problems. There have been some instances of liquidity problems which didn’t develop into anything more serious because of the more positive, and at the time benign, market conditions. But in different circumstances this could trigger a crisis of confidence.  What will the outcome of the Banco Popular resolution case be? Former shareholders are making claims against the SRB and because of the sale to Banco Santander.  I would prefer not to give an opinion because I have been called as a witness in this case. As a general point, there were two stages during my time as a minister. The first involved injecting €43 billion worth of public money into the banking system and the second involved resolving banks without providing a euro of public money. In terms of acting in the public interest, the second is much better.  Mergers are being suggested as a solution to the lack of profitability. Yet, at the same time, supervisors are acknowledging that mergers between domestic banks offer few synergies. And cross-border operations are full of regulatory obstacles, so what’s the solution?  To the extent that it helps to reduce excess capacity, consolidation is positive from the point of view of cost structure. We also need to maintain a competitive environment. In other words, we need to avoid a situation in which there are very few banks. In this context, fintech and bigtech companies are also potential competition.  Domestic consolidation might be a solution for small and medium-sized banks, but the larger banks could perhaps look to cross-border consolidation. In any case, it’s not the ECB’s place to say which banks should or shouldn’t merge. That’s for the banks themselves and the market to decide. And there isn’t a single solution that works in every case. Consolidation helped improve the cost structure and remove excess capacity in Spain, but there are other factors that must be taken into account depending on each specific case.  Will the regulatory obstacles be removed?   The single supervisor has already said that removing this type of obstacle is important from both a supervisory perspective and a domestic perspective. We mustn’t forget that some of these obstacles come from national law. For instance, the different insolvency rules across countries make cross-border consolidation much more difficult. National authorities still have a certain amount of discretion on specific matters related to banking regulation. It’s important that the European Commission continues to stress the need to harmonise these types of rules.  We’ve already had six years of negative rates and I don’t know whether there’s concern from a financial stability perspective.  Our financial stability publications have warned about this. There are two concerns right now: bank profitability and, more significantly in my view, the non-bank financial sector (previously known as the shadow banking sector). The average profitability of European banks is 6%. This is low, but it has much more to do with structural factors than with monetary policy. Negative rates are having a marginal effect. In fact, they have had positive effects, such as a reduction in provisioning arising from the rebound in economic growth. The cost structure in the euro area is still higher than it is in the United States, and there is still excess capacity and fragmentation. Investors are seeking 10% returns even though European banks are much safer and much more liquid than they were ten years ago. The book value of the European banking sector is at 60%, while in the United States it is over 100%. This is one of the great conundrums we are faced with, and it’s linked to several factors, such as the different economic outlooks in the United States and Europe, and excess capacity. The process of consolidation and cleaning up balance sheets in the United States was more extensive than in Europe.  The ECB has launched the review of its monetary policy strategy. This could mark a turning point in how it carries out its mandate. How have the initial discussions been?   The January meeting focused on the overall approach of the review, which has various parts. The first is the definition of price stability, which has changed over time. This will open up a debate. The second, and in my opinion the most important, is the effectiveness of the different monetary policy instruments. In other words, how effective they are in enabling us to fulfil our mandate and what side effects they can have. The third part includes other objectives, like financial stability, and issues like climate change.  The review will take place over the course of one year and will involve a great deal of listening to all the relevant parties, from academics to institutions and civil society. I’m going into it with an open mind. I want to hear the opinions of my colleagues on the Governing Council and the proposals from the bank’s staff.   Various formulae are being considered in this review of price stability. Do you have an opinion on which is the most accurate?  I have an open mind. I prefer to wait before expressing a preference. Each of the options has its pros and cons. There is also an intense debate about the index that is used to measure price movements, and about whether and how to incorporate housing costs. I think we have to wait until we have all the documents and proposals from the committees. The definition of price stability is very important, but for me the fundamental issue is the effectiveness of the monetary policy tools and their potential side effects.   If the expected rebound in the economy doesn’t eventually happen and the slowdown gets worse, does the ECB have the tools to tackle the situation?   We have the tools and are prepared to use them if necessary. We can lower interest rates further, raise the volume of debt purchases or increase the provision of liquidity, but the side effects are becoming increasingly visible. This is why we keep insisting that now is the time for other players to take the field.   Can rates really fall further?   Yes. Objectively, they can fall further. We haven’t reached the reversal rate – the point at which a rate reduction has a negative impact on lending and growth. I get asked this a lot, but we aren’t there yet.   People are talking about significant side effects.   The side effects appear over time. A monetary policy instrument may have no side effects in the first year, but after two or three years it may start having a slight effect. And the more time that passes, the clearer these effects become. So of course we can do more, but it’s not a straightforward message because we always have to take two factors into account. One is monetary policy, and the other is financial stability. Regarding the latter, it’s essential that we have a macroprudential instrument to give the central bank greater room for manoeuvre.   The latest rounds of liquidity provision have not yielded the expected results. What can be done if the banks do not want money even if they’re being paid to take it?  In the new round of the liquidity provision programme, TLTRO III, the first tender was sluggish and the second was a little better. Let’s see what happens with the third. The ECB sets the funding costs and the availability, but there is another variable – the investment plans for those who this liquidity is targeting – which has more to do with potential growth and structural reforms. For our part, we can reduce funding costs, which we have done, but if afterwards there are no investment plans available for the banks to channel this funding into, that is not the fault of the ECB. We cannot do everything. So the message is that countries have to implement structural reforms and have an appropriate fiscal policy.  Germany has repeatedly spoken out against the stimulus packages. In fact, your colleague on the Executive Board, Isabel Schnabel, has suggested they have created fertile ground for dissatisfaction of the sort we saw with Brexit.  To a very large extent, the euro area’s economic recovery and the 11 million jobs created in recent years are due to the ECB’s monetary policy. And our policy has been very beneficial for Germany as well. The German institutions themselves have given Mario Draghi an award for his work and dedication.  The ECB is assessing what role it should play in the fight against climate change, and there’s even speculation about green criteria for debt purchases. Your thoughts?  Environmental sustainability is an opportunity to channel investment in Europe. Various plans could emerge from this. Europe has a competitive advantage over other regions. Technological change linked to sustainability could be one area in which we could get involved. The ECB’s role, and the potential idea of “green QE”, will form part of the strategy review. I know that there are a range of views on this and we’ll have to see how the debate evolves.  But what’s your personal opinion?  I think that environmental risk is going to become an increasingly relevant part of the analysis of credit ratings. And this will have an impact from the perspective of monetary policy operations, not just for QE, but also for the collateral the ECB accepts in exchange for liquidity. Ideally, the assessment of a company and its rating would take into account not only the current state of its balance sheet and its profit and loss account, but also whether the company might face difficulties in the next five years as a result of the transition to a more sustainable economy. In my opinion, this should be the approach – environmental implications shouldn’t be considered in isolation, they should be incorporated into the overall assessment. In any case, we are already closely monitoring the potential implications of climate change from a financial stability perspective. Work is even being done to develop a methodology that would make it possible to conduct climate risk stress tests.  You’ve already worked with two Presidents. How has the ECB changed from the Draghi era to the Lagarde era?   Obviously, each President is different. Mario Draghi was extremely experienced and his presidency was marked by everything that was done to save the euro. He did an extremely important job. Christine Lagarde has a deep understanding of the euro area economy and is trying to find consensus. I think this is a positive step given the disagreements we have seen within the Governing Council. Everyone has their own style.  In any case, in terms of decision-making, while the President is important, the ECB is itself a machine made up of the staff, the committees, the Executive Board, the Governing Council... Generally, decisions are taken in a collegial way and then the President announces them. That work is very important, but when institutions are sound not everything depends on one person.   "
2020-02-03,Luis de Guindos,Interview with ERT TV (Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation),"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Rallou Alexopoulou on 3 February 2020 and broadcast (in part) on 3 February 2020","   INTERVIEW 3 February 2020  Interview with ERT TV (Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation)   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Rallou Alexopoulou on 3 February 2020 and broadcast (in part) on 3 February 2020  The asset purchase programme (APP) was restarted in November 2019, with no specific expiry date. Greece is currently not eligible to participate in the programme. However, Fitch upgraded Greece’s credit rating to BB on 24 January and the outlook is positive. Do you think Greece could catch up and benefit from the APP if it becomes eligible in the course of this year or the next?   I think the situation is quite clear. The evolution of the Greek economy is positive and I think this is what has been reflected in the upgrades by the rating agencies. So, once Greek bonds reach investment grade, which I hope will be sooner rather than later, they will certainly be part of the APP.  Greece still has the highest level of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the EU. The Greek government has already launched the “Hercules” plan in an effort to reduce the stock of NPLs, and more actions are planned. Taking into account the ongoing normalisation of the Greek financial sector, what are the prospects for the banks to provide the necessary efficient allocation of credit in Greece, with the aim of supporting economic activity and growth?  When you look at the progress of the Greek economy, you realise that it is performing quite well. Greece is outperforming the majority of its peers. I think this is because it has a more competitive economy and its fiscal situation is much better than it was two or three years ago. I think the only problematic aspect of the Greek economy is the NPL ratio, which is very high – as you know it is above 40%. This makes it difficult for banks to provide credit to the economy, to lend to households and non-financial corporations. So, we at the ECB are convinced that it is crucial that Greece further reduces its NPL ratio. And I think that every possible instrument has to be used in order to do that. The Hercules plan is an important instrument. We will do our best to support NPL resolution. There are currently some legal impediments, but it is crucial that these restrictions are taken into consideration and lifted in order to continue reducing the number of NPLs. I hope that Greek banks will find the means and the instruments necessary in order to continue disposing of the NPLs.   From your long experience as Finance Minister of Spain and your participation in the Eurogroup from 2011 to 2018, in a particularly difficult period for Greece, what does the Greek government need to do in order to persuade its European partners to achieve a reduction of the primary surplus targets for 2021-22?  First of all, I don’t want to lecture anybody. Each country is different. I think that the Greek government knows perfectly well what it has to do. But I think there are two recommendations that are valid for every European country. The first is to be competitive, and the Greek economy is now competitive. The second is that it is very important to have a banking industry that works. So it is very important to focus on the situation of the banks. Fiscal policy is beyond the remit of the ECB. However, a general observation is that once you start making your public finances sounder and better, you start reaping the various benefits. I think that this is something which is happening now in Greece. Interest rates have fallen significantly, spreads are narrowing and even rating agencies have started to improve their rating of Greek bonds and their outlook.   Although there appears to be a détente in the US-China trade war, do you think that it still poses a threat to the European economy? What other risks are of concern to the ECB?  The signing of phase 1 of the trade agreement between China and the United States was a positive step and provides some relief from trade policy uncertainty. Markets reacted very positively. We will see what happens next. Regardless of this trade agreement’s various potential implications for Europe, it is very important that we defend our rules-based multilateral trade system. We believe it is the key to creating prosperity and wealth all over the world. It’s the approach that’s supported by the European institutions, and the ECB fully agrees with it.  Is the ECB concerned about the impact of the coronavirus on the European economy?  The outbreak of the coronavirus is an important element that has had a huge impact on equity markets and commodity prices. I think we have to be very prudent. We are in the first stage of this outbreak and know very little about the characteristics of the virus so far. We have quite a lot to learn so it would be a little imprudent for me to speculate on developments. There are many uncertainties, many unknowns. Markets don’t like uncertainties. I have full confidence that the Chinese authorities will be able to address the problem and that the outbreak of the coronavirus will be resolved in a similar way to previous outbreaks.     Are you concerned about the potential negative impact on household savings and income from negative interest rates?   The negative interest rates have been a useful policy so far. They are behind the good performance and recovery of the European economy. But what is quite obvious, and has been acknowledged by the ECB, is that there are also side effects. And these side effects are becoming more visible and more tangible.  Perhaps the message here is that monetary policy cannot be the only instrument in place. Other policies have a very important role to play: structural reforms and fiscal policies. That’s the main recommendation. This is a question of time. In the beginning, for sure, the side effects of negative interest rates were very limited but they are now becoming more visible. Other policies have to be applied and have to be pursued because monetary policy is not almighty.    Are you concerned about bubbles in the European real estate market? If you fear something like this, what kind of interventions would be suitable?   I don’t think there is a pervasive overvaluation of real estate at all. I think we have some pockets of overvaluation, which we can call “bubbles”. The right instrument with which to address this situation is macroprudential policy. That’s the approach. I don’t have full confidence in the policy of leaning against the wind – of using monetary policy to deal with this kind of bubbles. You cannot address, concrete and very specific or particular bubbles with monetary policy. So macroprudential instruments are the correct ones.  How important is the European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) for the completion of the banking union? Is the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures a necessary condition for a fully-fledged EDIS? How could this impact the banks of some countries, including Italy and Greece?  EDIS is key. It is the third pillar of the banking union. Our position is very clear. We have always defended EDIS as a very important instrument in order to complete the banking union. I think that we have to analyse the question of the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures in order to sever the link between the banks and the sovereigns. The finance minister of Germany proposed a sort of “quid pro quo” between EDIS and the sovereign exposure of the banks. These are elements that we have to explore, but the important issue is to take steps in the right direction in order to complete the banking union and to try to bridge the stalemate of sorts that we now have in Europe on how to complete banking union. I would also like to stress the importance of the capital markets union. The capital markets union is going to be key, mainly because of the Brexit disturbance. We need to have much more profound, deeper and more liquid capital markets in Europe.   "
2020-02-02,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 27 January, and published on 2 February 2020","   INTERVIEW 2 February 2020  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 27 January, and published on 2 February 2020  The key motivation for this interview was to look at inflation and monetary policy, and to ask you to try and explain why inflationary pressures seem so low, and why - even though in the past five years the ECB has thrown pretty much the full monetary policy toolkit at trying to raise inflation - it still hasn't hit its target. It’s still struggling to push inflation up. What's driving that? When you listen to economists and you read what people are saying about it, you get multiple explanations. Why do you think that is and what can you do about it?  First and foremost, there has been a big macro shock that has seen the economy operating below potential. In respect to Europe, the lowest end of the crisis was in summer 2012. It has been seven, eight years since then, so those effects have not disappeared. Europe had two crises, one after another. Thinking about the cycle in Europe compared with the United States: that double crisis is relevant for why it's more delayed here. The reason why the answer now is a little different to two years ago is that there is some evidence of a recovery in inflation. Two or three years ago, there was a lot of debate about missing wage inflation. But, after a long period of time, we have had wage inflation now for a couple of years.  But we don't have the transmission into the Phillips Curve.  Much Phillips Curve work basically looks at wages and unemployment. When you look at price inflation, you see a variation. Services inflation is in the high ones now, so it's not the case that services inflation is dead.   By high ones, you mean close to 2%? So in line with your inflation objective?  It’s closer to the objective. The fraction of the price level which is most likely to be influenced by wage pressures is moving closer towards the target. The big gap is in goods inflation. The price level of goods – which is just over half the price index – is still closer to zero than to the target. It is a dichotomy – and this applies globally –between goods prices and services prices.  There's a dichotomy in the real economy as well between manufacturing and services.  Yes, it is an overlay that we have this big manufacturing slowdown at the moment. The difference has been a long-running phenomenon, because the scope of productivity increases is much less in services than in manufacturing. Manufacturing is highly tradeable, whereas services by and large are not. The global influences on inflation that come through commodities and goods prices are much less evident in services. The global question is why inflation in the goods category is so much weaker, while firms in the goods sector are facing more labour cost pressure.  Wages are going up in the goods sector, in manufacturing as well as in services?  Yes, absolutely, even more so. Looking at the markets, many services sectors are made up of smaller firms, which are more competitive. Whereas with many goods markets there is a degree of pricing power. Firms have to look at their market share, for example. So a firm may wish to raise prices, but they feel that the current market conditions are not favourable. This relates to globalisation. Think of sectors like electronics, cars and so on, where there is a fairly small number of global firms.  Yes, but if there's a small number of global firms, they have more pricing power.  They also are elastic: if one firm charges too much, it will lose market share. In the manufacturing sector you have to think about those global forces. To a degree you can segment pricing, you can differentiate pricing strategies across the different continental markets.  Goods are generally more global in terms of competition, whereas services are more domestic and local.  Exactly, yes. It's also the case in terms of scale of global value chains and so on. The cost structures in many goods industries have perhaps become a lot more common because firms are globally sourcing inputs. They might have designers in Europe, IP originators in the United States, and assembling of goods in Asia or central and Eastern Europe. In other words, in addition to the fact that they are competing with each other they might have more similar cost structures, because they are all searching for the optimum way to run a global value chain. That’s why there is more similarity in pricing developments in the goods sector. Now it's suppressing price increases. But that is not necessarily forever. You can also imagine scenarios where if it turns out that the market conditions favour the ability to raise prices that could also happen globally.  Finally, what is unique to the last couple of years is uncertainty. Firms think about whether they really want to risk losing market share by trying to obtain a price increase in a situation where there is a lot of uncertainty. One point is trade tensions, but also the other types of uncertainty: for example in the car industry – with changing consumer preferences – the genuine uncertainty about the future of diesel versus petrol versus electric. In those conditions of uncertainty there may be less appetite than normal for taking risks by raising prices or squeezing demand.  It's not necessarily forever. Do you see signs of it changing at the moment?  Firstly, there cannot be a permanent disconnect between labour costs and prices. The second is cost pressures: upstream, for example, the dynamics of commodity prices, such as energy prices, or other commodities. These have been extremely volatile but if you get an episode where commodity prices have a sustained upward pressure that's going to play an important role in goods prices. Thirdly, we are in a phase of low investment globally. When you have less investment, less capacity: then that downward pressure from excess capacity is less. Some large emerging markets may have rotated from building up more capacity in manufacturing. China is one example. Over time, that may feed into a situation where there is more cost pressure on global manufacturing.  Do you have anything to support this, or are these just theories?  We have regular surveys with euro area corporates which are conducted quite frequently. That’s backed-up by the “Non-financial business sector dialogue”, which is a roundtable with big corporates and the Governing Council.  Going back to modelling, our macro models tend to have mechanical pricing strategies. For example, there might be a kind of constant relation between costs and prices, so these variations in margins should be looked at. But it is still hard to analyse these periods when you have costs going up or prices.  The models are too rigid; they don't allow for this sort of fixing of margins by companies.  I think there’s room for improvement. The world economy has changed. The fraction of the world's overall global activity, which is generated by the emerging markets is so much more than it used to be 10 or 20 years ago. The nature of the global economy is quite different now because we now have a much greater contribution from emerging markets. There is more productive capacity and more demand in the world and that is very welcome. Imagine how 2008 or 2009 would have gone without the emerging markets continuing to grow. This is very welcome but it does require us to think hard about what is going on.  You've talked there about cyclical effects. What about the structural effects, like demography and digitalisation that people say are causing these low inflationary pressures. Do you discount those as factors that are driving down inflation?  Structural factors are relevant for understanding how the economy is changing over time. But in the end, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. These are forces that can have one-off, transitory effects. But if a central bank is doing its job, it is probably not a useful approach to say that these factors permanently affect the inflation rate. Clearly, one of the big trends in the world economy is the ageing of the population. I think that ultimately has mixed effects on the inflation dynamics. For example, the shrinking of the labour force by and large could make, over time, labour more expensive. It is surely changing the bounds of consumption of different types of goods, and it has pervasive effects on the economy. But I wouldn't classify it all as working in one direction in terms of inflationary pressure.  Does it have an impact on savings rates?   I think it's definitely a force, but you have to look closely at the whole distribution. If you have a lot of people aged 40 to 60, depending on the country and its pension system that age group will tend to be orientated towards saving for retirement. As more and more people reach advanced stages of life, or maybe are dis-saving, that sign can change again. It's also important to say that household saving is just one component of overall saving along with corporate and government saving.  There is also a question about saving versus the allocation of portfolios: super-safe versus riskier assets. When people get close to retirement, their portfolio might shift towards safer assets. We think that is part of the reason why interest rates are super low: it is this kind of safety preference that is emerging. How much of this is due to demographics and how much due to people having been scarred by the financial crisis remains an open question. On digitalisation, again we think it definitely has an impact on those goods where an online presence is important. Going back to the difference between services and goods, the online dimension is, of course, quite important for particular categories of goods. But it would not be so important in setting services prices, for example: I do not think it makes a big difference to the rent you pay. Research indicates that digitalisation may also be making a difference to how firms set prices, because they have a lot more information now. Their use of pricing algorithms may mean they respond differently to changes in demand and so on. So it is changing the structure in some categories, but we do not think that it is something that is so fundamental that the monetary drivers of inflation are somehow disconnected. My basic point is that a lot of these digital developments may generate important relative price movements. We know that certain goods are a lot cheaper now than they used to be because of online searches and so on. But I am not so sure you can say that the overall inflation rate in the economy is permanently affected.  But you would say that, wouldn’t you, because if you didn’t, then what’s the point of monetary policy?  Just look around the world: you can see from the cross-section of countries the fact that there is a limit to all of these arguments. We know countries where the monetary forces are a lot looser and there is no problem with inflation getting high. When you are in this kind of low zone – where the advanced economies and many emerging markets are – where inflation is super low and interest rates and our policy instruments are already quite extended, then a negative shock to inflation is going to be more visible because we cannot instantly correct it. The policy space is such that it takes time to restore inflation back to target when you have a low inflation and a low interest rate world with relatively small, temporary shocks to inflation, which are more visible and more persistent.  So you’re not saying it hasn’t had any impact at all, you’re just saying the impact might be more visible here in Europe, where we have very low inflation…  First of all, low inflation means a small shock compared to the overall inflation rate looks bigger, and, second, our ability to quickly eliminate those shocks is less. Since 2014, the mantra of the ECB has been patience: that we are intent on getting inflation back to target. Our monetary policy remains effective and we do respond to shocks, but it does take longer when you can only do relatively small policy moves.   When you look at, geographically within the euro zone, different countries and different areas, it does seem like there are some countries where inflation is above your target, and others where it’s very low. Are there any common themes that you spot there? I know you prefer to look at the euro zone as a whole, but…  When you have a common currency, the best way to think about the differentials inside the euro area is real exchange rate adjustment. In those countries with stronger economies, you might expect to see inflation stronger and the labour market tighter. What you are seeing there is a real exchange rate appreciation among the countries. Once you eliminate the noise of national currencies, the very standard classical prediction that faster-growing countries should see real exchange rate appreciation is much more visible. The economics of the differentials within the euro area are fairly well understood, but compared to the big picture, these are quite small differentials and they are self-correcting.  This is why in the end we do look at the aggregate, because the economics of appreciation and depreciation are that, if you live in a country which persistently has inflation above the euro area aggregate, all else equal, it basically means a loss of competitiveness. Therefore, that economy will slow down and come back. Equally, a country where inflation is below the average, over time, would gain competitiveness and will climb. By and large, we think there is a self-correcting element to those differentials within the euro area. That is why the aggregate is the ECB’s responsibility. Those differentials play a very important role, but it is not fundamentally an inflation issue, it is a relative price level issue.  The current scenario that you’ve very well outlined, are there parallels between the situation we’re in now and previous points in economic history?  If you go back long enough, there are definitely periods of time when price level inflation was very low, but by and large, in many of those cases, that was a period when you had the gold standard or Bretton Woods and so on. Essentially, under Bretton Woods, the US had a monetary policy, everyone else was more or less fixing. Equally, under the gold standard, the responsibility for inflation at national level was quite different. At that level, we understand that you can have periods of very low interest rates and very low inflation rates. But in terms of the history of modern central banking, there isn’t such a clear parallel, because you had the inflationary pressures in the 1970s and the 1980s, and then the disinflation and then the convergence to around 2 in the late 1990s, early 2000s. What is different is that getting inflation back to target from below is something where the playbook is quite different to getting inflation back to target from above. That is the big challenge.  For years, it was about getting it down.  Yes. We have learnt a lot over the last six or seven years. Remember, the big pivot in the ECB was 2014. The motivation was to rule out deflation. There were signs of inflation dynamics approaching zero or even going negative. Phase 1 of the ECB’s pivot was to address that, to restore enough inflationary pressures that we would be back into sustainably positive inflation territory. Then phase 2, which has been a number of years now, not being satisfied with eliminating deflation risk but wanting to bring inflation back towards the target. The scale of excess in unemployment across Europe was so high that it took a while even for wage inflation to pick up.  There are two forces at work now. One is that as the European economy continues to grow, wage pressure is maintained. Unemployment is stabilising around 7.5%. The level of unemployment is important for wage pressure. We have persistent wage inflation now. We talked earlier on about the low likelihood of permanently squeezed profit margins at some point. Already, we see it in services inflation, we think we will have it in goods inflation as well. That is a scenario by which inflation will climb over time. The contest is between that and the fact we also know inflation is very persistent. So, if you are in a situation where firms and workers have spent several years in a world where inflation has been around 1%, then that kind of model influences their expectation of what is going to happen next year and the year after and the year after that. In other words, if inflation is low and there is a belief that it will remain low, then the incentives to raise prices come down. This is basically the conflict.  Because people expect inflation to be low, people keep inflation low?  Exactly, because if you are an individual firm saying: what happens if I raise prices and my competitors do not? Or, let’s say I have already observed in my industry that some firm raised prices last quarter, so you have seen last year’s pricing dynamics. In turn, for many firms it is going to depend on what the workers are looking for in terms of wage increases. And workers, in terms of what their representatives may ask for, often they say, well, we need to compensate for an increase in the cost of living. The ask when inflation is unexpectedly low is less than when inflation is high. There’s definitely a kind of self-reinforcing nature of inflation. That’s true at high inflation, it’s true at low inflation.   It’s sticky.  It is sticky but it is not totally immobile. It is likely that inflation is going to move up slowly and that has been our forecast. It is going to take a while. The central bank has to be sufficiently proactive in policy-making that people understand that inflation is going to rise over time. If you are indifferent, if you ignore the importance of getting inflation up over time, then you can get locked into a kind of low inflation trap. That we think would be quite dangerous. So inflation is moving up. This is why in September, there might have been a difference of views about what to do, but the importance of doing something was clear. The two-year-ahead inflation forecast had come down from 1.8 at the end of 2018 to 1.5 by September 2019.  Whose expectations are that? Is that the market expectations? Or is that companies and households?  All of it is relevant. When I talk about the inflation projection, it is basically aggregating everything in our macro models. All of it matters in different ways. Market expectation matters because the pricing of the whole financial system depends on investors, on their view. I just gave the example where it matters quite a bit what the expectations of those who are involved in setting wages are. It matters quite a bit for firms as well. But we also know, especially in the world of very low inflation, those factors are not directly controlled by the central bank. In the end, I share the view of many that the most important influence on expectations is actual inflation. Unless we get actual inflation up, we can talk as much as we like and communicate as much as we like, but in the absence of evidence that inflation is moving up, then many people will ignore the central bank’s communication.  Why does it matter if inflation is at 1.2, 1.3 percent or 1.7, 1.8 percent? Why does that matter? That doesn’t sound like a massive difference to most people in the world.   Right, so this is why it is not so easy for macroeconomics to provide intuitive answers. If you knew for sure inflation was going to be 1.0 forever, 1.5 forever, 2.0 forever, then I would agree with you: it doesn’t really matter. These are small differences, if these were fully predictable, fully certain. The dominant macro reason to be concerned is: let’s say the underlying demography, growth and others mean that the real rate of interest was zero, long-term zero. The policy space when inflation is 2 means if there’s a negative shock, we basically have 200 basis points of cutting before getting to zero compared to 100 basis points if the inflation rate were 1. There is a universal consensus that you really don’t want to get into a situation where a negative shock can drive you into deflation. Our ability to use the traditional policy tool, which is a positive policy rate, is bigger if the inflation rate is 2 than if the inflation rate is 1 or zero.  When you go out, as I’ve done recently –I wrote a piece from Mainz farmers’ market – and I asked people what they thought inflation was. They think inflation is much higher, and I think your surveys at the ECB have shown this.  Yes, there’s a lot of variation, a lot of households think it is higher.  Yes, and a big part of that seems to be the cost of housing; that in their minds, you ask them about inflation and they think about things they buy every day, so probably groceries and stuff, and they think about rent or mortgages, particularly house prices. So they think about asset prices actually, and that’s in their consciousness when you ask them about inflation. People don’t think that you’re measuring inflation properly. Is there a problem in terms of the share of housing costs? I know it’s something that’s going to be looked at in the strategic review.   Even before you get to housing, there are huge differences in the inflation rates facing individuals. Depending where you are in terms of your point in life, young versus old, depending on whether you’re in a country where you’re renting versus where you are owner-occupied, depending whether you are in a country where house prices are falling, like in Italy, versus where house prices are going up, like in northern Europe: there’s going to be a lot of variation in individual inflation rates.  In other words, there is always going to be an issue around how you come up with an aggregate measure of the cost, of consumer prices. I think we at the ECB would agree that there should be more weight on housing – but there is a difficulty and this has been looked at several times before. One issue is about the consumption element of owning a home – every day you are enjoying the services of living in your own home – versus the fact that it’s also an asset, as you say. So that dual role. Conceptually it is not an insurmountable problem, and we are going to look at it again in the review. We have to learn and review from the previous episodes of studying this issue.  Is it to do with it being too difficult to measure?  I do not want to pre-empt the review by saying that that is what we are necessarily going to conclude. It is a real issue and we have to be practical about it. The HICP is clearly our target when we set monetary policy. But we also look at many other things. For example, at one of our recent meetings, I was looking at what the inflation rate would look like if we included a measure of owner-occupied housing in the index. The inflation rate would be a little bit higher now.  How much higher?  You can read private sector estimates which I think look at around 20 to 30 basis points as of now. But let me emphasise that sometimes it goes the other way. Housing is quite cyclical, so in a downturn the inflation rate would fall more quickly because if you have a negative shock, if you look at the proxy measures that are being generated, they do fall more quickly in a recession.  It would be more hawkish, though, at the moment if you changed it to include this; then you would be more likely to raise rates sooner because inflation would be higher automatically.  Let me draw a clear line between what we look at in the strategy review and any near/medium-term policymaking. The strategy review is about what is the best approach. It should not be read as having any link back to today’s policymaking.  Do you worry about a liquidity trap? This was something that people have talked about.  This goes back to the issue of inflation expectations. If you do not provide stimulus that gets inflation back towards the target, if inflation remains low for a longer and longer period of time, and then if you have a negative shock, you run the risk of being in a situation where essentially you hit the limits of monetary policy. We don’t think we are at that point now. The ECB has been quite creative, I think, with going negative and all the different purchase programmes. And we have continued to see monetary policy being effective through the end of 2019 and into 2020. What we are doing through these policies is reducing the lending rates facing firms and households. We can do more. But clearly, we are closer to the lower bound than the Federal Reserve is. We are closer to it than we would like to be.   Can I ask you about Sweden? Their explanation of their decision has been quite limited and left a lot of people frustrated as to exactly why they’ve chosen to do this when it seems like their economy isn’t strengthening enough to justify it. I think they said that the longer you have negative interest rates, there’s a fear that it starts to have an impact on the behaviour of households and companies. Do you fear that?  It is an interesting issue, the economics of low interest rates – whether they are a bit above or a bit below zero – and then I think there is something special about the economics of going negative. We are always clear: we do recognise that there are potential side effects, and in the review we are going to look at that. Sweden’s inflation rate is closer to target than the ECB’s inflation rate is. We look forward to a day when we can get out of negative rates. At some point, the comparison of benefits and costs is going to change – that is true. It is a lot easier to make that decision when inflation is closer to 2 percent, as in Sweden, than when it is still too far away, as it is here.  When you say that there’s a difference in the economics of negative rates as opposed to low interest rates, and the world changes a bit, what are you referring to?  Well, first of all the ability of banks to pass these rates on. Second, whether more and more households conclude that they need to save more, not save less.  But deposits at banks have shot up ever since the negative rates were introduced.  The question is how much of that is down to more and more people entering their pre-retirement phase. So I am not so sure how much this is directly related to interest rates. It fundamentally differs across countries, according to pension systems. The fact that more people are in work and that debtors get a break, and governments get a break on their debt servicing – that outweighs the fact that relatively wealthy people in a few countries may respond differently to low rates.   Mario Draghi said the main reason why inflation is so much higher in the United States than it is in the euro zone is to do with fiscal policy.  Broadly speaking, if we were to have the same fiscal policy as the United States, then yes, inflation would be a lot higher.   Well, you’re seeing a bit more from Europeans now, even if it’s only baby steps.  Yes, it is visible, it definitely is making a difference.  I don’t know if you’ve read what my colleague, Martin Sandbu, wrote about monetary policy affecting supply versus demand, but I’d be interested in your views. It struck me as quite an interesting way to look at it.  Yes, it is something we would think about quite a bit as well. Historically, there was always a nice clean separation, which is that supply is just driven by technology, by innovation, by demography. Monetary policy, and demand in general, matter in the short run but fade away. But when you have a persistent phase of low demand, I think it can have a long-lasting effect. There is a recent paper by Alan Taylor and some others, which shows that the effects of monetary policy are visible in the supply data even ten years later. If failing to deliver an effective monetary policy has long-lasting damaging effects on supply that reinforces the importance of doing monetary policy well. I agree with that. And just think about the counterfactual. Imagine what the supply potential of Europe would look like if the ECB had not provided monetary accommodation in the last six or seven years. We know employment has gone up, so just think about the supply capacity of people. If more people spent the last six years unemployed than employed, that would…  You’re talking about 11 million people...  Yes, that would damage employment. Without that demand, investment would have been a lot lower and, therefore, the stock of capital in the economy would also be lower. I am pretty sure that, in the absence of ECB policy over these last years, the long-term productive capacity of Europe would be lower. At the same time, and this is why it is a nuanced debate, there is a school of thought which argues that easy monetary conditions are preventing a shake-out of unproductive firms.  The zombie companies…  Well, zombie is a catchy way of thinking about it! That is an interesting perspective, which I think you have to quantitatively compare with the fact that a kind of suffocation of demand is not good for the long-term potential.  So your overall message is basically that it’s working; monetary policy is working, you believe it has an effect. We’re in this extraordinary post-double crisis period which is going to last for a bit longer, but it’s working, it’s just going to work slowly and we need to be patient.  The fact that we have this global low inflation environment also means: if there is a turn, there could be a global turn in a synchronised way. This is not necessarily just a question of time. It could be a change in the state of the world. So our forward guidance leaves open the possibility that we should be appropriately humble about knowing the timeline. I don’t think everything is so certain that you can say this is all on a set course. I think there are downside risks, and while I would not like to call the forces that raise inflation upside risks, because they may be bad news for the global economy like de-globalisation. But there could be forces that are inflationary that could kick in – trade and geopolitical forces.  That could be good for inflation but not great for the economy?  Yes. I also think we should revisit the issue of energy prices. Historically, I think the price of energy has always been very important in the overall dynamic. If the world does adopt more transition-friendly policies that means that the consumer price of energy trends upwards. That could be a force that contributes to inflation dynamics. The narrative of ‘everything inevitably low for longer’ – there is a lot of weight to that –, but I do not put all my probability on it. You should watch out for other forces.   "
2020-01-24,Christine Lagarde,Interview with Bloomberg TV,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua and broadcast on 24 January","  Interview with Bloomberg TV   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua and broadcast on 24 January 24 January 2020   We are delighted to be joined right here on Bloomberg by the European Central Bank President. She's Christine Lagarde. Madame Lagarde, thank you so much for giving us a little bit of your busy schedule. When you look at the strategy review event, you really laid out what you were trying to achieve yesterday in the press conference. At this moment, what do you see as the biggest challenge for it?  The biggest challenge is going to be to harness all the views, all the assessments, all the convictions into a direction that will actually serve the purpose that we have been assigned, which is guaranteed price stability in the economy. Now, that seems like a very dry proposal but the whole point is to actually create the ground, maintain the ground and fertilise the ground – so that there is growth, so that there are jobs, and so that the economies of the euro area are working well and hopefully are generating some good value for the citizens of the euro area. That's the purpose.  You said that you have a preference on how you would look at inflation, but you wouldn't say why.  Now, I have a preference on many topics. I have views and I'm not an idiot. Yes, I do have views in relation to how we can procure this price stability, how financial stability has to be taken into account, how we take into account the risks of climate change and the impact that it has on many aspects of the work that we've been doing. I do have those views, and all the people around the table have those views. I think my job as President is to facilitate the expression, the rallying of views around various themes, one of which will be the inflation objective-setting, if you will – which may take multiple forms – but which is one of the anchors that will determine our discussions. But I don't think that a President right from the get-go, as we are just about to embark on the process, should state; this is my view. I don't want to preclude others from expressing theirs and I don't want to over-influence the debate.  Is it about the consensus building, or is it just about not influencing?  Lagarde: It's a combination of both. There are very strong members around the table and I don't think that they will be under any kind of influence other than reviewing the facts, understanding the reactions, understanding the response, understanding the effectiveness of what we can do. The world has changed so dramatically over the last 20… you know, last time we had a strategy review was in 2003. The growth was much higher in those days, inflation was higher, the prospects for the various demographics around the world were different. The world has massively changed. We didn't use social media as much as we do; we hardly had the cell phone in those days.  Can you give us, then, a sense of the future timetable for these reviews? Should it be a regular thing?  That's to be debated. First of all, the initial timetable that we are setting for ourselves – which is ambitious, I acknowledge that – is to try to conclude before the end of this year. So December 2020, hopefully, we will have reached that platform of consensus on the various topics that we have. Now, do we have to repeat the exercise every five years, every eight years, every 16 years, as we have? I have my views as well and we will debate that with the group to see how necessary it is, how helpful it can be.  Markets are interpreting the exercise as maybe having a little bit of a dovish tilt. Then you look at housing costs and you look maybe at side effects of negative rates…  I'm an owl; I'm not a dove, I'm not a hawk!  You're an owl.  There are doves and hawks around the table, I get it!  But what signs should markets be looking at in the review to give us a sense of where it goes?  If markets are interested in what happens in the next 12 months, they should not pay too much attention to the strategy review because we're conducting two separate exercises here. We will have our monetary policy assessment and review as usual. Every six weeks we all get together, we look at the numbers, we look at the markets, we look at the views of the citizens in terms of inflation expectations. We decide whether things should be status quo or whether they should vary one way or the other. That exercise will be conducted irrespective of the strategy review, so to those who say, “Oh, it's going to be completely static and stable for 12 months”, I'd say, watch out! Because things change and we might have different signals and we might reconsider. We might. I don't know at this point in time. What I know for sure is that there will be two different exercises and the strategy review will be on its own, on a standalone basis, and will progress. We are looking at what we do in the future, not what we do next week, or in May or in July.  Is it also a warning to the markets not to over interpret too quickly?  They always over interpret. They're going to look at my face and see, well, is she smiling? Is she “dovish”? Is she hawkish? I told them on day one: I said, “Don't over interpret. We will say what we can say.” I know that some people are disappointed that we didn’t say much more yesterday, but a strategy review starts here, finishes there. You cannot here say what you are going to do there; otherwise you don't do a strategy review. We need to do a lot of stock-taking, looking at the effectiveness of what we have done, learning from other countries around the world as well in the process. You know that the Fed is undergoing the same exercise, and we need to take time to reach out to the Parliament, to academics, to people, to those who are interested in these issues to hear the voices, to understand what their views are. We will listen to markets as well, but they are one of the voices that we will listen to.  Economists believe that monetary policy at the ECB will be largely on autopilot for the next two years: is that a mistake?  No, I just told you – as to those who think that it's on autopilot, I think that's ridiculous. There is forward guidance which is strong, which is setting a very clear timetable that is fact-dependent. But let's look at the facts, let's look at how the economy evolves. That's what we do; we need to be fact-driven, we need to be clear in our communication and we will be. I'm saying today: don't assume that it will be on autopilot.  Yesterday you talked quite extensively about negative rates; you said tiering is working well, but is there a point where actually the side effects of negative rates mean that you need to scale it back?  We will be looking at the side effects as part of the strategy review. There is no question about that. We need to be attentive to that. Financial stability is not our first driver of concern and consideration, but we will have to look at it, of course, yes. Don't forget that we need to have a banking sector in the euro area that acts as a good channel of transmission.  Which means what, that you could extend tiering?  Multiple responses! As I said yesterday, we are not considering that at the moment.  President Trump left Davos saying that actually he's still thinking about possible tariffs against Germany and Europe in general. You're seeing growth in Europe; how do you match up the two?  We're saying modest growth in Europe. We're saying a bit more modest downside risks as well, so that's probably the reason why it's kind of slightly balanced to the upside, but very slightly. We shall see. What I was pleased about is to see that there had been a good first meeting between Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and President Trump. It's better to start off on a good footing and there will be difficult relationships going forward, and points of negotiation that will be hard. Whether it's trade, whether it's tax, whether it's technology, whether it's energy – there are multiple topics. As Ursula said, Europe and the United States have been friends for a long, long time. It will not go away and in many instances, they have joint interests but Europe is different. Europe operates on different values, with different systems, and that needs to be secured and preserved for the sake of the Europeans.  Are tariffs the biggest concern you see for the European economy?  It's a big concern, let's face it. Don't forget that there is trade intra-Europe and that would not indeed be affected. But trade with the United States, which is an important trade partner, would be affected if there was a sudden rise in tariffs, yes – or a tariff war. Tit for tat, you tariff me, I'll tariff you: that's going to operate as a brake on the economy, for sure.  You've done a number of public events in the last couple of weeks. What concerns have people raised with you?  You know, it varies. When I talk to family members, they say, “Explain what you do, Mum, please? We don't really understand!” That's a really good signal for me that we need to communicate in a more explicit way about what we procure. If we explain exactly what we do, it's technically sound – the experts will understand. Family members and the taxi drivers, the hairdressers and the shopkeepers are not going to understand. If we explain that what we do actually procures growth, facilitates investment and creates jobs, then it means something. But we should not be the only one to try to do that!  Is it reconnecting with the citizens?  I think that's an important factor, yes, because people of Europe – particularly the euro area – are quite bullish about the euro. They are pleased to have the euro as their currency. And we do everything we can to make sure that euros can flow easily, that payments are secure, that what they have is solid, is stability. But I think we need to do a bit more.  A lot of the focus here is on sustainability. You talked about sustainability.  Yes.  Is there a danger that we have outsized expectations about what central banks can do to tackle this?  Possibly, but I think that nonetheless, each and every one of us has to explore what he or she can do about the current risks. I think that it has been under… The risks caused by climate change to corporates, to the economy, to general stability have been largely underestimated – and for good reasons, because many risks are difficult to assess. We are talking about what happens in 30 years. It's not on the cards of a stress tester to anticipate what happens in 30 years. You look at the immediate future, you look at the market risks, you look at macro risks. But the climate risks in 30 years, that need action now if we want to remedy those risks, that's difficult – but we need to do it, absolutely.  Do you worry that the more questions you ask…  Lagarde: And by the way, central bankers can do quite a bit.  Like what? If you force, for example, financial institutions or ask for them to stress test climate change, how much complexity does that actually. How much cost does it involve and how many more complex issues come up to the surface because of the exercise?  I say never mind the cost; beware of the accident, number one, so even if it costs something, the risk that it protects us against is so much bigger that it's really worth a bit of investment. And it's also a source of economic opportunities, let's not forget that. That's where everybody has to rally at the table because it requires good and probably different accounting principles. I'm delighted that the big accounting firms are taking this seriously, and I hope they deliver. It requires the regulators to be on board as well. But the policymakers, the governments have to take it seriously and not pay lip service to the risk. They have to also take the right measures, so everybody must be at the table. Central bankers will not eliminate climate risk on their own. They can participate in the process and for my money, I'll do the best I can to participate, but it's not a business of central banks.  Do chief executives and governments take it seriously, or is there a danger that they come to Davos, and talk about it…  The governments have to take it seriously. They all signed up to the Paris Agreement. Not many countries are at the point of beginning to deliver.  If you see a recession or if you see it tilted downwards for the economy, is there a danger that actually all of this goodwill goes out the window?  We've seen that in the past and we might see it in the future, but I think that the youth around us and public opinion will be around to remind us that this is not something that we can put on the back burner, because we have an issue.  What is the one thing that you would ask of the European Commission when it comes to tackling climate change right now? Do we need a common definition? Is it carbon pricing?  It's not just the European Commission; I think the European Commission is completely devoted to this. And the Green Deal, as advocated by Ursula von der Leyen, is really a good – I would say – “repurposing” of a lot of existing budgets and additional budgets and probably new financial instruments to guarantee and leverage. But it also takes the European Parliament and they are heading in the right direction, identifying a taxonomy, without which it would be difficult for others to move and say; here we need to take a provision. That collateral is not really worth what’s on the face of it.  Is this one issue you think Europe can speak with a common voice on?  I would hope so. I know it's difficult. There are some countries that are still heavily coal-dependent but I would hope so. Just as Europe has moved, and is moving the world, on Data Protection, as it also has moved the world in relation to safety. Everybody complained about REACH at the time. REACH was this legislation that actually helped better regulate chemicals that could be dangerous for people. There are a lot of goods that are used on a daily basis around the world that are safer because of that Directive. So in that sense, Europe – which is often criticised for being too bureaucratic, too government-intensive – is also helping people.  But is this one thing that will deliver the real fiscal spending that you and your predecessor have been asking for, for a long time?  Well, I'm watching! I don't have a voice concerning fiscal policy, so to speak, but I have a voice to say; our monetary policy is much more effective if you leash out, where you have the space, on some fiscal tools as well. When I look at some countries, they are beginning to put money on the table.  Christine Lagarde, I know you have to go, so a final question: if you look at the central bank stance around the world, there is a lot of talk that central banks are coming to the end of the tools that they have. Can somehow fiscal spending across the world make up for that?  First of all, I don't think that the central banks have exhausted their tools. When conventional policy was heading towards very low rates, then new tools were invented. These were challenged but eventually they were validated. So I think that creativity also applies to central banking, number 1. Number 2, they won't be a substitute; I think it's a coordination, an amplification of one by the other.  If you look at how markets have reacted, do you worry that they're out of kilter actually, so markets are going up and the world economy is in a little bit of a standstill?  There are times when I think so.  Is that because they don't price risk?  I think that some of them clearly do not price the climate change risk, for sure, yes.  Christine Lagarde, thank you so much for joining us.    "
2020-01-24,Christine Lagarde,Interview with France 2,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Paul Chapel","   INTERVIEW 24 January 2020  Interview with France 2   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Paul Chapel  Good morning, Christine Lagarde. This is your first television interview in France since taking up your new position at the European Central Bank in November. Thank you for giving it to France 2 and Télématin. French people knew you as the Minister of Economy and then as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). And now, as head of the ECB, you have an even more powerful role and the financial markets scrutinise everything you say. Do you have to weigh every word?   You have to speak sparingly enough for your message to remain solid and credible. And central bankers obviously have to be careful in sending out signals because financial markets and analysts are watching and will draw certain conclusions in order to decipher what they should focus their efforts on and where they should move their funds to.   Let me briefly touch on France. Today is a day of strikes in protest against the pension reform which will be presented to the cabinet today. Are you in favour of this pension reform?   At the moment I am not in a position to assess the structure of the text. In terms of price stability, of the main economic indicators, we know it’s important for each and every citizen to have enough certainty as to what will happen when they retire in 10, 15 or 20 years’ time. So any reform that helps bring about that certainty and clarifies the future retirement landscape, and which does not generate any inequality, will be good for economic policy and for monetary policy. And that applies to all products involving future payment or returns.  Turning to monetary policy now, to the interest rates that are set by the ECB. These interest rates are persistently low, practically zero. So Europeans are earning next to nothing on their savings. In France, the interest rate on the Livret A is 0.5% and the return on life insurance is not much better. Inflation is eroding the savings of those on the lowest incomes.  That’s true. Both rates need to be seen in parallel: the rate of return and the rate of inflation. Above all, we need to ask why the rates are low. We are in an environment, in Europe but also in all of the advanced economies, where the rates are generally low and have fallen considerably over the past decade. So a readjustment is now taking place. Why are they low? Because the central banks’ mandate is to preserve price stability, and in particular to prevent us from slipping into deflation. To that end, they have to try to support the economy, to facilitate lending to firms and to encourage households to invest. For example, the cost of financing for young couples who want to buy their first apartment is extremely low at the moment, lower than it has ever been before. The same goes for firms wishing to invest in new production equipment, the rates have never been so low. Our current task is to encourage investment rather than to support savings at all costs. Investors are in a better position these days.   As you say, the situation is bad for savers but good for borrowers. For example, interest rates are even negative for countries like France – or even for corporations – if they want to borrow for a ten-year period. The more you borrow, the richer you get – it does seem to be the wrong way round.  It’s not a case of the more you borrow, the richer you get. It’s rather the more you borrow, the more you can improve your production equipment. And that goes for households when they buy a new apartment; for firms when they invest in new production equipment, when they increase their productivity; and for governments. It all depends on what you do with the money you borrow. First of all, you should borrow if you have the capacity to do so or if you have sufficient fiscal room for manoeuvre. But borrowing to invest in education, to invest in new technologies, to invest in research and development, to improve the factors of production in general, that’s a good investment, because it strengthens the economy and, by boosting growth, paves the way for job creation and improves the situation of households.   And to invest in ecological transition. At the European Central Bank, you want to tackle climate issues, which is something new. You have mentioned the “danger of doing nothing”, so, in a nutshell, what will you do?  We’re going to look at all the tools we have at our disposal: economic analysis, supervision – since part of the ECB looks after banking supervision – and the investments that we make in the context of some of our programmes, either on our own behalf or in the portfolio that we manage within the framework of the accommodative monetary policy that has been in place for several years. We’re going to look at how we can facilitate the identification of risk. That means that if you take a financial product, you won’t just take it at face value. You’re going to ask whether the company in question has considered climate-related risks. Has it asked what will happen if, in 5, 10 or 20 years, the assets have completely changed in value?  One final, quick question: your animal emblem, which I can see on your jacket, is the owl. What does that signify?  It signifies that I am neither a dove nor a hawk…  Neither lax nor orthodox.  Neither lax nor orthodox. We will try to combine our collective wisdom to define a monetary policy that is good for Europeans and that allows us to achieve, as I said before, price stability, growth and investment capacity, in the most low-carbon environment possible.  Thank you for your time. We wish you and all our viewers a very good day.    "
2020-01-08,Christine Lagarde,Interview with “Challenges” magazine,"Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, by Pierre-Henri de Menthon and Sabine Syfuss-Arnaud","   INTERVIEW 8 January 2020  Interview with “Challenges” magazine   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, by Pierre-Henri de Menthon and Sabine Syfuss-Arnaud  You have described yourself as neither a dove nor a hawk, but rather an owl. Why exactly this rather unusual type of bird?  Owls are traditionally seen as birds of wisdom that can see well in the dark and have a wide range of vision. However, what I really wanted to highlight was my wish to ensure that discussions within the Governing Council take place in an efficient, of course, but also composed manner.  What, in your view, does 2020 have in store for us? What is the greatest threat to the global economy?  We would anticipate a growth rate of around 1.1% in the euro area for 2020, which is slightly lower than in 2019. Both within the euro area and globally, the biggest threat is a downturn in trade resulting from a range of uncertainties, primarily affecting manufacturing and hampering investment. This range of uncertainties, in addition to geopolitical risks and issues relating to climate change, includes ongoing trade tensions and Brexit.  Will Europe be weakened as a result of Brexit?  Following the recent elections in the United Kingdom and the approval by the House of Commons of the withdrawal agreement, the UK is due to leave the European Union on 31 January 2020. This means one less uncertainty, which is good news for investors. That said, the biggest challenge is yet to come – namely the issue of reaching a trade deal between London and the EU during the 11‑month transition period. The economic and financial impact of Brexit will depend on the details of that agreement – if indeed one can be reached – during that short period of time. However, what we do know is that, as a result of Brexit, the European Union will lose a wealthy Member State and one that is a powerful military force. The EU will recover, but will need to bolster its efforts to compensate for the UK’s departure.  You have moved from Washington to Frankfurt. Can you explain the difference in growth between the United States and the euro area, where Germany’s role as an “engine of growth” appears to be losing momentum?  The difference is largely due to economic policy choices – the United States has seen a significant fiscal stimulus, whereas Europe has not. The United States is less restricted, fiscally-speaking, and enjoys the privilege of the US dollar’s international position. The US was also able to restore the health of its financial sector at an earlier stage following the crisis. However, the EU is still the most powerful economic and trading area in the world, with enormous potential. It has also shown that it was able to recover from the crisis and create new employment after two recessions, particularly thanks to the measures taken by the ECB. A concerted fiscal stimulus at the euro area level would help speed up growth, which at 1.1% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021 (according to our latest projections) remains below our potential, at least for 2020.  What do you mean when you refer to a “new policy mix” for Europe?  It makes sense to use all of the tools at our disposal when it comes to increasing growth, which will also result in inflation moving towards levels close to 2%. There are three elements to this policy mix: monetary policy, which has continuously been used to maintain price stability; fiscal policy, which should be used more often in order to support monetary policy in Member States where possible; and structural reforms to increase the growth potential within our economies. Greater cooperation between competent authorities, without infringing on the independence of their roles, would make it possible to optimise the multiplier effects of their decisions.  The ECB’s policy is pushing economic operators into debt. French public debt is now in excess of 100% of GDP. Should we be worried?  Although public debt is decreasing within the euro area, in France, it is increasing. This is a cause for concern, since it does reduce the room for fiscal manoeuvre in the event of a downturn in the economy. France needs to take steps to reduce its deficit and debt, while adopting a growth-friendly fiscal policy. Other countries have managed to achieve this difficult task. I am confident that the French government will also be able to do so, particularly through structural reforms.  In your role as Managing Director of the IMF, you were often critical of Germany’s surpluses. To what extent has this changed?  Primarily in terms of current account surpluses – but not just with regard to Germany. Such high surpluses in relation to GDP result in imbalances, particularly where a single currency is concerned.  Given the major challenge posed by populism, how can the ECB be brought closer to the citizens?  This is one of my priorities. Bringing the ECB closer to the people requires dialogue and explanations. We need to engage with our fellow citizens and enter into dialogue with them. We need to explain to them – also through you – what the ECB does and that we are committed to doing its work effectively. We should bear in mind that three-quarters of euro area citizens are in favour of the euro.  Your mandate is to ensure price stability. Is this the main issue today?  Doesn’t asking the question imply an assumption that price stability has been maintained? I would take that to be a compliment for the ECB. Indeed, since the introduction of the euro, annual inflation has averaged around 1.7% in the euro area. However, inflation currently stands at 1% and inflation projections are still low, at some distance from the level of below, but close to, 2% that we would like to reach over the medium-term.  The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has presented her “Green Deal”. How will it interact with ECB policy? Are you going to transform the ECB into a green bank?  I commend the determination of my friend, Ursula von der Leyen, and her commitment to the environment. This battle is to our credit in Europe, with all of us acting within our remits. In this, I also include the European Investment Bank. We will play our part within the framework of our mandate of maintaining price stability and of banking supervision. What effects do climate-related risks have on our growth and inflation projections? What signals do we send through our bond purchases and what assets are held by the banks that we supervise? The stakes are high enough to arouse a keen interest in these questions, while pursuing our primary mission. As regards monetary policy, the review of our strategy will be the ideal time to address these questions.  Given the low or even negative interest rates, are savers right to be worried about their savings?  The measures taken aim to maintain stable prices. In the medium to long term, this ensures the best possible economic environment and the preservation of purchasing power for all, whether savers or borrowers. Interest rates are instruments rather than objectives in themselves. There have been times in Europe when savers invested in money market funds that delivered high returns, such as at the start of the 1990s. But the monetary environment of that period penalised borrowers and the situation at that time resulted in a deep economic recession. In a recession, savers tend to reduce their savings in an effort to maintain their level of consumption. In other words, a recession is bad for savings. Negative interest rates aim to keep the economy on a balanced growth path and to avoid a recession.  Isn’t it a little shocking that banks could charge for holding deposits?  It would be shocking if the banks did not take full advantage of the historical monetary conditions that they are benefiting from to provide more funding to the real economy. But negative interest rates have been useful and progress has been made. In spring 2014, just before the rate on the deposit facility was reduced into negative territory, lending to the real economy was declining with all that that entailed, such as the risk of an economic downturn and deflation. Today it is growing at about 3.5% per year.  Specifically, it is not just countries, but firms and households too, that are living off credit. Are we witnessing the creation of “bubbles”, in particular property bubbles?  Overall, not in the euro area as a whole, although the work of the European Systemic Risk Board, which I chair, and the ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review call for prudence and the implementation of targeted macroprudential measures, which are sometimes necessary at the national level.  Can the euro take advantage of the current turmoil to gain ground on the world stage?  I share the European Commission’s view that there is indeed room for the euro to further develop its international role in line with the economic and financial importance of the euro area. But, ultimately, it’s the economic agents who determine whether this takes place. Of course, we will help strengthen the international role of the euro by being credible in what we do, by making the euro area more robust, by completing banking union and the capital markets union, and by continuing to innovate in the field of payments.  Is creating a cryptocurrency a legitimate task for the ECB?  Innovation in the area of payments is racing ahead in response to the urgent demand for quicker and cheaper payments, especially cross-border ones. The Eurosystem in general and the ECB in particular want to play an active role in this field, rather than just acting as observers of a changing world. In 2018 the Eurosystem launched an infrastructure to provide pan-European instant payments with direct settlement in central bank money (TIPS, i.e. TARGET Instant Payment Settlement). This enables banks to process payments between themselves in a matter of seconds, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, all over Europe. This caters not only to the preferences of younger generations, who want to make round-the-clock payments with their smartphones, but also to firms, which want to optimise payment and supply chain processes. In terms of the road ahead, the ECB will continue to assess the costs and benefits of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that would ensure that the general public remains able to use central bank money even if the use of physical cash eventually declines. However, the prospect of central bank initiatives should neither discourage nor crowd out private market-led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area. We are looking closely into the feasibility and merits of a CBDC, also because it could have major implications for the financial sector and for the transmission of monetary policy. At the end of 2019 we created an expert task force at the ECB that will work closely with the national central banks to study the feasibility of a euro area CBDC in various forms, covering all the practical aspects, including how to minimise possible unintended side-effects.  You left France in 2011 – do you miss it?  Wherever I am, France is always close to my heart!   "
2019-12-16,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Libération,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean Quatremer on 4 December, and published on 16 December 2019","   INTERVIEW 16 December 2019  Interview with Libération   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean Quatremer on 4 December, and published on 16 December 2019  On 25 September, Sabine Lautenschläger, the German member of the Executive Board, resigned after the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), Europe’s “quantitative easing”, was reactivated on 13 September following a majority decision of the Governing Council. Several other ECB members also voted against, and the governors of the German, Austrian and Dutch central banks openly criticised this decision. What happened?  In September, the euro area was facing the risk of a further slowdown and inflation was remaining too far away from our 2% objective. The entire Governing Council agreed on this diagnosis – the debate was not about the need to act, but about the choice of instruments. Some of us were not convinced that relaunching asset purchases was the most suitable instrument, because long-term interest rates had never been so low. It’s normal for there to be different points of view, but once a decision has been taken, we should accept it and move on. In fact, that’s one of the ECB’s greatest qualities – that it can take decisions by simple majority, making it more reactive than other European institutions. Not everyone has to be in agreement, although it’s better when they are as that gives the decision more weight.  A technical debate that nevertheless resulted in an open and intense confrontation…  Sabine resigned for a combination of personal reasons, and only she can comment on them. Another relevant topic is communication. I think that once the institution has taken a decision, whatever your personal opinion you should defend that decision. Things would be different if the votes were public, which is something I’ve always supported. Each individual would have to take responsibility for their vote and explain how it was in the interest of the euro area – the national central bank governors sit in Frankfurt in a personal capacity and should support the collective interest, not just their country’s.  Since the start of the euro area crisis in 2010, the Bundesbank has routinely voted against the ECB’s decisions, criticised them publicly, even joined legal actions against it…  The Governing Council was almost unanimous in its agreement that the measures taken during the crisis were both necessary and within the ECB’s mandate. I’m thinking particularly about the decision on Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) that we took in September 2012 to protect the euro area from speculation that could have forced some countries out of the single currency. That decision was almost unanimous; the single vote against came from the President of the Bundesbank, who thought these operations crossed the line separating monetary and fiscal policy as it was designed to support a euro area country’s bond market that was under attack from the markets. This was not the opinion of the Governing Council, which had spent the entire summer of 2012 ensuring that this line would not be crossed – we therefore made our intervention conditional on the activation of a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) adjustment programme. That is essential, because it means it is not the ECB that is reforming a country’s economy or getting a country’s public finances back on their feet when it asks for help – the country has to do this itself within the framework of an ESM programme. Then the ECB can provide the liquidity that enables the bond market to stabilise. Moreover, the European Court of Justice ruled in our favour.  We seem to be witnessing a real clash of ideologies between the left and right within the ECB, as your zero-rates policy is resulting in the “euthanisation of the rentier”, to borrow a 19th century phrase, meaning it’s hurting savers and pensioners, hence the criticism from Germany and the Netherlands, but helping workers, or growth, in other words.  It’s a false dichotomy. One of my regrets is that we haven’t managed to convince the German public of the merits of our policy. On the one hand, monetary policy always and everywhere affects the balance between saving and consumption via interest rates. If it didn’t do that, it would serve no purpose! And on the other hand, in a period where unemployment skyrockets, growth slows or there is the threat of deflation, as was the case in 2012 and 2014, it is normal for the ECB to be on the side of employment. I have no concerns here, it’s part of our mandate: without growth and employment, you cannot have price stability. Our policy is in the interest of the euro area as a whole, and therefore of Germany, it’s as simple as that. As soon as you have a single market and a single currency, there’s no point artificially setting the interests of different countries against each other, because we are all in the same boat…   Your policies have also weakened the banks, who have seen their margins shrink to the point that some of them are no longer concerned about charging for deposits.  On the one hand, interest rates are not low because of the ECB. Us lowering our “key rates” (for example, the rate at which bank deposits held with the ECB are remunerated) to very low or even negative levels means that there is a savings glut in the economy: the natural rate of interest has fallen due to weak growth, the ageing population and a sort of anxiety in the global economy leading to demand for very safe assets, like government bonds. But for monetary policy to work and stimulate the economy, the interest rates set by the central bank have to be below this equilibrium rate. If one wants to return to a situation in which savings generate returns and conditions are supportive for the financial sector, criticising the central bank achieves nothing. Action needs to be taken on the fundamentals to boost returns on capital, which would naturally lead to interest rates increasing, and the central bank could follow.  On the other hand, it is true that the fact that the yield curve is flat, in other words that interest rates are low across the maturity spectrum, is weighing on the financial sector. Indeed, the difference between the long-term performance of savings and the short-term cost of funding is currently almost zero. But what is weighing even more heavily on the profitability of European banks is that they have a cost base that is much higher than that of banks in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, and that, in certain countries, they have non-performing loans on their balance sheet that no longer yield a return. And finally, there are too many banks in Europe and consolidation has not started.  So, we need fewer banks in the euro area?  The banking union hasn’t yet enabled consolidation within the sector. We need to see cross-border M&A activity in the banking sector, and we also need to overcome a number of obstacles to banking activity. But the banking union has played a useful role in stabilising a sector that is now much more robust than it was in 2012, since the ECB has taken on the role of banking supervisor and has strengthened capital and liquidity requirements. It is important to recognise that one of the major achievements of the past eight years has been to reduce the influence of the banking lobby. The banking union has put a stop to the vicious triangle that existed in each country between big banks, the regulator – in other words, the finance ministry – and the supervisor, which was generally the national central bank. We have created some distance between the banking sector and the supervisor, which is a good thing for the people of Europe.   Another effect of your monetary policy has been to create the conditions for a new real estate bubble, since there’s no longer any return on savings.  There is a risk, but we’re not there yet. There are local tensions, but nothing that affects the euro area as a whole. Preventing risks has to start at the national level – if property prices are soaring in a particular city, is the problem related to mortgage lending or is it related to land-use planning? In the latter case, that certainly falls outside the ECB’s purview. Financial institutions are fundamentally stronger than they were in 2008, because they’re better capitalised and they have to comply with stricter rules, particularly when it comes to measuring their risks. For example, Basel III has imposed limits on banks’ use of internal models – previously, they could calculate themselves the risks they were taking, and this made them overconfident. That said, if we remain in this environment of low interest rates for a long time, the risk of real estate bubbles will of course increase. I would like the ECB to develop an approach which allows a better comparison between the benefits for the real economy of low interest rates and the risks created through the financial sector. At the moment, it’s not clear at what point the risks start to outweigh the benefits.  Isn’t there also a need to strengthen the rules that banks need to observe when granting a loan?   Macroprudential tools offer scope to tighten capital requirements for banks and the conditions they impose on borrowers if financial stability problems appear to be emerging. Such measures are taken at the national level – in France, for example, the High Council for Financial Stability, which is chaired by the Finance Minister, has taken measures related to lending to large firms and to housing loans. If the ECB thinks that a country isn’t doing enough, it can take matters into its own hands. The European Systemic Risk Board identifies risks and can make recommendations to individual countries, but if the ECB thinks that this doesn’t go far enough, it can take charge and impose additional requirements at the European level, something that has so far never been done. The area where no tools exist – and this is a matter of concern – is non-bank activity. Since the financial crisis, there has been a shift towards the non-bank sector. Banks have shrunk their balance sheets while investment funds, money market funds and asset managers continue to grow and are effectively financing the economy. So, if an investment fund buys a portfolio of loans from a bank, it becomes a creditor to firms and households. Yet there is much less supervision and fewer prudential tools in this sector. This is where major work will be needed in the coming years – we need to develop a macroprudential approach for non-bank activity so that credit conditions can be tightened if necessary.  Since you started at the ECB in January 2012, the institution has undergone a fundamental transformation. It used to be much like the Bundesbank, but now it acts more like the US Federal Reserve.  The existential crises we went through, first with Spain and Italy in summer 2012 and then with Greece in summer 2015, and the actions of one man, Mario Draghi, who was President of the ECB until November this year, gave us the necessary maturity to make full use of the instruments granted to us by the treaties. Does this mean that we have become like the Federal Reserve? In a certain sense, yes, because we are equipped with a comprehensive toolbox to support the euro area economy at all times, using tools like quantitative easing inspired by the US model, and the capacity to intervene in the markets. But there are also significant differences. For a start, we don’t have the same mandate – the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate that gives equal weighting to price stability and full employment, while the ECB’s mandate prioritises price stability. And our financial markets are not the same – bond markets in the United States are very deep and liquid, which gives the Federal Reserve an almost unlimited capacity for intervention. In Europe, there is no capital markets union – bond markets are fragmented across 19 countries, which limits the capacity of monetary policy.   Are you proud of what has been accomplished?  There are three things I take pride in. First, Mario Draghi’s speech in July 2012, when he said that the ECB, within its mandate, would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, and the creation of Outright Monetary Transactions, which were the concrete manifestation of that commitment and made it possible to maintain the integrity of the euro area. Then there was the episode with Greece, which was of course very controversial, as can be seen in the Costa Gavras film “Adults in the room”. But when the Greek government was close to bankruptcy, we ensured the continued financing of the Greek economy and of Greek banks – which had lost access to the markets and to their own savers following a capital flight – while respecting the political will of euro area governments that the assistance to Greece should be conditional. Our actions ultimately allowed Greece to remain in the euro. There were those who wanted to make the ECB responsible for Greece leaving the euro area, but we resisted that! And the third thing I’m proud of is the quantitative easing we launched in 2015, which averted the risk of deflation.   Any regrets?  We probably started quantitative easing (QE) a little too late, though I’m not blaming anyone. It was a major innovation which required an immense effort of persuasion within the Governing Council. For example, we had long discussions as to who would bear the risk of these asset purchases and we finally decided that 80% would be borne by the national central banks on their balance sheets and not by the ECB. The idea was to prevent QE, a massive purchase of public securities – we now hold almost a third of total European debt, equivalent to 20% of euro area GDP – from being a way of ushering in a fiscal union through the back door against the wishes of Member States. We also underestimated the impact that the policy of fiscal austerity would have on activity; this policy was enshrined in the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance and was necessary at the time in order to provide stability to the financial markets. But this would have required a more accommodative monetary policy, as recommended by the IMF, going as far as QE, which should have been running from 2010 rather than from 2015. Finally, we may have sat on the fence for slightly too long with regard to climate change, even if that is not our core task. Other central banks, such as the Bank of England, became aware of it earlier than we did. For one, climate change needs to be integrated into financial sector supervision, taking into account the risks it poses for certain sectors of activity and financial securities, and we need to reflect on its consequences for monetary policy. And then there were other errors that were not of our making: one reason for the deterioration of the crisis in the euro area was that we lagged far behind the United States in cleaning up the financial sector. The European countries were deluding themselves about the state of their banks and we were very late in conducting serious stress tests and imposing recapitalisations. Certain countries, including France, even fought rearguard actions so as to avoid bolstering their large banks’ capital base. All of this has weighed on growth. We now need to make sure we don’t slip back again!   Christine Lagarde has announced that she will lead a review of the ECB’s strategy.  Christine Lagarde is right. It’s a good idea to step back and lead such a discussion. I hope that the debate will not be held solely within the ECB, but that independent economists and civil society representatives will be involved too.   If we look back on how the euro has fared since 1999, we can see that it did not produce all the effects that people had hoped for. Trade in the euro area is declining, the capital markets union is in limbo, countries with large capital surpluses, such as Germany or the Netherlands, are investing them in the United States or in China, etc. In fact, the country that is gaining the most from the euro is Germany, which amply benefits from the euro’s undervaluation.  Everyone benefits from the euro because the exchange rate risk has disappeared and financial conditions for investment have never been so favourable. Likewise, the euro is a common good that enables us to speak with one voice on the international scene, even if we don’t make enough use of this strength. But it is true that we created the euro, which was backed up with the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism, to enable a single European market, and the fact is that this market is at a standstill. Why? Because at the outset it was conceived as a space for the free movement of goods, whereas we are now in a service economy and there is no single market for services.   You cannot ignore the northern European countries’ refusal to offer financial solidarity.   We have a political problem: the European states have a single currency which, through its very existence, is an extraordinary expression of solidarity. But they tend to see the euro area too much as a club with free membership, giving them the right to a certain number of services. However, participation in the euro brings with it a duty of solidarity when your neighbour is going through a rough patch. While it’s true that the Member States fulfilled their duty towards Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain, they did so under conditions that were extremely costly, or even toxic, on a political level. The adjustment programmes generated huge tensions and acrimony. And, conversely, you need to keep your own house in order to avoid creating problems for your neighbours. Countries can have whatever economic policy they want, that’s democracy, but on the condition that they do not jeopardise their neighbours. To that end, the members of the club need to observe certain rules. In reality, however, countries have little regard for those rules. One day we will need to create ad hoc institutions, including an authority in charge of a euro area budget which would embody the collective interest, have decision-making powers and be accountable before the European Parliament. For as long as that is not in place, we will have to cross our fingers and hope that no crisis occurs.  So is the ECB making up for the failure of political will?  Yes. The lack of coordination in the fiscal domain means that we are the ones who are doing the work. I dream of a euro area with a strong and democratic political base, which would alleviate the burden on the ECB. . The politicisation of the ECB results from the weakness of the political pillar of Economic and Monetary Union. Some people accuse the ECB of doing too much and of not being democratic enough, but the excessive expectations projected onto the ECB are only a reflection of political weakness.   "

It's really appreciated. A special day; you've just had your first press conference as President of the ECB. Had you ever thought you would be President of a central bank?  No! Never, but I never thought I would be Managing Director of the IMF, and I never thought I would be Minister of Economy and Finance for France, so my life has been like that.  Have you already learned the lingo of the ECB?  I'm learning! I'm learning a little bit of German, I'm taking lessons and I'm constantly immersed in central banking jargon and concepts and attitude of mind, but I'm learning fast.  You made clear at the press conference that you have your own style.  Yes.  But can you be yourself in this role? Because every word you say as president of the ECB might instantly impact financial markets.  Well, first of all, I like words. I tend to be attentive to the words I use, so that suits me fine. And what I did during my press conference, the first one, I tried to warn the journalists in the room and the journalists and observers behind their screens that they have to take me for who I am and not try to second-guess or associate or proceed by an analogy, an analysis or comparative work because it would probably be misguided. And I think the trade-off for that is that when I have something to say, I will say it. That’s more my style and my nature.  Yes, you want to make that clear. You never led a central bank before. Do you think that's an advantage or a disadvantage?  Having been Minister of Finance for four years, in the middle of the financial crisis and having navigated the difficulty of that, having had to put in place a lot of regulations that still apply today to sanitise and strengthen the financial sector at the time, and having had the privilege of leading the International Monetary Fund for eight years, which is in many instances the lender of last resort to countries in difficulty, I know some of the facets of the work that is done here. I learn fast, I work hard and I'm surrounded by exceptionally competent people. So to the extent that I can sometimes challenge some of the conventional views and the sort of home-grown conventional wisdom, I think it's very healthy.  Yes, it could be an advantage.  It could be.  You are the first woman to lead the ECB, which used to be a man's world. How are people reacting?  I think they notice but I think they tolerate it and hopefully they will accept that I can do as good, if not a better job than men would. I think that's the beauty of diversity and the openness of this institution, actually, to accept, engage and respect differences and to try to include them.  Do you believe it's important that a woman is leading such a prominent institution like the ECB?  Yes, I do, because I see too many younger women – not necessarily younger women actually – but too many of my colleagues and friends and people that I meet in the course of everyday life, who look up to me and say to themselves or say sometimes to me, “About time that a woman does this job”, number 1. Number 2, “If she can do it, maybe I can do it, too – and if not me then my daughters maybe can do it.” So I think that as a signal it's important. It honestly gives me, I would say, additional responsibilities because I don't want to let them down. That puts an additional weight on my shoulders. I have to honour that.  Also the European Commission is led by a woman now. Do you think that will make a difference somehow?  I'm sure it will. When you look at some photos from the days when the European Union was set up in the first place, or when you look at old photos – sometimes not so old photos – of the ECB, of the Governing Council, it does make a difference, if only optically. But I also think that it brings an added dimension, which is the sheer dimension of diversity of thinking.  But also in policy.  Oh, I think everybody brings…  Maybe risk-taking?  On risk-taking, I think, it has been demonstrated empirically now by a lot of analytical work that has been done on the trade floor and in various circles, that the risk attitude is different. You see that by the sort of rotation of portfolios, for instance, and that has been studied extensively. I think we tend to have a different horizon and we embrace different priorities. And we have a different look at risk, yes.  That's a good development. Let's talk about the ECB and the Netherlands, because in the Netherlands there is a lot of criticism of ECB policy, especially the low interest rates. It's not good for people's savings, for our pension system. How do you see this criticism?  Well, first of all, I would like to say that I hear that criticism and I completely understand and appreciate the concern that some people have. If you're saving, if you are at risk of receiving less pension, obviously you are concerned and we should look at that. We should monitor it and we should appreciate what is happening – and we do. I can assure you that it was done in the past and it will certainly continue to be done, if not emphasised, going forward. But having said that, our job, which has been given by Europe and the euro area in particular in the Treaty, is to maintain price stability and to use tools that we can use in order to arrive at that. I think that what has been done by the ECB is to use as many tools as are available and can prove efficient in order to maintain that price stability which has been defined way back in 2003 as close to but below 2%. Until such time when we arrive at this aim that we have, we need to continue using the tools. Interest rates are one of them. When I look backward, since 2014, there has been a lot of good development. If I look at your country, for instance, in the Netherlands, where today you have about 9.3 million people at work, from those 9.3 about 800,000 jobs were created as a result of the monetary policy and other policies, fiscal and structural reforms. So it has been extremely useful to use those lower interest rate policies going forward; that's point number 1. Point number 2, I realise that it's difficult for the pension system, but it does not affect all pension systems in all euro area member states. So I think it's also how each pension scheme is calibrated, organised, structured that is in question and that needs to be looked at, because it affects one country, it doesn't affect others.   What I wanted to say is that even our President of the Dutch Central Bank is not happy with the ECB monetary policy, and is so unhappy that he addressed it in a public statement a couple of months ago. Do you understand his concerns?  I don't want to revisit the past because the past is where it is. I'm more concerned about what I can do and how I can help, and how we can be attentive to delivering on our mission in accordance with our mandate. Being attentive to all consequences on inflation, but on all other items as well, including the negative effects. Number 3, I would observe also that ever since I started on November 1, we have worked very cooperatively, very consensually, including with Governor Knot.  You've spoken with him about this?  Yes, absolutely, we've known each other for a long time and we are very, very close to each other. I know the problem that some of the Dutch people are concerned about, and I share their concern.  Yes, but…  Don't forget one thing: very often a saver is also the owner of his house. Houses have increased in value over the course of time.  Yes, but there is also a risk.  You can look at everything as a risk, everything as a benefit, and you're right; that the price of houses has gone up. It's less accessible to young people. Maybe more housing would help in the process. So while we have to set our policies at the euro area level, being attentive to each and every member state as well, there are measures that can be taken at the national level in order to address some of the negative effects.  Moody's concluded today that the Netherlands is at risk of a housing crisis. Is that something to worry about?  As I said, the housing prices have gone up in many large centres in some of the euro area member states, and measures can be taken in order to temper these price increases. I think it's nine out of 19 euro area countries that have already taken specific measures to temper prices, meaning reducing a little bit access to credit and providing conditionality so that there is not an excessive demand relative to supply. I also think that supply measures could be in order and that housing should be encouraged and developed whenever there is shortage and when supply cannot meet demand.  Which brings me to another question: is it even possible to have adequate monetary policy in the euro area when the differences between countries are so big? If we look at inflation for example, the last six months, in the Netherlands it was 2.6% while the European average was 1.4%. So is it possible?  It's the rule of the game. When the euro area was set up, when the euro was chosen, when we see that people support the euro and like the euro as much as they do, we have to find the tools and put in place the instruments to strengthen the euro area. Why are we short of banking union? Why are we short of capital markets union, so that if I have a small enterprise in France, I can actually borrow the funding that is available in the Netherlands and we can have a consistent and deeper system of financing our enterprises. These are tools that we have to use to bring more harmony, more consistency between the markets. It cannot be only about the monetary union. It has to go beyond that to be solid and to be more efficient.  Does the weak economy in Europe worry you?  Clearly, growth is not at potential and hopefully by 2022 – this is in our forecast – we will be close to potential, at 1.4% growth. We have to use all the tools. We will do what we have to do, but I think that some fiscal policies should be applied and I'm very pleased to see that the Netherlands are deploying fiscal policies in a very sensible and wise way in order to respond to the situation and to use the space that is available without even touching the special reserve fund that has been set up. But others should follow suit and should be inspired by the Dutch example.  About the Dutch budget surplus, as IMF Managing Director you always said that it would be good if the Dutch Government spent more. Do you think the same, as the ECB President?  This is happening because what I understand from the forecast for the next two years is that they will develop spending on education, on infrastructure, on fighting climate change. This is exactly what those countries that have fiscal space should do, and I think this is very, very welcome.  You still say the same, but our Minister of Finance…  No, I said that I admire what is being considered.  Yes, because our Minister of Finance, Wopke Hoekstra, was a bit irritated when you said that we have to spend more.  I completely understand that he was irritated. We discussed that when we met at the Eurogroup the other day, and he gave me full details of what the funds are and what the expenditures will be and what the spending will be. I think it is very sensible to do that, particularly to invest in the future productivity of the Dutch economy at large. I think it's great.  You said it just days before you started as ECB President.  So I was not yet committing the ECB.  So you understand his irritation?  I do. I always try to understand why people get irritated because then I can either explain my case and argue it, if I think that it is right. But if it is not right and if I stand to be contradicted, I fully understand that and I respect that.  You are getting along well now?  Yes, we do, absolutely!  Why should we spend more?  Because the world is changing, because we want to remain productive and competitive, because the very nasty development that we see on the horizon had to be addressed and for that, we need to spend money. We don't want climate change to damage our countries. We want our kids to be educated. We want artificial intelligence to be something that they play with on a regular basis. We want them to be stronger going forward. So to do that, investment is needed.  Investment in the Green Deal, because it's not only about economic growth these days.  No, it's sustainable growth and certainly the Green Deal is remarkable in that respect. The 50 measures that have been identified by Ursula von der Leyen are good ones, but each country, each member state has to sort of question its own public expenditure and ask itself: is that going to make a difference for climate change purposes? How should I change it, if not? I think that the Netherlands is clearly looking at those issues. Your country has always been very attentive to nature around it anyway.  You suggested that the ECB also has a responsibility when it comes to climate change; in what way? Your mandate is price stability, isn't it?  Correct, but to identify price stability, you need to assess risk, you need to forecast growth, you need to understand better where the economies are going. And if you don't factor this into the risk assessment and the forecast and the models that underline that, you don't take into account climate change. You're missing a big chunk of the risks that are looming on the horizon and that will be upon us much quicker than we think. So if only in respect of that work, we must take climate change into account. Added to that, when we invest, we have to be mindful as well and how we do that is being debated in our strategy review. Plus when we do supervision and when we look at how banks are valuing their liabilities and their assets, we need to ask them whether they take climate change risk into account as well. So there are multiple ramifications where we need to ask ourselves: do I need to change? Is climate change really part of my thinking? I will insist on that.  At this moment, the British people are voting. How important is the outcome for Europe?  I think the outcome that will close the loop of uncertainty that we have lived with for the last couple of years is very important. Business people and any economic actor, whether you're in a family or whether you're in enterprise, will tell you: “I need to know where I stand and what is the environment where I will invest, operate in? If we don't know, then we don't invest. Then we don't create jobs, then we don't trade”. And that's what has happened a little bit with the UK, because we didn't know and we still don't know to this day, what is the likely outcome. At the end of today we might know a little bit more. It won't be final because we still have probably a transition period which needs to be gone through, but at least some clarity will emerge out of tonight, I hope.  If Boris Johnson wins, Brexit will happen. What will be the effect on the European economy?  There will be negative consequences in the short term for all economies, predominantly the UK, and within the European Union some countries will be more at risk than others. Ireland is a case in point which will be sort of first affected. The Netherlands might be affected as well because it has a close relationship with the UK. Germany as well, the automotive industry. But clearly the major impact will be on the UK.  Mario Draghi will go into history as the man who saved the euro. What would you like your legacy to be?  I'm too young in the job to tell you!  Give us something…  I just hope that at the end of my term, the euro area and the euro system are even more relevant than they are today.  In what way?  More relevant in that it will serve the Europeans consistently and better. It will bring them more together and it will reinforce the unbelievable community that has been formed as a result of the European founding fathers of way back, and the euro area founders of a few years back.  Christine Lagarde, thank you so much for this interview.  Thank you.   "
2019-12-02,Luis de Guindos,Interview with El Mundo,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Pablo Rodríguez Suanzes on 25 November 2019","   INTERVIEW 2 December 2019  Interview with El Mundo   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Pablo Rodríguez Suanzes on 25 November 2019  How are you finding life in Frankfurt?   Frankfurt is a nice city, I like it. The ECB is the most important institution in the framework of the EU, and of the euro area in particular. Exposure to the public is very different to when you’re in government. Here, the relationship is mainly with the European Parliament, through hearings, and with the public, through speeches. Is my life better? It’s different.  How do you feel about not being able to speak as freely as before?  I can keep speaking normally. I still attend the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN); each week, we have discussions in various forums on issues around monetary and economic policy and financial stability. So I have something to offer, but my contributions aren’t political.  Do you miss it?  I don’t miss anything. That was my job for six years. I’m not at all bored here.  When and why did you decide you wanted to try to become the Vice-President of the ECB?  I wanted to leave the government at the end of its first term. I spoke to President Rajoy and we said it could be a possibility, and it was very attractive to me. It’s the most important institution in the euro area, very prestigious. It takes very significant decisions, which made it an extremely attractive proposition.  How do you explain the arrival of people like you or Christine Lagarde, who have a different profile to the one that ECB Executive Board members have traditionally had?  I don’t think anything was predetermined or premeditated. Members of the Governing Council have different profiles and each of them contributes according to their experience. I contribute my knowledge of the European economy and the financial system, and my experience taking decisions when the Spanish economy was at its most delicate moment.  What role does politics play in the ECB?  The 25 members of the Governing Council don’t always agree, although many of the decisions we take are unanimous. There are those who think that the situation requires further measures, and others who think we have already gone too far. We look for a consensus. The decisions are very democratic – one Governor, one vote – but actually taking a vote is an exception, not the rule.  In recent months there has been very strong, unprecedented public criticism.  I’m not at all concerned by the fact that there are differing views, that’s healthy and it’s normal because there are 25 of us. But what has been happening in recent months has not been very helpful. It hasn’t undermined the effectiveness of the September package of measures, because it went ahead as planned, but it’s much better to be united. We are a collegial institution and once we have reached an agreement, everyone should defend it. This is not to say, for example, that I agreed with every element of the package. But once something has been approved, I defend it.  Is the consensus broken?  No. This is actually one of the top priorities of the new President. Each of us will have our own ideas about the situation and the appropriate measures to take, that’s one thing, but it’s something else entirely to air disagreements in public.  You and Mr Draghi have met at various forums since 2011. How was the past year when you were working side by side?  Mario Draghi will go down in history as one of the founding fathers of the euro, even though he isn’t one in the strictest sense. There were two stages to his presidency. The first was saving the euro, with his famous “whatever it takes”. The second was fighting deflation. These were his two main interventions, and he was successful in both. He will be remembered very positively. When he uttered those famous words in London in 2012, he changed the outlook in the euro area. The banking union was implemented right away. Four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched, which brought the ECB in line with other central banks. Mario Draghi has modernised the instruments of monetary policy.  Despite this, his critics point to the fact that he has left behind a European economy that is “drugged”, with low growth, rates at zero and inflation very far from the objective.  Monetary policy is not the reason for this; it’s been the main driver of the economic recovery and growth in Europe. 11 million jobs have been created, in no small part thanks to monetary policy. This is the main thing, although there are collateral effects. The problem we have at the moment is that these monetary policy decisions need to be complemented by other instruments.  Sometimes it seemed like you were not exactly among Mr Draghi’s most ardent supporters.  I have always supported President Draghi.  But when you heard him being talked about as the saviour of the euro or the person who had rescued Spain, it didn’t sit well with you.  Well, he didn’t see it like that either. In Spain, we rescued ourselves, off our own backs, with the help of our European partners, including the ECB. Mr Draghi made a key contribution, but there’s no single saviour here. It was a set of circumstances and a matter of everyone carrying out their responsibilities in their individual roles.  As Vice-President will you continue to appear alongside President Lagarde?  I have no idea. I suppose it will continue like that. It’s an unwritten rule, a tradition. Traditions can change, but they can also be of value.  Brexit, trade and currency wars, geopolitical tensions. All of this in an environment of lower growth, zero rates and stimulus plans. When you were in government you joked that you slept like a baby, in that you woke up crying every two hours. How are you sleeping now?  Well. Very well! I wouldn’t wish what happened in 2012 on my worst enemy. The situation now is totally different; back then we were on the brink of collapse. The Spanish economy, the Italian economy, doubts about the integrity of the euro… the situation of the Spanish banking industry was terrifying and contagion was spreading to the Treasury. It was a dramatic situation. I don’t think there is going to be a recession in Europe, that’s very unlikely. But yes, I am worried that we will have two or three years of subdued growth, of below-potential growth. That is what is worrying me at the moment. And that this subdued growth may mean that the price stability objective is not met. Monetary policy is not the philosopher’s stone, it cannot be used to fix everything. Other policies are needed.  So do you echo the calls of Presidents Draghi and Lagarde for countries with fiscal space, above all Germany, to boost spending and investment?  This is important, yes, but my proposal goes further than that. Our current system of national fiscal policies and national budgets, with a set of rules like the Stability and Growth Pact, is not sufficient. We need a fiscal instrument of the sort proposed by President Macron a few years ago. An instrument that has the capacity to act countercyclically and that complements monetary policy.  But it’s something you were already asking for when you were a minister, and it’s not happening now, and even in the best of cases it won’t happen for another four or five years. And without that level of firepower…   We have to call for it because it is sensible. It is not a question of whether it is possible, but rather one of reality. It would be very important for the entire euro area and I am convinced that it will come about sooner rather than later.  What are your thoughts on the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy is doing well. It is competitive and enjoying above-average growth, and that is the result of the reforms in 2012 and 2013 and society’s efforts. It is doing well, that’s the truth. It has been affected by the economic slowdown, like the rest of the euro area, but growth is still at 2%. Why? The financial sector was cleaned up, and the economy is now competitive. Those are the two reasons why it is doing better.  Spain didn’t have any issues during the growth phase of the cycle. But now we are maybe seeing the effects of not having made any reforms in recent years, deferred budgets, or adjusted deficits during growth periods.   My recommendation is for the euro area as a whole, not just for Spain. If you have debt approaching 100% of GDP, you have to reduce it to be less vulnerable.   Are you worried by the political uncertainty?  Political uncertainty is an important factor because we always need stable governments capable of taking action. And this is of course quite obvious: we don’t have the political stability necessary to put into place the necessary measures and policies, including a budget.  What do they think here in Frankfurt about the fact that the budget has been deferred since the time when you were still a minister?  Spain has continued to reduce its public debt. It could have been reduced more, but it could also have been reduced less. In any case there is one fundamental factor: the growth differential. In the Spanish economy, this now comes from a financial sector that doesn’t have the same doubts hanging over it as it did five to seven years ago. And it is competitive. The most important thing, in contrast to the previous and other growth cycles, is that it is growing without an increase in loans and without a real estate bubble. With lending growth that is below nominal GDP and a current account surplus in the balance of payments. As long as these two things continue, the Spanish economy will keep growing faster than the rest. The recommendation, which is also valid for Portugal, Greece and Ireland, and even for Italy, is this: stabilise the banking sector and the credit markets. And maintain competitiveness. Then you will do better than average.   The public message is quite clear. Are there more discreet messages in private?  No, none. I say the same thing in public that I do in private.  Have the ECB’s non-standard measures run their course?  No. We can still increase bond purchases or lower interest rates further, which means that we still have the same tools available. What is happening is that the secondary effects are becoming more tangible .   And each measure has less of a return.  I look at the effects, and these can vary greatly. I am worried by risk taking in the asset management sector against the background of low interest rates. It is a matter of concern for me. Banks are now better capitalised, they have more liquidity, and they are much safer than they were. But they face low profitability, which is a problem. Supervision is centralised and is more suitable than when it was the remit of national authorities. But in the area of asset management and investment funds, what we see is that, in a low interest rate environment, their investment strategy always moves towards increased risk, in the sense of assets with potentially greater returns and greater risks but that are less liquid. And there is also more leveraging, not to the extent seen in the United States, but still more than before. And the supervision in this sector is not comparable with that in the banking sector. There is a risk. If they are asked for units to be paid out they have to do so within two or three days. I see a potential risk of liquidity imbalance. That is what worries me the most at the moment. And, while it may not technically be a secondary effect of monetary policy, because its causes are structural, I am concerned by the banking sector’s low profitability.   Are you in favour of changing or widening the ECB’s mandate? Or of defining more precisely what is below, but close to, 2%?  We have to look at that, yes. The ECB set out its strategy in 1998 and revised it in 2003 and, while it can’t be a change of mandate, since that is defined in the Treaty, we could revisit the definition of price stability. And what are the steps to achieve that? I am in favour of starting the discussion, but we haven’t had it. The President has announced it, but this is not a matter of one or two Governing Council meetings; it is something that must be done without haste, but decisively.  What about “helicopter money”, i.e. giving money directly to citizens?  No, that has never been considered.   But should it be considered, just like changing the mandate?  No, absolutely not.   There is a lot of talk currently about “Japanification”, about secular stagnation. Add to this demographics and the fact that there is a smaller working population with lower productivity than before. What scares you the most?  From a journalistic standpoint talking about Japanification is attractive, but there are actually many differences. While European demographics are not brilliant, they cannot be compared with Japan. The situation facing banks here is not as bad. No real estate bubble has burst here the way it did there. The parallels are in low inflation, low interest rates and low growth. But the outlooks are different and I don’t think that the term really applies to the European economy.  Will EDIS be complete when you leave office?  Yes, I think it will, and quite a few years before that, in fact.   One of the German proposals is to limit the amount of sovereign debt held by financial entities. Spain has experienced precisely that, with only national entities continuing to buy public debt at the same rate. Does that seem reasonable to you?  It’s a starting point. Completing EDIS is crucial. But we also have to take measures simultaneously to limit how much risk is generated by certain countries. In my experience with Banco Popular and the savings banks, the problem wasn’t public debt. The underlying problem was other types of loans that led to solvency problems.  Does the issue with Popular, Villarejo and BBVA bother you?   We do not comment on specific situations. Of course, European banking supervision and risk surveillance is on the lookout for anything that might have an effect on financial stability, but so far we have not seen anything.   "

Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Alessandro Marenzi, Sky TG24, with the participation of Federico Fubini, Corriere della Sera, and Franco Bruni, Bocconi University, broadcast on 23 November 2019  Alessandro Marenzi: Sette anni fa Draghi disse: faremo tutto quello che serve per preservare l’euro. [..] Dopo sette anni c’è ancora questo problema di preservare l’euro o non si pone nemmeno più la questione?  Philip Lane: What we have seen in the last seven years is a very long track record of a very stable currency. Remember what we have seen in these years: we've seen the interest rates in Europe very low, the spreads between governments much more narrow, and the inflation is controlled. So, yes, a very stable currency, and in the surveys the European population is increasingly happy with the euro as a currency.  Alessandro Marenzi: I tassi bassi o negativi si stanno sperimentando nel concreto. [..] Quanto durerà questa situazione e quali rischi ci sono in una situazione così paradossale per certi aspetti?  Philip Lane: Let me emphasise that the reason why the interest rates are so low is a very high level of saving but a low level of investment. Your question there is really: are we going to see high savings and low investment remain for a long time? We think at the ECB it depends very much on the policies of European governments. Policies that are pro-business, pro-investment will help to restore the interest rate [to a higher level]. Also a policy that encourages spending so that the savings rate comes down a little bit, that would also help. I would not exaggerate the role of the ECB. Behind the ECB is the deeper question of; why is investment in the European economy so low? Why is the saving rate in the European economy so high compared to investment?  Federico Fubini: [..] Pensa che ci sia un punto oltre il quale la politica dei tassi negativi finisca per ledere la percezione che una parte del pubblico europeo ha della Bce?  Philip Lane: I think it's important to emphasise that we recognise the dangers. For example, you give the example of negative rates on deposits, and this is why at the ECB in recent years, we take a multidimensional approach. We do have the negative rates, but we also have the asset purchase programme. We have targeted lending and we have forward guidance on interest rates, so we are trying to make sure that not all of the monetary policy operates through the negative rate. But we cannot rule it out. Of course, everyone agrees: at some level the negative rate will not be helpful. But our assessment is: we are not at that level now. If it is necessary to put the rate lower, we will be prepared to do so. It's a very important message and this goes back to the wider discussion.In any country, those who are a saver - every saver - would like to see a higher interest rate. But the answer to that is: let's get the European economy to invest more, because without more investment those savings have nowhere to go. The key to more investment is really good policies across the European Union: pro-innovation, pro-enterprise, pro-education. The key to a high return on investment is much more about those policies. It's a mistake to exaggerate the role of the ECB.  Franco Bruni: [..] Molti di noi pensano che sia il momento di ripensare con calma alla strategia della banca centrale nel perseguire il suo obiettivo statutario e fare una riflessione che metta insieme l’esperienza di questi anni e guardi al futuro tenendo conto anche di queste obiezioni sui tassi negativi, sull’eccesso di liquidità. Mi domando se c’è in programma di cominciare a pensare a una riflessione strategica.  Philip Lane: I think it's important to recognise that already the ECB has changed quite a bit, essentially from 2014 onwards. The ECB I think surprised many commentators by being so aggressive to tackle low inflation. The ECB has launched the sovereign bond programme. It has launched targeted lending, many innovations. Even this year, in the summertime we clarified that the inflation rate of 1.6 is too low, so the discussion now is much more precise. We do not find it acceptable to have inflation around 1.6. So 1.6 is not close to 2. That is important. We also emphasised in recent months that we view the inflation aim as symmetric. So we care just as much about inflation too low as inflation too high. Remember 20 years ago, the challenge was to convince everyone that we would keep inflation low. Now the challenge is to convince everyone that we will make sure inflation goes back to where we'd like it.I agree with you; many people agree that essentially the last major review was 2003. It is time to take stock, look at this experience and also recognise what element is unique to the ECB, and what is a global issue. As you know, the Fed in the US is in a review right now and many of the challenges are the same.  Alessandro Marenzi: [..] Molti sostengono che l’arsenale della Bce è vuoto, che non ci sono più molte altre munizionisoluzioni. È vero oppure sono troppo critici coloro che dicono che siamo sostanzialmente indifesi se arriva una nuova crisi?  Philip Lane: I think that is overly dramatic. I think everyone watching should be assured that, of course, as the ECB - as the controller of the euro currency - we have many ways to provide monetary accommodation. We all the time are examining our options, our instruments. But please remember: our ability to control the money supply is a very powerful weapon. Although, of course, we are in negative territory with negative rates, with all the programmes, the idea that monetary policy is at some limit: we don't see it. Our assessment, the work of our staff, believes that we have more room if we need it. Please remember, our forecast is that actually we will see an improvement in the next year or two. The scenarios where we need to have more dramatic policies, yes, if there is a severe negative shock, a big recession. But under the baseline, under the most likely scenario, we think the current policies are in good shape.   Alessandro Marenzi: Lei viene da un paese che anni fa ha avuto bisogno, l’Irlanda, qualche anno fa ha avuto bisogno di un salvataggio. [..] Si parla oggi molto del fondo salva stati, il Meccanismo europeo di stabilità, s che va riformato e c’è oggi un dibattito molto forte. Lo stesso Governatore della Banca centrale italiana ha detto: attenzione, perché se si fa questa riforma nel modo sbagliato ci sono rischi. Lei condivide queste le riserve o questii dubbi, espressi anche dal Governatore Visco, sul nuovo ruolo che avrà il Mes nella riforma di cui si discute?  Philip Lane: Let me emphasise that the understanding of the reform of the ESM and the very important issues about how sovereign debt will be treated, these are commonly understood. The concerns expressed by Governor Visco, everyone in the ECB, I think everyone across Europe understands this. My assessment is: the proposed reform of the ESM should not be viewed as too dramatic. Remember, right now no government in Europe faces a funding problem. The interest rates on all of the governments are quite low. There is no sign of any government having to go to the ESM and the whole point these days of the ESM is to reassure investors that if there were a problem, that we do have a European institution that will step in. I think that it's a very important debate, but I think everyone should feel comfortable with the proposed reform.  Federico Fubini: Mi verrebbe da chiedere a Philip Lane se ritiene che il principio di un coinvolgimento del settore privato nelle perdite che si è affermato con la direttiva BRRD nelle banche, sia un principio condivisibile e da tenere a mente e anche da mettere in pratica all’occorrenza in anche nel caso di crisi di paesi che dovessero rivolgersi al Mes per chiedere un aiutoel debito sovrano? [..] Lei ritiene che il Mesl’ESM debba fare un’analisi stringente della sostenibilità del debito con l’idea di imporre delle perdite anche degli obbligazionisti prima di mettere a disposizione il denaro degli altri paesi per sostenere un governo in crisi?  Philip Lane: I think the risk associated with this approach is well understood. But please remember: what is the alternative? To argue that under zero circumstances there can be a sovereign debt restructuring is not plausible. Please remember also: the foundation of the European Union, of the European Monetary Union, is that in extreme circumstances there cannot be a 100 percent guarantee on any sovereign. At the same time, please remember that this reform is in no way suggesting any level of automatic restructuring. Please remember that the ESM has representation from all member countries. I think in terms of logic, to rule out 100 percent, under all circumstances, debt sustainability analysis is just not plausible. [If that is necessary], it has to be the case that sovereign debt hasn't had that [high a] level of market discipline. But equally, I think everyone understands that this is really a very extreme situation.There can be many situations, I think, like we had in the Irish case, where the ESM money was available without any debt restructuring. We know there's a large grey zone, a zone where, if the ESM funding is available, the sovereign debt is fully sustainable. Really the question of restructuring is only - in respect actually – an extreme scenario.  Franco Bruni: Molti pensano che i paesi che hanno tendenza a fare troppio debitio non smpetteranno mai di farlo se i tassi di interesse sono sempre molto bassi, se la banca centrale continua a comprare i titoli e se anche le banche commerciali continuano a comprare titoli del proprio governo. [..] Se si tengono si compra tutto, se si tengono i tassi troppo bassi l’indisciplina prevale. Non pensa?  Philip Lane: Let me emphasise that what we see is that the credit spread remains and, as you say, if there is more risk of fiscal problems, the spread goes up. If there is a reassurance that a government will conform with European expectations, the spread comes down. Our assessment is: even though, of course, the Eurosystem is the big purchaser of sovereign debt, the market still understands that it is not a guarantee. Of course, today because of the inflation too low, we have this policy, but it's a policy about inflation. It's not a policy about the public finances. And so in the future, because we do expect inflation to recover and we do not expect that the super-low rate that we see today is necessarily forever, I think any government which is benefiting from the low interest rate today, as part of their fiscal strategy should be using this opportunity, in part to break the debt down in a gradual way. Let me reassure you that the ECB's policy is about inflation. It is not about providing an excuse to governments not to make sure their public finances are in good shape.  Alessandro Marenzi: [..] Il concetto di helicopter money, è una favola oppure è un meccanismo che si può studiare concretamente?  Philip Lane: I think it's a fascinating story to examine and I think it's interesting to discuss. But let me emphasise that it is not on the horizon -even to some people with some of those attractions that we don't think will be true to reality. So it remains the case that I think there are more headaches than solutions with that idea.   "
2019-11-20,Philip R. Lane,Q&A with Fortune ,"Q&A with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Maithreyi Seetharaman on 18 November 2019 at Fortune Global Forum","   INTERVIEW 20 November 2019  Q&A with Fortune     Q&A with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Maithreyi Seetharaman on 18 November 2019 at Fortune Global Forum    The following is a transcript of an on stage question and answer.    This is almost a time of new beginnings in Europe in many, many ways – especially as of 1 November – but it’s new beginnings for you as well. It’s been six months since you joined the ECB as its Chief Economist, and a big role change going from the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland to now looking at the eurozone as a whole. Here’s a curiosity question: the ECB had a retreat just a few days ago and it was in a very grand palace – probably grander than this – to build fences, get to know each other. What’s the new leadership of the European Central Bank looking like, with fresh blood like yours and Ms Lagarde’s?  I think the way to think about it is, the Governing Council meets all the time. The people in the Governing Council actually meet each other even more frequently through the IMF, ECOFIN, the Bank for International Settlements. But what is true is that the Governing Council has the six of us in Frankfurt and then the 19 Governors. When we spend time together in meetings, we’re busy. We have decisions to take, so what is true is that these years have been quite busy. In the four years I’ve been in the Governing Council, there’s not been the opportunity to have that kind of retreat. I’m sure every organisation here, you have these every so often, especially when there’s a new leadership. Let me emphasise: this year it’s not just the fact we’ve a new President or that I’ve arrived. Of the 25 members of the Governing Council, I think by the end of the year a majority will be new. And at the Executive Board there’ll be two new appointments, we think, starting in January, with Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel. So it is a time for a new team and it’s important, especially when we have so many medium-term challenges as well as the short-term day-to-day, meeting-by-meeting decisions, there are a lot of medium-term challenges over the next eight years for all of us. So it’s good to have that kind of retreat and that time to have some informal discussion.  I know a lot of people are curious about how maybe the structure and the operational side of decision-making at the European Central Bank could potentially change. I know there are a lot of voices – especially amongst the fresh blood that is coming in – of wanting it to look a little bit more like the Fed or like the Bank of England. Do you see that kind of openness coming into play when decision-making is made going forward? Do you see that playing a role in the way Europe looks at the European Central Bank?  There’s a lot in that question. Let me differentiate between the formalities of decision-making, where the tradition – I think it’s a very strong tradition – is, where we can, to make decisions by consensus. And actually, most of the time monetary policy is not that divisive. Most of the time I think we can achieve that. But what is true is, when you have different voices, new voices, how do you have a debate that adds light as opposed to noise? Because it’s not a good idea to have – in any system – signals which are hard to interpret. It’s very important for monetary policy that there’s a clear narrative, there’s a clear understanding of what we’re up to. And so I do think, collectively, it’s fine to elaborate where you have a different point of view. But we also have to emphasise that we also make decisions. So we’ve got a decision, and I think it’s important to say the most important element of that decision was achieved by consensus.  The most important element of the decision in September was: we need to add extra accommodation in our monetary policy, that inflation is too low and we need to demonstrate our commitment to having inflation move back towards its target sooner rather than later. After that, the details of which instruments we use, of course, with 25 members and…  You can’t really have consensus.   … many choices, there is going to be a range of views, but all of that is secondary to the fact that there was consensus that a monetary easing of some type was needed.  Well, let’s talk a little bit about where there is no consensus and there is no clarity – which would be Brexit – and that would be quite an interesting conversation to have. We’ve been talking about Brexit, the impact on the sterling. What is the position when it comes to the European Central Bank as we edge closer and closer to the UK elections, with not that much clarity still in place of whether we do a no deal, whether we get some sort of a deal that Mr Johnson’s kind of agreed to? What are the red flags for Ireland and for the eurozone at this point and what needs to happen for those red flags to become yellow or green?  Let me emphasise, from the euro area perspective, that in terms of planning we plan for all scenarios. As of now, because there is a draft deal, the worst-case scenario of a disorderly Brexit is less likely. But even if it did come back on the table, the ECB and the Bank of England have worked very closely together in the last two years. It’s not like this is a surprise; Brexit has been announced openly.  Ad nauseam.  Exactly, so it would be unforgiveable for the central banks not to be ready as far as we can be ready. So that kind of risk of discontinuities, something not working overnight – that is handled. But from the economic point of view, the big issues are going to be, what does this mean for future output, future trade – for the UK, most importantly. Remember, this is a disruption primarily for the UK. Of course, as a close neighbour, it’s important for the euro area, but percentage-wise less; the UK is 13%, some number like that, of EU GDP. So something that’s a big deal for the UK is a big deal for the rest of the euro area, but proportionally less.  Are you worried about Ireland at all and this back and forth which seems to have…  Of course, we are. The Irish economy is going to be the most affected, but this is the context of an Irish economy that is growing quite quickly, of an Irish economy which now has trade and investment links with the world - as you know - most famously with the US economy. One of the big pieces of news from the draft deal was the fact that there is now a sustainable approach, I think, to handling Northern Ireland in terms of the economics of reconciling no border on the island of Ireland, while maintaining the integrity of the EU single market.  I wanted to open this up to everyone in the audience because it’s rare to get an opportunity to speak to him directly, so Philip is here. If you have a question, please raise your hand. We’ll get the mics to you. Do let me know. Otherwise, I have plenty of questions to go on with. We’ll come back at some point to check in and see if the folks here do want to ask you a question. But it brings back a question of the number of risks. I know that there are risks within Europe of banks and banking profitability. There are trade wars. Brexit is one of those risks. When you look at the eurozone overall, if this was a pyramid, what are you going to put at the top of your worry list for 2020 and the next decade that is to come?  There are a lot of medium-term challenges. There’s a medium-term challenge for the world economy; as a very important part of the world economy – most importantly, China – is undergoing its own transition, undergoing a transition towards being focused on the domestic economy, focused on boosting consumption and services, then that transition has a mirror image. Because, of course, Europe benefited so much for many years from being able to be the supplier of capital goods, the supplier of so much to the Chinese economy. That’s an obvious structural transformation.  Another one is the climate change agenda: how is the world going to move along in terms of the carbon transition? Then also, and connected to those points: in terms of the mix of activity in the European economy, one thing the ECB has been highlighting is that, essentially, at this point after a very difficult period of rebuilding public finances, in terms of the support that could be provided by fiscal policy to a more balanced European economy, that this requires a big conversation among fiscal policymakers and, by extension, among the electorates about the role of fiscal policy in the European economy.   It has been said quite a bit by a number of central bank governors and within the ECB, there’s a limitation to what monetary policy can accomplish when you have slowing growth. What would you say are those limitations? Because at some point, QE has to end. Is there a plan for that? That’s not going to go on indefinitely, is it?  Let me rephrase that. Underneath everything, so whether it’s about very low interest rates, about low inflation, underneath everything is: how quickly is the European economy going to grow? Indeed, how quickly is the world economy going to grow? For that – many people here I’m sure have studied economics to some degree – monetary policy does not have long-run effects. And unless those long-run challenges about raising the growth rate, better policies about innovation, education, making sure there’s enough fiscal support for the level of aggregate demand are met …– monetary policy can take care of the cycle to an extent. But that cycle is around the trend, and the trend depends on these wider policies. For us, what we say is: if fiscal policy and structural policies delivered a faster growth rate for the economy then the monetary policy challenge would be a lot less. But I think also we would be emphatic that our monetary policies will accommodate for as long as necessary. But we think the recovery would be quicker if these other policies kicked in more strongly.  If they don’t kick in strongly, what tools are left in the chest?  Let me emphasise that what tools we pick out of the toolbox will depend on the particular circumstances we face. What we do emphasise is that our assessment is that it is not the case that we are at some kind of limit. In fact, the concept of monetary policy hitting an absolute limit – I think there’s a lot of nuance to that. But let me emphasise; we don’t think we’re at the limit as of yet. We do think the bigger focus should be, rather than on the distance of the central banking world to the limits, on the role that other policies can contribute to make this limit question less relevant, less interesting, because the economy will be growing more quickly.  You touched on something that I think resonates with everyone in this room, which is climate change. That is becoming part of the banking stress test here in Europe. When do you see climate issues being part of monetary policy for the European Central Bank? The remit is quite narrow at this point. What will it take, when do you see the time frame of it becoming part of that?  Lane: Let me answer that on different levels. First of all, it’s already part of monetary policy. When I’m trying to forecast the European economy for the next two years, the future of the car industry is a central issue. And, of course, the future of the car industry is deeply interconnected to where we’re going to be in terms of regulatory policy, carbon taxation, the preferences of consumers – many factors which are centrally driven by the carbon transition already are central to monetary policy. I think that’s only going in one direction. It’s very difficult to overstate, in the last two years, the speed at which the world’s central banks, both as monetary policymakers and as regulators, have invested in dealing with the carbon transition. The implications for monetary policy are quite straightforward. At one level, there are many opportunities. In fact, I was in various meetings in the last few weeks where the dominant driver of investment for many firms right now is adapting their firm to deal with the climate challenge. So at one level, it’s a driver of investment. At another level, uncertainty about: how quickly will carbon prices go up? What exactly will be the nature of regulatory restrictions to encourage the transition? That uncertainty is not helpful, so the more there are clear, comprehensive and vigorous climate change policies, I think the better for the transition.  Does anyone have a question for Philip? We do have one at the front. Please wait for the mic to come to you. Just your name and the company you represent, and a very quick question, please.   Audience member: I wanted to ask a similar question to the question that’s already been asked about interest rates. You will be aware, of course, that with the lowering of interest rates into negative interest rates it’s a real squeeze on interest rate margins for banks, to the point that many euro banks and non-euro banks are charging customers to be able to hold their deposits in euros. Banks are being charged to hold liquidity at the ECB. Now, I was also trained as an economist and in my lifetime, that was a very unusual experience to have to pay someone to hold money with them. I do not know if there is a nice way of asking, but I’d be really interested to know where you see the trend going over the next 12, 18 months. I actually think it’s unsustainable at its current trend.  I think it’s a fascinating question, which is very important that we put into context, so when we set monetary policy it’s for the whole economy. Now, banks are a central part of the transmission channel so we absolutely do care about how banks are adjusting to this. But let’s start at the most basic issue. Underneath our interest rate policy decision is, again, many people here will be familiar with the concept of the real interest rate, the inflation-adjusted rate, which is determined by the intersection of savings and investment. When you think at a global perspective or a European perspective, the driver of why interest rates are so low is a mix of low investment activity and a high preference for savings because of demographics – and also, by the way, risk aversion. There is also a high preference of finding so-called “safe assets”. And so the challenge for us is: many estimates of this real interest rate are close to zero or negative, either globally or for the European economy. Essentially, what that means is, if we raised rates above the level consistent with that real rate, that would be contractionary for the European economy. So we have this paradox of: it’s unprecedented, but it’s also the case – and the inflation numbers tell you – it’s not particularly a super loose policy. If it was super loose inflation would be higher. And this is the big question for the financial sector. The first point I would make is, our forecasts do say there will be recovery. We do say, even though inflation is around 1 now, we assess by 2021 it’ll be 1.5 which would be closer towards the target. The money markets do anticipate there will be some reversal in the interest rate path, so I think that’s a good baseline. On the other hand, I do think everyone here involved in the financial sector – and more generally those involved in government policy for pensions, insurance – have to recognise, how do we live in a world where sometimes it’s going to be the case the policy rate we set will go negative?  I think there is an adaptation of expectations. We are seeing, it’s very interesting in the banking world, right now about a quarter of European deposits to corporates are being charged at a negative rate. What’s interesting, we see, is, those corporates who were charged a negative rate, rather than suffer that, they’re doing more capex. Our transmission is supported, so it’s a nuanced view. As you know, we brought in tiering to compensate banks who are sitting on a lot of excess liquidity.  In terms of transmission, we also think up to now banks have benefited from a better macro picture, which means volumes are up even though margins are down. Also, credit risk is down, so there’s been less provisioning, less concern about credit risk. That isn’t to say those forces will be forever, so we absolutely accept this is something we’ll look at all the time. It’s an ongoing question.  I cannot think of a better question to end that interview on, and a better answer to give us a snapshot of what’s happening in Europe. Philip, thank you so much.    "
2019-11-20,Philip R. Lane,Interview with La Repubblica,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni on 14 November 2019","   INTERVIEW 20 November 2019  Interview with La Repubblica   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni on 14 November 2019  Christine Lagarde takes office as President of the ECB at a difficult moment. The Governing Council is split about the decisions taken in September.   I wouldn’t agree with your description! Of course, the September decision did have pros and cons, and it was not unanimous. But now we are two months on. That decision is made and we are moving forwards. Moreover, at Governing Council level this year there are many new members. It’s natural, with a new composition, to have discussions about how we operate as a group.  How’s the economic situation in the eurozone? Despite fears it could slip into recession, Germany’s growth has slightly ticked up.   In Germany, even though manufacturing is taking a hit, the wider economy, the consumption-driven part of it, is still in good shape. For the euro area as a whole, remember that manufacturing only represents about 17% of GDP. It’s more important in Germany and in Italy than it is in the wider European economy, but in the end it’s only a limited fraction of overall activity. We can have a lot of bad news about manufacturing, but it may still be dominated by good news coming from services and consumption.  So do you think that the ECB’s very accommodative September package is still justified?  There’s no doubt that, compared with 2017, there’s been a sustained slowdown, but in the euro area we don’t see a recession. The bigger issue is that the European economy has been growing more slowly than we hoped. It’s a disappointing performance, but not a negative one. We expect that there will be forces that help the recovery over the next year or two, including our monetary policy, which is going to contribute because it is leading to lower lending rates to firms and households. Our baseline scenario is a recovery in economic performance, but we have been consistent in highlighting that there’s also downside risk.   The OECD said recently that Donald Trump’s erratic trade wars might be the main reason for the global downturn, because they discourage investments.  It’s a significant factor that has been here for nearly two years. But the question now is: is it getting worse? In recent weeks, compared with the worst-case scenario, there’s been some optimism on the US-China trade relationship. That said, there remains a long-term discussion to be had about whether the world will restore its commitment to a global trading system, or whether, over time, we will see a bigger set of barriers that limit global trade.  How could a hard Brexit affect the eurozone’s fragile economy?  A deal has been agreed between the UK Government and the European Union, which of course will be tested in the next election. The worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit in the short term has been eliminated and the uncertainty over it is fading. But even under the deal there is going to be a more challenging economic relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU27. That is regrettable and it’s damaging, although – as the United Kingdom is a mid-sized economy – more of the damage will be in the United Kingdom than in the EU27.  There is a big discussion about the risk of a secular stagnation in Europe. You rule out a recession in the short term, but do you see this risk of a “Japanese scenario” in the long term?  The bigger issue with secular stagnation is not that Europe would have soon a recession; it’s that Europe and the wider world might grow at a very slow pace. It remains a relevant discussion because the big question is: are we going to grow at a low rate of maybe 1% a year? Or are we going to see a better performance than that? A lot depends on that in terms of living standards. One way to look at the issue – and I think this is very important – is that governments have a lot of opportunities in this environment because the decisions they make in terms of their policies towards business, their policies towards education, their policies towards employment, all of this matters very much. Essentially, if the policy choices by governments are more favourable to economic performance, then some of this stagnation fear may fade.   Do you mean countries that have a fiscal margin to use investments to boost growth, like Germany, should act?  That’s one element, but the other element which is for everyone, all countries – for Germany, for Italy, for every country – is that there are many non-financial policies that matter. It’s too narrow just to say let’s look at the budget deficit. We know that sometimes some of these policies take years to pay off. A country’s attitude to education, to the business environment, a country’s legal system, its labour market, the way it addresses an ageing population; these are all difficult issues, there are no easy answers. But that’s really where a lot more attention should be paid.  There are two very recent cases that seem perfect examples of what you were just saying about the best framework to do business. One is the surprising announcement by Elon Musk that he will build Tesla’s European Gigafactory in Germany. The Italian example of Arcelor-Mittal abandoning Ilva seems the very opposite case. You have legal uncertainty, a law that has changed from one government to the other. What do these examples say about “doing business” in Germany and Italy?  It’s not for a central banker to declare which particular policies should be adopted, but I think it’s important that all countries can learn from each other. This is one of the potential gains from being a member of the European Union. We have seen many examples where, in a given country, there might have been an intense debate about a particular policy. But then a number of years later we see that a country which adopted a particular policy is succeeding. Take Spain, for example, which has been growing very, very well. I think there’s a strong consensus that some of the policies they adopted in terms of reforming, for example, the labour market, have helped that. It’s important to remain optimistic that policies can make a difference. It is not the case that we are in a fatalistic situation where nothing can be done. Political leaders can make decisions that can improve the performance of their economies.   And many reforms don’t cost anything.   Yes, there might be good policies that do not cost anything. It’s not only about fiscal policy. And when there is an upfront cost, the European fiscal framework recognises that. It’s part of the way the fiscal policy is assessed. If you have a reform that may involve some upfront costs, that can be taken into account in calculating the fiscal space.  Going back to the secular stagnation, this scenario would also be very difficult for the ECB because it would condemn it to long-term accommodative policies. And recently Olivier Blanchard said that “monetary policy is almost out of ammunition, but if the central banks say it too explicitly, the markets may freak out.” Is that true?  We all have to recognise that the situation we face now is very different from the normal central banking experience 15 or 25 years ago. This has led to the famous question: is this the new normal? I think this discussion will continue for as long as a very substantial amount of monetary accommodation is needed, as you say. There will be a lot of discussion about where exactly the limit is. But our assessment here at the ECB is that we’re not at the limit and that if more is needed, we can do more. We’ve learned a lot in the last five years. Since 2014 the ECB has been exploring ways to provide monetary stimulus even though the policy rate turned negative in 2014. And our assessment is that our measures have been very successful. But I would also agree with your basic question: if the overall economic performance was stronger, then indeed the situation would be less difficult. We’ve talked about the role of reforms that can boost the growth rate. But we also say, as you know, that those countries which have fiscal space, especially if they are facing a slowdown, can do more to raise demand through fiscal policies as well.  The inflation target of the ECB hasn’t been reached for a long time. And it won’t be reached for years. So there is ongoing discussion about whether it would be better to change the target. Do you agree?  No matter what the exact definition of the target is, the current inflation rate of around 1% is unsatisfactory. The discussion about how exactly to define the target is more relevant the closer you get to it. When we’re sufficiently far away, we need to make sure we are providing the necessary monetary stimulus to help inflation increase over time. That is actually our forecast. We do not expect the current inflation rate to remain where it is. We do expect that all the stimulus we are providing will help inflation to move up over time. We now see it in wage inflation, which at the euro area level is now in line with our projections. What remains is converting the wage inflation into price inflation. Our projections say that this will happen in the next couple of years.  Coming back to a country like Italy: it has been growing very slowly for a very long time now, 20 years. How do you think it can grow faster?  When the discussion is about how to improve long-term economic performance over a longer time period, over ten or twenty years, the primary focus should not be on monetary policy but on other policies. Monetary policy is very important, but tends to have a temporary effect. The exact formula for Italy can really only be worked out by a discussion at the expert and political level in Italy. But the fact that the ECB has provided so much monetary accommodation provides a good environment for reforms. The conditions are now very favourable to implement policies to foster growth, in any country.   Many Germans say this accommodative stance has been a moral hazard for countries like Italy that haven’t made the necessary reforms. Some are even accusing the former Italian President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, of helping Italy with low interest rates and the government bond buying programme, exploiting German savers.  Let me first of all stress an important point. All of our discussions in the Governing Council are about the aggregate euro area, not about individual countries. Essentially, when we look at the inflation rate, when we look at unemployment, when we look at investment, all we look at is the overall picture. The Governing Council makes the decision collectively, so the nationality of the President is not a factor in how the policy is made. At the European level, concerns about moral hazard are addressed via the EU fiscal framework. It’s the responsibility of the European Commission and the European Council to monitor and discipline Members States, not that of the ECB. And that’s appropriate, because fiscal policy is a political competence. It is not for the ECB to be involved in that. What we do say is that all countries are benefiting from favourable financing conditions. We do think that the low interest rate environment provides an opportunity for those countries which need to reduce their debt ratios – and that’s many countries. These countries should use the interest rate windfall to reduce their debt ratios rather than be tempted to spend all of the windfall on new expenditures or tax cuts.   But how do you respond to the accusations that your monetary policy is exploiting German savers?  There are many savers in Germany, but there are also many savers elsewhere. Italy has a high savings rate, so there are many households in Italy that are in the same situation of receiving a lower interest rate on their savings. That’s true in every country. Some households, typically older and richer households, are savers. Other households, because they’re at a different point in their life, or their individual circumstances are different, are debtors. Roughly speaking, about 30% of European households are in debt, so their attitude to low interest rates would be quite different from someone who’s fortunate enough to have a significant amount of savings.   Do you think that this accommodative monetary policy fuelled right-wing populism in northern European countries? As you know, the former German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, accused the ECB of having strengthened the AFD.  I think this discussion has to evolve over time. The ECB or any other central bank has to recognise what the market forces are delivering. The big, difficult discussion is: how do governments respond to that in terms of their reform policies, in terms of their fiscal policies? Essentially, if the world economy is growing slowly, if there is not sufficient support from fiscal policy, if the reform policies are not sufficiently ambitious, then the policy choices for the ECB or any other central bank are going to be quite limited.  On the other hand, right-wing populists in southern European countries, the Italian Lega for example, often blame the euro for the weak growth of the last decades. How dangerous are those discussions for the future of the common currency?  It’s an important debate and it’s an evolving one. Recent Eurobarometer surveys show a significant improvement in the attitude of individuals towards the euro. Some of the worst of this is fading. One has to remember that the euro remains a very young currency; it’s only 20 years old this year. We should all recognise how important it has been to reform the institutional architecture of the euro area, particularly in the last years. It’s a massive regret that some of the reforms that are now in place had not been implemented in advance of the crisis. The crisis could have been managed better if we had already put the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the banking union and so on in place earlier. Thanks to these reforms, we now have a lot more stability, which has helped the euro area to perform better. But other important factors have had a role in influencing the debate around the euro.   Which ones?  In the last 25 years a number of developments overlapped with the introduction of the euro. We’ve had major changes in the world economy, which have been especially challenging for some European countries because of the rise of competition from the emerging economies. We have also had the IT revolution, and the ageing of the European population, which has a long-term effect on how the European economy operates. I think it’s an interpretation error, a fallacy, to say all of the problems we have had are due to the euro. I’m pretty sure the euro has had a much less important contribution than these wider forces. Then we could also consider that one of the major reasons why Europe performed quite well in the 1990s was the success of moving forwards with the Single Market. Building a single market across the European Union provided new opportunities. That’s now been pretty stagnant for a long time. A renewed emphasis on building the Single Market would provide new opportunities for firms across Europe, including Italian firms. Coming back to what many people ask: where can the euro be helpful? I think the single currency can help sustain renewed efforts in completing the Single Market in goods and services.  There is very strong rhetoric in Germany about always being a creditor towards other countries. Isn’t it also true that no other country gains so much out of a currency that is far too weak compared with its economy and boosts its exports?  I don’t think it’s useful to put a label on any country, saying “this country wins, that country loses.” We absolutely have to recognise that all of the ESM debt has been paid back. At the same time, the risk of bearing losses was there. In other words, the ESM was a very important act of solidarity, a sign that the member countries stand with each other if needed.  It’s reasonable and important to recognise that solidarity is there and it involves the willingness to bear that risk. The fact that the stronger countries stood behind the more vulnerable countries was an important and risky move. It has been successful. If we look at international trade, definitely, the last 25 years have been a period when, by and large, the exporting countries have gained. Germany, but also Italy, have benefited from the euro being a major stable global currency. But let me emphasise right now: in the last year the exporting countries are of course those that are suffering the most from the global slowdown. It doesn’t always go in one direction.  The third pillar of the banking union, the common deposit scheme, is still missing, but the German Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, has now proposed completing it, but still with some caveats that led the Italian Finance Minister to reject the proposal. Roberto Gualtieri warned that the German proposal would harm the competitiveness of European banks. What do you think about this?  I think that there’s room for negotiation. There are valid concerns in the German paper, but equally it’s not framed with red lines.  Are you sure?  Well, I don’t read it as a set of red lines; I read it as a set of important issues where there is room for negotiation. My view is that there is a middle course, there is a way to reconcile these different concerns. Risks have come down. The non-performing loan ratios have come down. There’s more and more evidence of stability in Europe, and the conditions now are much more favourable to a negotiation than several years ago, when the amount of concern about risk was much greater.  One of the critical points for some countries seems to be the German request to limit the exposure of the banks to government debt.  Right, but I think that banks in the euro area can diversify their sovereign bond holdings without taking on currency risk. They already do, to an extent. The question is: what is a reasonable level of diversification? All countries should be confident that, by and large, while their own banks may hold less of their domestic debt, this should be offset by new sources of demand for the home sovereign debt from the other countries. If the banks across the euro area are essentially holding the debts of all countries in a risk-adjusted way, then in net terms there may be very little difference for the debt issuers. Their debts are just differently shared.  In Germany and outside there is a huge discussion about the “schwarze Null”. There are some economists and politicians that even think that the government should change the constitution, and the famous debt brake of 0.35%, to give it more margin to act when the economy goes bad. Do you agree?  The issue is more general, because Germany is not the only low-debt country. In general terms, it’s an interesting economic question. I think these debt brakes can play a useful role when you’re trying to move from being in a high debt situation to a safe level of debt. Once you’ve achieved that, the question is: what is a reasonable framework? Once you’re in the safe zone I think that fiscal policy can be conducted differently.  Germany is there now, its debt is around 60%.  All countries know that there can be many pressures on public spending in the years ahead, basically because of the ageing of the population, the rising costs of healthcare and, of course, there’s going to be significant pressure on the public finances from what is necessary to tackle climate change. However, in a world where interest rates are so low, I think it’s perfectly possible to reconcile the fact that you need to make sure that your long-term fiscal goals are achieved with the fact that the business cycle is also affected by fiscal policy. And probably this can’t be summarised in a single rule. Historically, this was not especially relevant because the fiscal multipliers have traditionally been low. Essentially, central banks would offset fiscal stimulus if it was proven to be inflationary. But in a world of low inflation and low interest rates, we think fiscal multipliers under the current conditions are quite high if you have the fiscal space. I think we should be confident that there isn’t really a kind of excessive trade-off between being stimulating in the short term, while still making sure that we’re sufficiently prudent that long-term goals can be achieved. I think that a gear shift is required. For a long time the overwhelming focus was on how to make sure the high debt levels came down. But at some point that gear shift has to happen for those countries which have been successful.  In Italy there is a heavy brain drain, many young people go abroad. This poses a problem for the future of the country as well. And many highly qualified young people choose France or Sweden or Germany because they earn much more. Should Italian companies raise salaries?  One of the great achievements of the European Union has been free movement of people – the freedom to move across borders. At an individual level, of course that’s a fantastic gain from being a member of the European Union. But it can also be a difficult choice to make for the individuals concerned, as people by and large would like to live in their home country. Governments should recognise that if opportunities are greater abroad, many will take that decision. However, if wages are not backed by productivity, they should not go up. The way I would phrase it is: countries need to make sure that their economy is sufficiently productive to sustain the high wages that would make sure they not only attract their local workers, but they are also a hub for workers from across the rest of the EU.

2019-11-12,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Börsen-Zeitung,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Mark Schrörs and Detlef Fechtner on 5 November 2019 and published on 12 November","   INTERVIEW  Interview with Börsen-Zeitung   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Mark Schrörs and Detlef Fechtner on 5 November 2019 and published on 12 November  Mr de Guindos, how did you find your first days with the new President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, who succeeded Mario Draghi at the start of November?  They were great! We held some initial meetings and discussions which went really well for President Lagarde and for us. Our first Governing Council meeting chaired by her takes place this week.  You sound very enthusiastic.  President Lagarde has vast experience and knows exactly which topics are the most crucial. She will undoubtedly be an excellent ECB President.  The ECB President is new, but the same cannot be said for the economic environment, which inspires less enthusiasm. How worried are you about the euro area economy?   For two years now, we have seen a persistent weakening of the economy and a slowdown in growth. In the third and fourth quarters, however, we now observe a stabilisation. A recession in the euro area is highly unlikely. The real threat at present is an extended phase of extremely low growth, below potential.  Does that mean you are basically more optimistic than you were recently? Has this anything to do with the rapprochement between the United States and China in the trade dispute and the recent postponement of the Brexit deadline?  The news reports are more encouraging than they were two or three months ago. A no-deal Brexit is off the table for now. There is some hope of an initial partial agreement in the US-China trade dispute, which at least suggests that it will not escalate any further. Averting escalation would be good news in itself.  So have the risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook abated?  Let me put it this way: the risks are now slightly less tilted to the downside than they were before.  And how do you view the outlook for inflation? Have the risks decreased in that regard too?   The latest development is precisely in line with our expectations. We expected that inflation would fall clearly below 1% in September and October. Inflation was 0.7% in October but is probably hovering around 1% at the moment. The same applies to core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. The big question is why the current wage increases are not pushing up inflation.  And what is your answer?   There are many possible explanations: the low growth rate, the aftermath of the debt crisis or the fact that many firms are now evidently focusing less on maximising their returns and more on maintaining or expanding their market share. Central banks worldwide are dealing with these same phenomena.   Given the recent improvement in the euro area economy, do you think that the accommodative September package, including the restart of bond purchases (Quantitative Easing, QE) is still appropriate – or was it an overreaction, as some critical members of the ECB’s Governing Council have said openly?  Adopting the September policy package was, and remains, the absolutely right decision. As mentioned, the risk of a recession is very low. But there is another danger, namely that growth remains extremely low, at levels far below the potential growth rate, for years to come. An environment of low growth and low inflation could de-anchor inflation expectations…  … and so move them lastingly away from the ECB’s inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%.  Inflation expectations have recently shown a marked decline but they have not yet become de-anchored. That could change, however, as occurred in 2015 when there was a real risk of deflation. That is why we adopted the September package.   But with interest rates already at such low levels, more and more economists, and even some central bankers, harbour doubts that further loosening will have a significant positive impact on the real economy.   Our models show that the package will have a noticeable positive effect on growth and on inflation over the next two years. By the way, the most important component of the package is forward guidance. It is the core element and the message is clear: interest rates will remain lower for longer. And if the inflation outlook should not converge to our aim, we will take appropriate action in future, too, and – if necessary – adopt new measures.   Former central bankers such as ex-ECB chief economists Otmar Issing and Jürgen Stark recently issued a memorandum criticising the ECB for sticking too rigidly to a “point target”of close to 2% and not paying enough heed to the negative side effects of its ultra-loose monetary policy.   Monetary policy always has side effects. We are highly aware of them; we meticulously observe the side effects of our measures and factor them into our decisions. That is why we have now introduced a two-tier system for reserve remuneration so as to mitigate the adverse impact of the negative deposit rates on banks.   The two-tier system will make banks partially exempt from the negative deposit rates and should help first and foremost to boost their profitability. But there are many more negative side effects: the possible build-up of new financial surpluses, the misallocation of resources, a “zombification” of the economy. Many experts already think that the euro area is heading towards a “Japanification”, with a prolonged period of low growth and low inflation and with no end in sight to the ultra-loose monetary policy.   As I said, we are well aware of the side effects of our monetary policy and we will hold the side effects up to even closer scrutiny in future and pay them even more attention. As for a possible “Japanification”, I don’t see any such danger. The situation in the euro area is completely different to that in Japan. We have no real estate bubble in the euro area and the banks have a much stronger capital position. Fiscal policy has far more leeway and, even if demographic developments in the euro area are not good either, they are still far better than those in Japan. While it may be tempting to draw parallels, the euro area is not Japan.  You mentioned the state of the banking sector. Is it really that good? Judging by equity prices, investors do not seem convinced.   Speaking of the negative side effects of persistently low interest rates on financial stability, I see two main risks at the moment, one of them being the area of asset management. Regulators and supervisors need to keep a closer eye on this sector and take action if necessary. And the other main risk is low bank profitability. That is a reality. The European banks’ return on equity is far below the level demanded by investors, resulting in extremely low market valuations. This may have far-reaching consequences.   Specifically?  It is very difficult for banks to raise fresh capital and this can stand in the way of the urgently needed further consolidation in the sector. Moreover, prolonged low profitability can erode the banks’ capital base. We are fully aware of that.  So has the time come to say goodbye to zero and negative interest rates?   No, because we need them for monetary policy reasons. Low bank profitability can mainly be attributed to structural factors such as excessive costs and overcapacity in the sector. Compared with these factors, low interest rates have only a marginal impact. Banks should not seek to deflect attention from their actual problems by criticising the low interest rates. They would do better to channel all their effort into adapting to the new situation, lowering their costs and eliminating overcapacity.  Do you see a risk of a credit crunch or a risk that the banks might amplify a downturn through procyclical lending?  We neither see a credit crunch nor expect one. Banks have much more capital available than they did before. Their liquidity position is strong. Banks are more resilient than they were a few years ago. But, as I said, that is no reason to relax.   The ECB and others are also calling on fiscal policymakers to make more of an effort. A more active fiscal policy should support the economy and thereby help monetary policy too. The spotlight is also on Germany as a country that should invest more.   Some countries such as Germany and the Netherlands have fiscal space and they should make more use of this leeway in the current environment. But something that is more important than exerting pressure on individual countries is this: we need to rethink the fiscal rules and the fiscal framework in the euro area. The current set-up with 19 national fiscal policies and the Stability and Growth Pact is suboptimal. We urgently need a centralised budgetary instrument in order to pursue a common anticyclical fiscal policy. That could also take some of the pressure off national budgets.   But there doesn’t seem to be much political will for this at the moment, does there? The planned euro area budget is small and is intended to be used primarily to support economic convergence.  The question of political will is a different matter. What is clear, however, is that, in an environment of low interest rates and a lower equilibrium interest rate, monetary policy will reach the lower bound for rates more often in future. At the same time, the negative side effects of accommodative monetary policy are becoming increasingly evident. So fiscal policy will need to play a much stronger role in future.  Has the ECB exhausted all its options with monetary policy?  No!  Well, that’s very definite.  Yes, it’s definite. If necessary, we could cut interest rates further. We could increase the volumes in our asset purchase programme. We could further improve the conditions for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the TLTROs. We have definitely not exhausted all our options. We have scope to take further action, and we will take further action should it become necessary. But it’s also clear, as I said, that the negative side effects are becoming ever more pronounced. What’s more, in the current environment, with interest rates very low for longer, fiscal policy would have a much bigger impact on the economy than would otherwise be the case.  In an emergency, would helicopter money be an option for the ECB, meaning that the central bank would give money to euro area citizens?  Helicopter money is not something we are considering. But there’s something else I’d like to make clear. We just decided on a package of measures in September. That’s not something you can do every month or two. We shouldn’t undermine the package now by speculating about possible next steps. The package is appropriate and we believe that it will be effective.  Criticism of the package was particularly loud in Germany – just as it has been of the ECB’s actions more generally over the past few years. Can Christine Lagarde as ECB President repair the relationship with Germany?  Germany is of course very important for the ECB. Germany is the biggest country in the euro area, and the biggest economy. We need to pay attention to what is happening in Germany and to the public mood. I’m sure that President Lagarde will manage to build up a good relationship.  She has already said that she wants to review the ECB’s strategy. What does that mean in concrete terms, and what would you consider to be the priorities?  It will certainly cover various aspects. One aspect is price stability – what price stability means and how we define it. It will also cover the symmetry of our aim. Our reaction function is another aspect – in other words, how we react when we don’t meet our objective. I’m sure the discussion will be a lengthy process. It’s not something that can be decided in one or two Governing Council meetings.  Will it be an extensive undertaking like it was last time, back in 2002-03?  We will certainly be gathering a great deal of information and input. Just look at what the Federal Reserve is doing. It started reviewing its strategy six months ago and won’t be finished until early 2020. In our case, I’m sure there will be different views about certain aspects, but I hope that we will be able to agree on a common position in the end.  Will there be greater clarity in the future about what the medium-term inflation aim of “below, but close to, 2%” means? Some Governing Council members seem to think that levels of 1.5% or less would be acceptable, while others wouldn’t go much below 1.9%.  You’ll have to be patient, we haven’t even really started discussing it. But I’d like to make another point here. The big question at the moment has to be why it is proving difficult to raise inflation. But there’s no question that the unconventional monetary policy measures have been successful. When we started taking those measures, there was a risk of deflation. That dangerous situation has been averted; there’s no longer a risk of deflation.  Does the fact that inflation is low worldwide suggest that the aim should be lower?  I don’t see any convincing reason to lower our aim. It’s also important not to confuse what’s happening now with what the medium-term aim should be.  But are you of the view that the ECB’s inflation aim is symmetric? Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said recently that the current formulation of the objective is not symmetric.  There has always been symmetry in the implementation of our monetary policy – we have always acted decisively whenever inflation has shown signs of deviating from our medium-term aim. And it doesn’t matter whether it is too high or too low – we act with the same decisiveness.  Does that also mean that after years of inflation being below the objective, rates will need to be above the level of below, but close to, 2% for a longer period?  That will be part of our discussion of the strategy.  There are also discussions about the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy. Some people, including renowned experts, have been saying that the strict separation and the independence of central banks was the right approach when inflation needed to be dampened, but that more cooperation or even coordination is needed when inflation is too low. What is your view?  Monetary and fiscal policy are of course related and interact with one another. But that mustn’t affect the independence of the ECB in any way. We must be absolutely independent in our decision-making. But we do look at what is happening around us. How is the global economy doing? What is happening in Europe? What are the financial markets doing? And we also look at the fiscal policy stance. We need to look at all of these things.   Do you think that in this respect it might even be helpful that you, like Christine Lagarde, have experience as a minister? Some critics have bemoaned the lack of economic expertise and central bank experience.  We see ourselves as a college – we each bring different experiences and backgrounds to the Executive Board and the Governing Council of the ECB. I myself was Spanish Finance Minister during the worst phase of the sovereign debt crisis. I’m an economist and I know what problems the banking system can create for an economy. I know what the consequences are when a credit and housing market bubble bursts. I know that we need to complete banking union and that we need a capital markets union. I know that we need a central fiscal capacity in the euro area. Each one of us brings our perspective and our experience to the table, and that enriches the decision-making process.   On the subject of banking union, the German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has now proposed a compromise solution for a common European deposit insurance scheme. What do you think of the proposal? Will it help to break the deadlock surrounding this topic?  This is a positive development, an important step forward on this debate. The ECB has always firmly emphasised the need to complete the banking union – where a European deposit insurance scheme is a key missing element. We need to make sure that a €1 deposit is just as safe, and just as valuable, wherever you are in the euro area. This would enhance confidence in our banking system. And that’s key to support the bank-based transmission of our monetary policy, essential for a solid and effective economic and monetary union.  The ECB used to conduct its work in the background, but in recent years it has edged ever further into the political domain. It used to have a much more narrow focus on price stability, but it has been given a whole series of new responsibilities. Critics think that it’s time to go back to a narrower definition of the mandate.  When President Draghi said the famous words “whatever it takes” in 2012…  …when he promised in the summer of 2012 to do whatever it takes, within the limits of the ECB’s mandate, to preserve the euro…  …the message was clear: the ECB stands ready to safeguard the integrity of the euro. Monetary policy is not an isolated tool and it does not operate in a political vacuum, separate from the rest of the world. It interacts with fiscal policy and also with structural policies. We don’t live in an ivory tower. But at the same time monetary policy is not almighty. Take the trade dispute or Brexit, which have economic consequences. The ECB can make liquidity available, which helps, but it doesn’t solve the problems.  In his eight years as ECB President Mario Draghi made monetary policy ever more accommodative and he never raised interest rates. You have a bit more than seven years to go. Do you think interest rates will be raised again at some point in that period?  When President Draghi arrived at the ECB, I’m sure that he also expected to be raising rates at some point. But the economic situation meant it wasn’t possible. He did at least stop asset purchases for a while, even if he didn’t manage to raise rates. I don’t know how things will stand two or three years from now. There are models that make predictions for the next 50 years, but life is much more complicated than that.  There’s also the question of whether there will ever be a normalisation of monetary policy, with an end to asset purchases and zero and negative interest rates.  That depends on how the economy evolves, how inflation evolves and how risks evolve. If we see economic activity improving again over the next few quarters, as we expect, and rising labour costs push prices up further, we will adjust our policy. Nothing is set in stone.   "
2019-10-26,Luis de Guindos,Interview with El País,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Luis Doncel on 11 October 2019 ","   INTERVIEW 26 October 2019  Interview with El País   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Luis Doncel on 11 October 2019   Central bankers have become increasingly prominent figures. Would it be preferable for them to go back to being rather low key?  Monetary policy has been overly prominent because other policy areas have not taken action. That’s not good.  Mario Draghi’s term as ECB President is about to end. How will he be remembered?  His mandate was marked by the debt crisis, three country bailouts, the extreme situations in Spain and Italy, and the real prospect of Greece being forced to leave the euro area. With one sentence he made it patently clear that he would preserve the single currency, thus marking the beginning of the recovery from 2013 onwards. The second standout moment is large-scale asset purchases. Despite the challenges of ECB decision-making, he built a consensus for implementing a policy that at the time was strictly necessary. In so doing, he modernised the ECB’s toolkit, bringing the institution into line with the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.  His latest measures have been heavily criticised. Draghi himself has acknowledged that the side effects are increasing. Isn’t it a contradiction to say that the ECB has room to act while, at the same time, warning of the adverse effects of its policies?  You have to find the right balance. We try to take action and do our part, but the side effects are becoming increasingly clear over time. Central bankers are not almighty. We cannot fix problems such as trade wars or Brexit. Fiscal policy, structural reforms and the banking union have their part to play. If they don’t, the side effects will be larger. And that’s what we want to avoid.  Are the fiscal plans announced by governments, for example in Germany and the Netherlands, sufficient?  The patchwork of fiscal policies – national policies and the Stability and Growth Pact – is not sufficient to deal with a severe downturn. The existing framework offers very little scope for complementing monetary policy. That is why I am convinced of the need for a centralised and independent fiscal instrument. It would also provide support to national fiscal policies.  The ECB has not met its inflation objective since 2013. Has it failed to fulfil its price stability mandate?  Let’s not forget that the risk of deflation was averted, and that risk was extremely dangerous. Inflation has indeed been below the objective for some time, but behind this there are structural changes for which we don’t yet have a full explanation.  Is this damaging the institution’s credibility?  No. We would have had a credibility problem if deflation had taken hold. The question is why wage increases are not passing through to price inflation. This is one of the legacies of the crisis a decade ago.  What is Christine Lagarde’s biggest challenge?  On the one hand, the severity of the economic slowdown. We expect growth to be slightly above 1%, but with downside risks. In the financial sector, the greatest challenges are banks’ very low profitability, risks stemming from low rates and the assets managed by the funds industry, which have grown considerably.  The ECB’s policies have had the undesired effect of redistributing income.  They have had a certain negative effect on savers and have potentially pushed up asset prices, but they have also had a positive effect in the form of economic growth, job creation and wage increases. According to our calculations, the net effect has added 2 percentage points to growth. As a result of the ECB’s actions, the situation in Europe is nothing like it was ten years ago.  There has been criticism of the ECB becoming more political and less technical with Christine Lagarde and you at the helm – both of you are former ministers with no central banking experience.   Monetary policy must be just another element that has a place within economic policy. It’s good to have experience in other areas. Central bankers have sometimes been working in an ivory tower. Christine Lagarde – not to mention myself –is well versed in the euro area’s mechanisms. The ECB’s decision-makers need to understand the context, make sound choices from among the alternatives and communicate appropriately. Ms Lagarde will do this extremely clearly.  Internal criticism, resignations, partisan leaks to the press… Divisions within the ECB seem to have flared up in recent weeks.  Strangely, there’s sometimes more politics going on inside a central bank than in governments. Seriously though, the 25 members of the Governing Council should try to build a consensus. And when a decision is made, it must be embraced.  That isn’t happening right now. Are these fights damaging the ECB?  I wouldn’t say they are damaging it, but certainly they are not contributing to the effectiveness of the policies.  Criticism of Draghi is intensifying in the north of Europe. Are you fearful of disengagement from the European project in countries such as Germany?  We have to redouble our communication efforts. The ECB has delivered low inflation and a favourable environment in which Germany has enjoyed ten years of strong growth. Germany has been much better off with the euro.  In September the votes against came from countries that together account for more than half of the eurozone’s population.  I don’t represent Spain on the Executive Board. You have to act with the entire eurozone in mind. The “one member, one vote” system, as occurs in the Governing Council, is especially democratic as it avoids imbalances in the decision-making process. But we clearly have to consider Germany. If the German economy grinds to a halt, we will all be affected. We’re all in the same boat.  Could Ms Lagarde’s arrival ease some of these tensions?  I don’t think there will be a sudden change in policy by any means. I’m confident that everyone on the Governing Council will work together with Christine Lagarde with unwavering loyalty from the outset.  The ECB has just lowered its growth forecasts, but some people think they are still too optimistic.  The slowdown is coming from the external sector, which has a strong impact on countries like Germany. If it does fall into recession, it will be a technical recession and the economy will rebound quickly. The risk is not so much one of recession, but rather of entering a prolonged period of very moderate growth, below 1.5%. This is why players other than the ECB have to get involved.  Is the euro area prepared for a no-deal Brexit?  The financial sector is, yes. But the main impact will not come from the financial sector; it will come from the overall impact on the United Kingdom, which is the second-largest European economy. Contingency plans are in place in the financial sector, but other sectors are not as well prepared.  The Spanish economy is also starting to be a concern.  Spain has enjoyed above-average growth since 2013, but nobody can escape the global slowdown. That said, the Spanish economy can steer clear of a recession if mistakes are avoided, because it is much better prepared than in the past. It is more competitive, its banking sector is healthier and levels of private debt are lower.  And government debt of close to 100% of GDP Did we waste the opportunity to bring it down more quickly in the good years?  Considerable efforts have been made. Spain’s deficit had reached 11% of GDP, but this year it will be around 2%. It’s always the case that more could have been done, but equally less could have been done.  To what extent is the current political deadlock weighing on the economy?  I won’t comment on countries’ internal political issues. All I can say is that I was an acting minister for almost a year, and it’s not a nice situation to be in. A cyclical slowdown is coming, but certainly not a crisis like we saw in 2008.   "
2019-10-17,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow and Piotr Skolimowski on 10 October and published on 17 October 2019","   INTERVIEW 17 October 2019  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow and Piotr Skolimowski on 10 October and published on 17 October 2019  Mr Cœuré, the working group on stablecoins you’ve been chairing is expected to provide policy recommendations to G7 ministers on 17 October. What will be the gist of what you’re going to tell them?  It’s important to expand the discussion on global stablecoins to embrace the broader context of technological changes in payments so that we may have a wider discussion on the mix of solutions – both public and private – that can bring the benefits of technological improvements to the end users. Stablecoins are only one component of this discussion. They raise a multifaceted technological and regulatory debate, covering financial regulation and anti-money laundering, as well as non-financial issues such as privacy, data and taxes. Stablecoins also raise deeper public-policy issues, particularly regarding the definition of money and monetary sovereignty. The report offers a framework for exploring these and related topics. It helps to structure the discussion, starting with how global payments work, what the shortcomings are and how stablecoins fit into this discussion, before addressing a number of issues specifically related to global stablecoins.  How important is it to tackle the issue jointly at the global level?  It’s essential that the discussion of global stablecoins is inclusive. If and when stablecoins become live and reach global scale, they will have a different impact in different jurisdictions. Scale is important here. What we want to see is international cooperation and coordination on regulatory approaches, potentially leading, as needed, to international standards – which we already have in some fields such as payments. All jurisdictions are now reviewing existing regulation to see how it applies to stablecoins. In Europe, the European Commission is carrying out this review. We will have to consider whether the existing regulations suffice or whether they will have to be adapted to address stablecoins. That’s why this discussion is also taking place at the G20 level, and I would argue it should go beyond the G20 perimeter so we can reach out to developing countries too. We very much count on the IMF and the World Bank to help us on that.   Are any jurisdictions more vulnerable than others?  The stakes are probably higher in small, open, developing economies. On the one hand, they may enjoy more potential benefits in the form of cheaper and faster payments, in particular for cross-border payments and remittances, and more financial inclusion. On the other, they may incur higher costs owing to the possible risks relating to monetary policy transmission and monetary sovereignty, in particular in economies which are partly dollarised. “Dollarisation” can easily morph into “stablecoinisation” (with apologies for the neologism!). We’re flagging this in the report and it deserves closer consideration, which in my view the IMF should lead.  This is just the start of what looks like a long process of tackling the challenges of stablecoins. What would be the next immediate steps?  The plan is to pass the baton to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The FSB has launched a new working group on the regulatory implications of stablecoins, which I co-chair with Chia Der Jiun from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This group will focus on regulatory frameworks and approaches, starting with a stocktake of how different jurisdictions intend to deal with stablecoins. This will feed into a report that will be submitted for public consultation in April 2020.  Can you give us a flavour of the scope of the challenges stablecoin projects involve?  The list of issues raised by all stablecoin projects is already quite long, as you know from our July report. They relate to legal certainty – to put it simply, on what or whom is the stablecoin a claim – and also to the governance and the architecture of each project. Other aspects have to do with compliance with money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules and the question of whether a stablecoin payment system is safe and efficient enough. We can use existing international standards as a reference in this regard. Then there are issues related to operational resilience and cybersecurity, market integrity and investor protection, and data protection, particularly segregation between payment data and data being produced in a social network. And you have issues with tax compliance.  Whenever these projects are based on existing global networks, there’s a chance that they may reach a critical size very quickly, which raises additional potential issues relating to financial stability, monetary policy and the functioning of the international monetary system.  According to Kenneth Rogoff, some prominent central banker told him the goal is to regulate Libra into oblivion. Is that a sentiment you share?  The G7 report is not technology-specific and it is not company-specific. There are different stablecoin projects and there will be new ones. We want to set principles that are applicable to all. It’s too early in the process to say whether individual projects will meet these principles. There is certainly no judgement that stablecoins shouldn’t exist. In the case of Europe, neither the Commission nor the ECB intend to make Europe a no-fly zone for stablecoins. But stablecoins will have to meet the highest regulatory standards and adhere to broader public policy goals. When we talk about people’s money, there is no trade-off between innovation and safety. We want to see both, as we do for any payment instrument. Depending on the design and the details of each stablecoin initiative, the approval would be contingent on meeting the highest existing standards. It might also require new regulations and be contingent on adherence to broader public-policy goals. The bottom line is that the bar will be very high and it’s too early to tell whether it will be reached.  Are there any projects that might be easier to handle than others?  I see substantial differences between projects aimed at retail participants and those confined to the wholesale world. It’s more likely in my view that existing regulations would broadly apply to wholesale projects rather than to retail projects. But it’s all very tentative and there’s no conclusion yet.  With Libra, we’re looking at a player that’ll dominate the market. Is that a concern you have?  In the discussion on fintech regulation we’ve been accustomed to discussing small-scale projects. By and large, until recently, we’ve taken a sandbox approach to fintech regulation under which we could afford to give projects a chance and see how risks materialise. That’s possible when the project is small enough. But now we have an elephant in the sandbox. So that approach doesn’t work anymore. What happens if the coin reaches a global scale? You have questions relating to the fair use of client data and to possible services that may not be planned initially, but could develop in the ecosystem, like what happens if a deposit-taking or lending activity emerges around the stablecoin, in which case it should be regulated as banking activity.  Are we then at the beginning of an historic shift in our approach toward money and payments?   The payment universe, both locally and globally, has evolved very rapidly over the past five years. The last wave of technological change in payments was 20 years ago when central banks introduced real-time gross settlement systems (in our case, TARGET followed by TARGET2). The new wave is more focused on retail payments and driven by technology.  Before passing any judgement, we have to start from the principle that innovation is good because it makes payments cheaper and faster. That’s an area where we’re learning a great deal from our African and Latin American colleagues. There’s a lot of leapfrogging toward innovative solutions. In the end, the new landscape will be a mix of public and private solutions. So the key question for the years to come is how to combine core public infrastructures like the ECB’s fast payment platform, TIPS, with private systems, and what impulse central banks can give to make this happen in an integrated way. This is a particular challenge in Europe where the retail payment world remains fragmented along national lines. The Eurosystem is working on it. We’d better act fast here, because we don’t want this new world of payments to be dominated solely by US and Chinese actors. Europe has a particular interest in developing its own approach and standards so it can be safe and efficient at home and attractive as an international reference.  How do stablecoins, private and public, fit into this discussion?  Stablecoins have the potential to leverage technological change to bring new and cheaper services to customers – provided that the long list of risks I highlighted is addressed properly. You’re asking me whether a public stablecoin will also fit into this landscape. That’s an area where we’re treading very carefully because the prospects differ across jurisdictions. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) raise a number of serious questions to which we don’t yet have answers. Although they might look like an attractive proposition for individuals wishing to reap the benefits of technology while holding a safe store of value, they may have shortcomings of their own: there are many ways to implement CBDCs, which we need to study carefully. If they make bank funding more fragile and more vulnerable to liquidity shocks and bank runs, then they might be bad for financial stability and financial intermediation. Central banks shouldn’t have their heads in the sand and avoid that discussion. At the same time, we have to think through the consequences.  If people have access to digital central bank money, isn’t the central bank entering an unfair competition with the private sector?  If the demand for cash in a country collapses, citizens would be left with no option but to use commercial money, even for small payments. There’s a good case to be made that citizens should be offered the option of using central bank money for small payments, even in a digital world. You have an overarching public-policy goal, which is trust in the currency. But again, we have to think through the consequences. As long as CBDCs are using new technologies to do what we already do – issuing money – in a more cost-effective way, I’m all for it. But if that implies a world where the central bank is crowding out private banks and attracting all deposits; a world where the central bank is disintermediating private financial intermediation, then that would not be a place where we want to be, because we’re a market economy and we need competition to generate innovation in the first place.   All those arguments taken into account, are CBDCs part of our financial future?  I’m personally pretty sure CBDCs will come. I don’t know how and in which form. It may come in different ways in different jurisdictions. The nature of money will change. It’s not the first time this is happening – the nature of money has kept changing over the centuries. We’ve got to adapt so we can reap the benefits of technology. But the principles won’t change. I’m convinced that one key evolution that dates back to the 17th century will remain: you need a public institution to anchor trust in the currency. I don’t see any chance that we will move back to a system where money will only be issued by commercial entities and regulated by competition between these entities. Our economies are so complex that you need trust in the currency to be anchored in the rule of law. A social convention isn’t enough. It’s too fragile. That doesn’t mean everything needs to be public. To echo Ludwig Erhard, you need as much commercial money as possible to reap the benefits of innovation and competition, and you need as much public money as needed to anchor the trust in the currency.

2019-10-09,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Market News,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 7 October, and published on 9 October 2019","   INTERVIEW 9 October 2019  Interview with Market News   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 7 October, and published on 9 October 2019  How pessimistic are you about the state of the European economy at the moment?  We have a sort of two-tier economy: on the one side, we have manufacturing and exports, and on the other, we have services and domestic demand. Manufacturing and exports are clearly underperforming the rest of the economy; that’s why we have some differences among euro area countries. Germany, for example, is much more exposed to the external sector. That’s our baseline scenario. But I think the most important point is not so much that the projection has been revised downwards several times, but that we have not included in the baseline the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, or even an escalation of trade tensions. If these downward risks materialise, the growth outlook will deteriorate further, from already very low levels.  Global economic activity has been slowing for some time. The United States and China are engaged in an ongoing trade dispute and the manufacturing sector in Europe, and Germany in particular, has been hard hit. How much longer can the ECB – and indeed fiscal authorities if they were to loosen the purse strings – continue to prop up the eurozone economy under those circumstances?  The capacity of monetary policy to address these types of shocks is not unlimited. We are not almighty; we have to be humble. Other actors have to step in. I’m referring to structural reforms, to fiscal policy, the completion of the capital markets union and the completion of the banking union. If we have an orderly Brexit, if trade disputes are de-escalated, that will be positive for the European and world economy. But the message is that monetary policy cannot address all the problems in the world. We are not the saviours of the world.  You’ve been portrayed as a rather reluctant supporter of the package that was announced on 12 September. Is that fair? Were there aspects of the package that you supported more or less than others?  I’ve always had a very clear approach to the way we make our decisions. This is a collegial institution, a collegial forum. It’s very simple: once a decision has been taken – and the majority of decisions are taken with unanimity – you have to defend that decision. There are 25 of us and, for sure, there are sometimes different views, but when a decision is taken by a clear majority, it is important to defend it. It would be much better if we tried to reduce the level of surrounding noise.  Would it have been difficult for President Draghi to push the package through had a majority of the Executive Board been against it?  The basis of the package was the outlook. Inflation expectations are not de-anchoring, but there is a potential risk that they could do so, and the threat of deflation could come to the fore. That’s why we reacted. The core element of the package was forward guidance. People have not paid much attention to that, but in my view, that was the main, important message. And afterwards we took other measures: cutting the interest rate, “tiering”, targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and finally the asset purchase programme (APP). But forward guidance is the main element and the core reference for how things can evolve in the near future.  One central bank governor recently suggested life would be much easier for the ECB if it simply accepted inflation rates at closer to 1% than 2%. Where do you stand?  Our remit is to achieve price stability, and price stability according to our present definition is below, but close to, 2%. Whether it is symmetric or not is a different question – while it’s not a minor question, it’s not the most important one either. The third element we are perhaps overlooking is the reaction function: how powerful our instruments are in their ability to push up inflation. I think that’s the real point. We have not entered into discussion over whether the target should be modified. It will be discussed by the Governing Council and perhaps with a new president it will be different. But for me the kind of monetary policy decisions you take and the tools you have to achieve the target are much more important.  It’s been argued that tiering is in effect a rate increase…..  No, I don’t think so. Tiering is a form of mitigation. That’s why it was set.   Is it a form of mitigation that lays the ground for further rate cuts?  We haven’t discussed it, but my impression is that -0.50% is the correct level at present, and as to any further cut, we will have a good, in-depth discussion in the Governing Council. One point that I think is particularly relevant is that although we can reduce interest rates further, the side effects of monetary policy are becoming more and more evident and more and more tangible. That’s why we have started to say that other actors have to jump in.   Does tiering help or impede the process of banks restructuring in ways that might offset the negative effects of negative interest rates?  This is a good question. Tiering is some relief, but the reasons for the banks’ low profitability are different. Low interest rates are having an impact, but they’re not the main cause of European banks’ problems, which are much more structural. Some have argued that even tiering, by offering relief, delays the implementation of the instruments that could improve the European banks’ profitability. That is a big problem. We are in a changing paradigm. Low interest rates are going to be around for longer, and this has very little to do with monetary policy. Monetary policy has to adapt to the lower level of the natural interest rate, and we are going to hit the zero lower bound much more often than in the past. This has implications for monetary policy, but also for the banking industry, for the insurance business, for everyone.   Following the restart of the APP, Philip Lane said recently that the question of a shortage of bonds “may not become a problem for an extended period of time, and in any case not for at least as long as we can project bond availability conditions with some confidence.” How long is an extended period of time?  Our calculation is that we have enough time.   But there are some who might argue that the APP was only introduced at the level it was [€20 billion per month] because any higher and you run out of things to buy very quickly indeed…  I don’t think so. Our assessment was that €20 billion was enough in terms of the current situation and the evolution of the ECB’s balance sheet, and not just in terms of the restrictions that we could hit.   So there is still further headroom should it be necessary. Is that the message?  Headroom is there, and €20 billion per month dovetails perfectly with the headroom we have. It will be in place for a period of time. This is a package, and the concept of a package is that you can’t move it every two weeks. The package has to be stable, and we have to be predictable. So if we start saying that we can modify some elements or some parameters within it, we start to undermine its effectiveness. But, again, we are not the only game in town.  It sounds like you’re ruling out any changes at the next meeting.  That will depend on the Governing Council. We will have to see what happens with the outlook. And we will have to see what happens with the downside risks.  Is helicopter money something you would ever consider appropriate, or does it blur too much the boundaries between fiscal and monetary policy?  We need to have an independent budgetary instrument at euro area level with a countercyclical function and institutional governance that is different from the present set of rules. There should be an independent fiscal authority that can determine when there is an asymmetric shock or a problem across the euro area, and then react. And that is something that could be decided as we decide monetary policy. It would simultaneously reduce the burden of national fiscal policy.  Does that mean that it’s going to be difficult for Christine Lagarde to make any changes to the package we have?  The president is very important, because the president sets the agenda and sometimes even the timing of the decisions we take. And afterwards he or she has a very important role in creating consensus, as the more consensus we have, the better for the institution, also in terms of effectiveness of the decisions. But the president aside, the rest of the Governing Council is going to be more or less the same, and this is a collegial institution. And the concept of a package is something you can use perhaps once a year, but not every month, because otherwise you undermine its effectiveness.  Is there a sense in which a new president is like pressing the reset button? Or is it more a straightforward case of institutional continuity?  Strong institutions always have a certain kind of continuity, but the new president is the new president, and she will have her own ideas and approaches to the organisation. But a policy U-turn is something I would discard. And it would not be good anyway.   "
2019-09-30,Philip R. Lane,Q&A with Reuters,"Q&A with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Daniel Burns on 27 September 2019 at Reuters Newsmaker in New York","   INTERVIEW 30 September 2019  Q&A with Reuters   Q&A with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Daniel Burns on 27 September 2019 at Reuters Newsmaker in New York   The following is a transcript of an on stage question and answer.    Let me welcome Philip Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB. That’s a role he went to earlier this year having served as the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland since 2015. He has been an adviser to other international economic organisations, such as the IMF, OECD, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. He has a PhD in Economics from Harvard and earned his BA from Trinity College Dublin where, until recently, he was the Whately Professor of Political Economy. I’m also told he is a Liverpool fan, so he is riding high early in this Premier League season and we’ll see if that confidence extends to team ECB. Mr Lane if you’d like to start.  One reason I suppose that I wanted to talk here this morning was to further explain the context for our recent monetary policy decision. So if you look back over the last few years, if you look at the period from 2014 to 2018, essentially, the decision in 2014 by the ECB to tackle the risks of a slow-growing economy and the deflation risk in the euro area meant that during those years, from 2014 to 2018, what we saw was a fairly significant recovery. We had a big decline in unemployment in Europe, a very strong record of job creation and a significant stabilisation of inflation. So compared with the period in 2014, when deflation risk was on the horizon, there was a significant recovery in the inflation process through that period. And so to more recent monetary policy history, at the end of 2018 the decision was made that enough progress had been made in bringing inflation back towards the target that we would end the net asset purchases. Now in September 2019, part of the package that we announced a couple of weeks ago was: we did a small policy rate cut – the deposit facility rate went from -40 basis points to -50 basis points, we provided reinforced forward guidance and we restarted the net asset purchase programme (APP), running at €20 billion a month. So you may ask: why was that necessary? Well, when we made the decision last December to end net purchases under our APP, the 2021 inflation forecast from the perspective of December 2018 was at 1.8%, so close to 2%. But what’s happened this year? In March there was a significant downgrade in our outlook and that’s essentially been confirmed in June and now in the September forecast. So now, as of September 2019 before we made this policy decision, the 2021 inflation forecast was 1.5%. So compared with 1.8% that’s a big movement, from 1.8% to 1.5%. In that context, the decision was that we needed to revise our policy stance, which as I say is a rate cut, reinforced forward guidance, reopening of the APP and then there’s the redesign of our targeted lending facility and the introduction of this new tiering system for how banks will be exempted, to some extent, from the implications of negative interest rates on their excess liquidity.  So what we have is a very unusual situation, which is that many of the reasons why we were optimistic in 2018 remain. The labour market remains strong, services remain strong, consumption remains strong, household investment remains strong. So where’s the decline? Essentially, manufacturing. So it’s a very unusual, sector-specific asymmetric slowdown at the moment, which is not general across the economy but very, very visible in manufacturing. Of course, when you start to look at that – yes there are Europe-specific issues - but a lot has to do with the slowdown in global trade, which is some mix of trade policy, a kind of revision of the speed of growth in Asia, in particular, and related issues. So it’s a very unusual situation. It’s very important to say this is really not a dramatic policy move, it’s a recalibration. We’re not saying that there’s a serious recession risk, we’re not saying that there’s a serious derailment of inflation, but there was a need to make a correction. And the last point I’ll make in this opening is that it’s very important in these circumstances that you do respond. When you do have inflation below the target, when you already have done a lot of accommodation, it is important, not to react to every little blip in the data. But when you see a significant deviation from the target it’s important to respond, and that’s what we’ve done.  Thank you for laying out the context. So eurozone data continue to be skewed to the downside, particularly in Germany, where there seems to be a risk that this broad industrial weakness could be slipping into services. How significant is that? Is there a case to be made that Germany is already in recession?  So let me make two points about that. One, Germany of course is very much an anchor country for the euro area, but Germany has a really unusual economic structure. It is not representative of the wider euro area because it’s such a manufacturing powerhouse. So the manufacturing slowdown is disproportionately affecting Germany. At the ECB we look at aggregate euro area data, we don’t go country by country, it’s the aggregate that matters. So of course Germany is a significant factor but it’s not the case that… so I think it would be a mistake, in fact I see it every day, it’s tempting to read the German headlines and say this is a proxy for the euro area. But when you have a shock that is specific to manufacturing and when Germany has a much bigger manufacturing sector than, say, France or Spain in proportion, it would not be a good idea to extrapolate. When we say services are resilient, of course those service sectors which are selling to manufacturing are affected, there’s no doubt about that, and then of course the spillover to the wider economy will be stronger in Germany than elsewhere. Let me also emphasise, though, that it remains the case that Germany, even with the slowdown (because remember they had such a spectacular performance in terms of the export dynamo for so many years)… So going back to 2018, 2017 was just an exceptional year, there was a slowdown in 2018 but by and large 2018 was just a little bit of a correction, returning to a more typical performance. What’s interesting going from 2018 to 2019 is it’s more than that, it’s more than just slowing down from a kind of exceptional performance in 2017, but it’s still the case that it’s important to view this as an intermediate situation. There are definitely danger signals, I agree with you, there’s a downward, we say it as well, there’s downside risk, there’s more downside risk than upside risk for obvious reasons, but the central forecast remains intermediate. The European economy will grow, we are projecting inflation to continue to increase, the labour market is very strong, wages are growing at quite a clip now. So it’s a case where we just need to reinforce that by this extra policy move rather than some diagnosis or some major serious movement towards overall recession. Individual countries may tip for a while, but not the overall euro area, we don’t see it.  So I believe the staff forecasts for the near term have the aggregate growth rate balancing around 1%, a little bit above, for the near term. Is that too optimistic?  So as a central forecast, I think the staff work hard to make sure that they strike a balance between optimism and pessimism. I think it’s a reasonable central scenario. But a lot of risk in the world is a little bit bimodal. One of the issues we look at, of course, is trade policy. So the question is will these global trade disputes… Are they going to stagnate? Are they going to escalate and widen to a bigger trade war issue? Or will there be deals? If there are deals, that’s upside risk. If it’s basically stagnating, stalemating, that’s kind of behind the central forecast. If it accelerates, then that’s a downside risk. A local issue in Europe, of course, is Brexit, where there remains a lot of uncertainty and, clearly, if there’s a no-deal Brexit that’s going to be a downside risk. So there are obvious clear events, but these events will be realised one way or the other. So when you have political economy uncertainty either, well, I mean there are always three outcomes. Either the uncertainty persists, and that’s essentially part of 2019. Remember, the original Brexit date was March, end of March. And it’s good news that there wasn’t a hard Brexit in March 2019. But, of course, in the absence of knowing the final outcome that is a source of uncertainty. The trade disputes and so on have been ongoing, the time by which these will be resolved remains unclear. I remember, this time last year when the deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada was emerging: that was an upside risk. I mean that could have gone differently. So let’s see what happens. I’m impressed by how the staff go about their forecasting exercise. They have no incentive either to be excessively optimistic or pessimistic in terms of their own professional standards. But there are clear downside risks. And we can all probably have different views about how likely those scenarios are.  Speaking of policy response tools, there’s a global conversation among the developed world central banks right now about the efficacy of their tools. Your response: a 10 basis point cut, a modest uptick to restart QE. But the tiering is something that seems in its early days to be playing out with some unanticipated consequences and in parts of the eurozone it seems to have the… to be viewed as effectively a rate increase, and you’ve got an incentive for bank arbitrage rather than providing funding for the real economy.   Let me address the tiering issue in a minute, but before I get to that, this issue about effectiveness. It’s very important to put the deposit rate cut of 10 basis points in the context of the forward guidance. And you also have to be able to reconcile what is the connection between these policy moves and the underlying reality, both in the euro area and here in the United States. We’ve had this really big move in long-term rates over the course of 2019. So if you believe monetary policy had no impact on financial conditions, it’s hard to explain why bond yields moved so much this year. I mean, to a degree of course there’s risk premium and so on, but the market understands and you can see it in the forward rates, the market understands that we have the capability. As of now we’ve got the rate where it is, but we clearly signal that, if needed, if there’s further downgrading of the inflation outlook which is perceived to be persistent and requires a response, we can do more. So when we think about what matters for the real economy – the lending rates that banks and other intermediaries offer to firms and households – it’s not just the short-term rate, it’s the rate they expect this year, next year, over the next five to ten years. And when they know that we have the capability to push that even more negative, and the capability through the APP to compress the term premia we are seeing - and this is why the package is there - we do of course study whether this is passing through to the real economy. Are we seeing the lending rates come down? We are, and we know that the financial conditions, in all the data we have, absolutely do move the dial in terms of consumption, investment, pricing pressure and so on. So our assessment is that our tools remain quite effective. Of course, it’s quite different now compared with 2014 when, on top of the normal transmission, you also had the issue about financial frictions. In the same way, in the United States they had this consensus that the most powerful quantitative easing programme was when the mortgage-backed securities market was broken in the United States back in the crisis. So we don’t have that, but it’s still the case that we assess that these are quite effective tools. If I come to tiering… Of course, for those involved in interbank markets and so on, this is something that has led a lot of people to study this. The bottom line is that tiering was calculated based on six times required reserves. This leaves a lot of excess liquidity. When you’ve got a lot of excess liquidity left over, essentially all of the economics, and all of the evidence from every money market you can look at, says that the interbank money market rates will be anchored by the deposit rate. So when this is announced, and maybe in some segments when, as you say, banks are trying to calculate what does this mean in terms of my position and so on, we could perfectly understand and anticipate some degree of trading between those banks with a lot of excess liquidity and those banks which don’t have six times required reserves in terms of liquidity. But this is, if you like, “infra-marginal”, it’s not the marginal trade that matters. The marginal trading is what matters for pricing and for financial conditions. If there’s some degree of trading across banks to optimise these liquidity ratios, that’s just part and parcel of the dynamics of money markets. But it’s a sideshow. We of course have read some of those reports as well. It really is the case that, in the vast majority of money market segments, there’s complete pass through. You can find semi-traded low liquidity minor segments which, temporarily, may have had partial pass-through, but in the grand scheme of things this is a minor issue; there’s been complete pass-through.   Is it your expectation that tiering is going to be successful in buffering consumer rates from unwanted outcomes?  The motivation for tiering is, essentially, in a world where… I wouldn’t want to take a position about the extent to which banks can pass through negative rates to depositors. But to an extent there is some friction where the net interest margin is compressed – they can’t fully pass through these cuts to depositors. The role of tiering is to basically strike a balance, where the ability of banks to sustain credit is what we care about, we don’t take a direct view about what’s in the interests of bank shareholders, that’s not our concern. Our concern is whether there are risks to the credit transmission channel. By tiering, by providing some relief in terms of the net income effects of our policy moves, we think it gives protection against any risk to the credit transition channel. It’s not the case that it’s a situation about making a call about what type of depositors should be protected. Banks may do so, in terms of their own strategy, in terms of who they want to protect and who they want to pass the deposit rate cut through to. That’s a commercial decision.   On efficacy of tools, I believe the latest TLTRO auction at -50 attracted almost zero bids. We also had a fairly hefty prepayment of bonds coming due, so you actually had balance sheet shrinkage in the near term. Do you expect that to be corrected? And to what degree do you expect it to be corrected with the resumption of the APP?  Let me make two points. One is that the recent TLTRO take-up was based on submissions before the policy move. So it is nothing to do with the new policy because the submissions came in before we made our announcement. I think what’s important with the TLTRO programme is that it’s a facility. The most obvious interpretation if there’s a low take-up is that financial conditions are so great that there’s no need to come to the ECB for funding. It’s always been the case that TLTRO take-up has varied quite a bit across banks depending on their ability to raise money cheaply in the wholesale markets. So I wouldn’t draw a direct conclusion. We do expect a significant TLTRO take-up over time based on current conditions, but the degree of take-up is not in itself an indicator of the policy stance., because if the reason why TLTRO funding is not taken up is just that they can raise a lot of cheap wholesale funding, the same outcome is delivered – we’re making sure that financial conditions are so accommodative that banks are able to pass on cheap funding to the real economy.   Turning to inflation, is there an argument to be made that, in December last year, inflation, the outlook at 1.8%... What is it with you central bankers where you want to treat the inflation target as a hard ceiling and you begin withdrawing liquidity as you approach it? Isn’t the natural response then to begin retreating from it, as we’ve seen globally in developed economies?  It’s very important to say that the way the APP works is, basically, mostly through a stock effect. And remember we are reinvesting. So the way I would think of the decision last December to stop net purchases is not to start… it’s the end of loosening. So, in other words, if you say we’re going to maintain this stock at roughly 2.5 trillion, and you’re reinvesting, that is not a tightening because you’re basically saying we have loosened conditions so much, we want to maintain this super-easy monetary policy. So it wasn’t a tightening move at all. Tightening would be to do balance sheet contraction plus lifting policy rates. It is basically saying we think the amount of loosening is now where it should be. We’re going to preserve it; we’re going to preserve this super-loose condition. What we’ve done now is we’ve had a revision, a review – well actually maybe we need it even looser. And that’s a reasonable reaction function. When you have the inflation forecast going from 1.8% to 1.5%, you can’t be indifferent about that. That’s a significant move and the world needs to understand that we will be responding to these significant downgrades by making sure the monetary conditions are sufficient; to make sure the momentum of getting inflation back towards our target is restored.   Your observed inflation, though, is even further off target than the Fed’s. What gives you the confidence that you can, that there’s the lift there to get it back up?  The cornerstone of persistent inflation pressure is what’s happening to wages. A big fraction of the overall cost base of the economy is going to be the total wage bill. Unemployment in the euro area has come down a lot; it’s now in the sevens. The history of the euro area is that when unemployment gets into the sevens then the labour market gets hot enough that we’re seeing nominal wage increases of the order which, if they are passed through, we will have inflation back towards our target. What’s interesting is we are now happy with the wage dynamic. There was a period when unemployment was so high, and then when unemployment was falling, that there wasn’t much by way of wage expansion. Now, in the last year or two it’s significant. We are seeing wages growing, but with the uncertainty we think there are understandable reasons why firms, for now, are absorbing those cost increases in lower profit margins rather than passing through to prices. So under the forecast where we expect the labour market to continue to strengthen, there is significant momentum in inflation. The remaining issue is if the trade uncertainty, the geopolitical uncertainty is lifted, and we think… The history of squeezed profit margins is that it doesn’t last forever. Eventually, because of the economics of many industries, firms have to raise prices. So we do think the basic inflation mechanics remain as usual and it’s just important in this period of below-target inflation that we address it through easy conditions.  It’s a Philips curve argument and here it’s been debated ad nauseum for the last couple of years why we’re not seeing a sufficient response in the United States to wage growth that has been north of 3% annually for the better part of a year. Are you miscalculating where the natural rate of unemployment in Europe is? You’re at 7.5% now, does it have to be substantially lower before you’re going to be satisfied?  It’s the same attitude here. If we are – and that’s a good news story – if we’re saying, in fact, the European economy can sustain even lower levels of unemployment, this is fantastic. I mean the fact that Europe, which historically has a high unemployment problem, can sustain much less... So if you ask me, if it takes longer to hit the inflation target because the labour market turns out to be much stronger than you thought, fantastic. People say if they look historically, and if unemployment is at this level, historically interest rates should be higher than they are now. So we’re not going to have a kind of fixed coefficient model, where we say unemployment is this, so that means we set the interest rate at X. We are saying that unless the inflation pressure is there we have to keep the monetary accommodation as extensive as required. So it is kind of unchartered territory to see unemployment come down so low without inflation, but that’s not bad, that’s good. But it does require central banks to respond to that, to make sure… Because the idea that this good news story about our strong labour markets is inconsistent with delivering the inflation target, that would be a failure by the central banking community. The central banking community has to make sure that its policy levers are set to make sure inflation does get to target in this new world of better-performing labour markets.   So that’s a “lower for longer” argument?   It’s a very interesting phrase; you get this phrase a lot. But let me come back to the forward guidance. I’m not making a call about how long this is going to take, because you’ve talked about downside risks but it’s also the case that everyone’s really bad at forecasting. You know narratives take hold – lower for longer, slow growth – and then some positive surprises can happen. There are obvious political economy surprises – if there’s a good Brexit deal, if the trade disputes find a resolution. Then, also in the real economy, it also depends on the rate of technological progress and other elements, which we are saying, we are noticing globally, that the very strong tech cycle that was there in 2017 has weakened, and again maybe there’s going to be a new impetus in some of the drivers of the world economy. So our forward guidance is essentially “state dependent”, because I’ve an open mind about whether the world will unfold in a positive way and this narrative will be reversed very quickly, or whether the world will be in bad shape and we will have to respond to that. So I know everyone in all communities likes to latch onto phrases, and “lower for longer” is definitely a popular phrase but I wouldn’t be fatalistic about it, because it does depend on important policy choices – going beyond the policy choices central bankers make. Obviously there’s trade policy, fiscal policy and so on.  The Fed as you know is in the midst of a year-long framework review, looking at the efficacy of tools, new ways of communicating, new ways of setting inflation, expectations and targets – and potentially price level targeting and averaging inflation. Is the ECB due for a framework overhaul?  I think it could be good timing. It’s been 16 years since the ECB did a strategy review. Most organisations have a fixed calendar. Every three years, every five years there’s some commitment as an organisation to do a review. Now of course if you go back to 2003 when the last review was done and if you roll forwards five years, it’s 2008. There were natural reasons to postpone the strategy review. And it’s been essentially a situation where the scale of the global crisis, the scale of the European crisis was such that this has been perpetually delayed. But I think now it makes sense. It makes sense now when there’s new leadership, when there’s a correlation. It makes sense also to learn a lot from what the Fed is doing, so there’s been no decisions made but in terms of expectation, I think there’s a strong expectation that some kind of review will be initiated, sooner rather than later.   Do you think it’s realistic for the ECB to entertain a different way of approaching its inflation target? Structurally there are clearly differences to the United States, but what about something that is more overtly symmetric allowing it to “run hot” to make up for a decade of cold?  There’s a lot in what you said there. So this symmetry debate, we have tried to clarify it, because we said in our July monetary policy statement that we view our inflation targets as symmetric. That we will be as energetic… When you go back in history, in the first years of the euro the big impetus was on convincing everyone that the ECB would not be soft on inflation. Many countries had a history of inflation above 2% and so the main impetus was on making sure everyone understood that above-target inflation would need a response. Now in recent years we have the symmetric problem, which is when we are below the target. And going back, from 2014 onwards it’s been clear that the ECB has been a leader in innovating in monetary policy. Because of course the Fed has done many things, but in terms of the nature of what the ECB has done, it’s been quite aggressive in dealing with below-target inflation. So as for symmetry, I think symmetry is there. Now there are other elements as to how do you reinforce the inflation target, especially when you’ve spent a long time away from it. The Fed had a review and there have been many, many studies looking at the pros and cons of make-up strategies of different types. And of course we would have a lot of people looking at these as well. Let’s see what comes out of the Fed review – it doesn’t hurt us that the Fed is ahead of us, because we can learn a lot from what they conclude. But of course I think we have to have an open mind. In the end I would share the same general view, which is central banking by and large has a common technology, it’s a common set of challenges and my bet is central bank strategies will be broadly similar around the world. Of course we do have to recognise the United States is much more of a market-based financial system. In Europe banks play a bigger role and, at the level of detail, that matters. In the grand scheme of things we had this tremendous convergence in central banking towards inflation targeting – officially/unofficially, flexible/less flexible, so by and large central banks work in very similar ways and I’m pretty sure that’s going to continue.   But you’re also, Powell has said this, central bankers are feeling they’re reaching the limits of what they can do to support their economies solely with the monetary policy levers. You’re not getting the response you’d like from fiscal authorities. What would you advise? I mean, in Europe that governments explore finding ways to provide more fiscal support where for more outright spending there seems not to be the willingness? In Ireland you’ve got a tax regime that I think somebody has called “Ireland’s gold”, or “Ireland’s oil” and that’s a unique opportunity there.   So let me aggregate to the euro area. So it’s very important to understand the history of the last 10 years. If you compare what happened in the United States and what happened in the euro area – given the nature of the national problems in Europe, with fiscal unsustainability in some countries, with market speculation and so on – what you had after the global financial crisis was a significant period of austerity in Europe. In the last two or three years, after a lot of consolidation by governments, there’s been a degree of relaxation. So fiscal policy in terms of the rate of growth of public spending has started to be visible after a long period of, basically, being held at zero or slightly negative. So when the private sector is doing well, the ability to run the economy with either neutral or tight fiscal policy – I think the room was there. When you have a slowdown, as we have now in the euro area economy, it varies by country – and fiscal policies are a national decision. So what each country should do needs to respect the individual circumstances. But essentially the way I would view it is that the central bank has to take macroeconomic conditions as it sees them, and especially when the private sector is facing challenges, the overall macroeconomic environment will be heavily influenced by the fiscal choices. And in Europe there are various countries with strong fiscal positions. Some of these countries are also facing slowdowns. So if the goal is to stabilise output, having countercyclical fiscal policy is important. And so of course with a greater contribution from government spending the macro environment will improve and in turn that’s going to influence our monetary policy decisions. So I think it’s important to make sure that the current debate is primarily about stabilising the business cycle and the text books say fiscal policy can play a countercyclical role. Historically it hasn’t always been like that. Sometimes it’s been procyclical. Austerity during the crisis was procyclical in many countries. But now, when fiscal policy is in better shape, the room to be countercyclical is there for those countries which do have their public debt in a good situation and have a good starting position. So what we are saying, and we said it in September in our policy statement, is in these contexts moving fiscal policy from generally neutral, or slightly easy, to a bit more countercyclical will be helpful.   But in the two economies I think seem to have the most room, Germany and the Netherlands, there seems to be no willingness – particularly concerning the political will in Germany.   I don’t particularly want to comment on individual governments, but now in the autumn is when the 2020 budgets are set. So I don’t think there have been any final decisions made. Let me also observe that of course there’s a difference between the United States and Europe, which is that by and large in European countries the automatic stabilisers are stronger. There are bigger public sectors, tax revenues are larger. And so when there’s a slowdown there’s automatic easing. I think in many countries to penetrate what is the cyclical fiscal stance requires a bit of work, because you may have a central budget, but then you’ve got all sorts of different dedicated funds. So let’s see what the decisions are this autumn. But I think for the ECB we have to be clear that we are saying that the macro situation means that a macro view of fiscal policy would suggest that, in some of these countries, a countercyclical stance would contribute to a better outlook for the euro area and their national economies, and in turn for the euro area.   Moving a little bit on to trade, do you see Trump’s approach to trade negotiations, trade policy, as a policy shock? This is effectively Mark Carney’s argument.   Again, I don’t think it’s for me to comment on individual strategies. But the more general issue is – I think there’s a high consensus – over the last several years, something that was basically unprecedented, which is the multilateral trading regime, when that comes into question, for many businesses it’s really hard to make serious investment decisions. Because, having spent many years building global supply chains, for multinational firms having spent many years assuming they can organise their global activities on the basis of a fixed regime, that is now in question. All I can say is, no matter the identities of who is making the decisions, in itself the uncertainty is a problem. And then in itself, if the final outcome is essentially increasing frictions in the world economy, that’s not welcome from an investment point of view. So let’s see what happens.   Would you agree, though, with Trump’s premise that China’s trade relationship with the world had to be dealt with at some point, and is it potentially even worth a recession to bring that to resolution?  Again, I don’t think I want to comment on US political economy. But more generally, my understanding is that part of the range of issues are to do with trade per se. And then there’s other issues to do with intellectual property rights, other elements which can be handled in different ways. Of course, the world evolves, it’s not the case that you go forever without any revision in either trade regimes or other multilateral understandings, so let’s see what happens. But I think the uncertainty in itself, if it continues to be prolonged, it’s a problem.  You’re about to get a new boss. As she’s been on the circuit this week talking about clouds on the horizon, trade is obviously a big concern for her. How involved is she with you now and getting to be where she officially takes office?   Now is late September, so she has a month before taking over on 1 November. I mean, we made this big decision in the September meeting. There will be a monetary policy decision in late October, so one week before, ten days or more before she comes. So I think it’s a very exciting time, the renewal in an organisation. With these eight-year renewals, you know it’s obviously a challenge. It’s also a great opportunity. Obviously, Mario Draghi has been an exceptional leader, but Christine Lagarde I think is going to be exceptional also. She has such amazing experience, both at the IMF and as French Finance Minister, and of course through those roles she’s been very involved in the European debate for many years. And whether it’s in the running of monetary policy or the wider role of the ECB in the European system, I think she’s going to be a really good leader.   There are some pretty deep divisions within the Governing Council as there are now across the Fed, the Bank of Japan as well, how do you expect Lagarde to attack that, do you think we’re going to see a more activist ECB under her?  Of course, it’s always interesting and dramatic to focus on differences of view. The most important assessment in the September meeting was -- after we had a joint assessment in July that inflation was below target – that was confirmed in September, and there was a very high degree of consensus that a monetary easing was required. So I think it’s exaggerated to say there are deep divisions. What is true is that, on individual elements of what we do, there are differences of view. Some of which are kind of structural about the role of sovereign bond purchases in monetary policy, others are tactical. And when you’re in a world where there are pretty big moves in ten-year rates, for example, trying to work out the appropriate response – it’s perfectly reasonable to have differences of view. And it’s perfectly reasonable for that to be heavily debated within the Governing Council. And then for that to be reflected in the public discussion, I think it’s fine. So it would not be accurate to say this is some kind of structural division. A lot of it was to do with – and I’m sure this is true also in the FOMC – there’s an issue about under today’s conditions– not last month’s conditions, not next month’s conditions – what under today’s conditions is the best policy move. And here there was clearly a difference of views. But in the end the decision was taken and that’s the most important news story: to understand what this means, how this is going to permeate the financial system, how this is going to affect the real economy and affect the dynamics of inflation.  We’re ready to open it to the audience Q&A. I’m going to put one more question to you then we’ll do that. Olivier Blanchard was recently positing the idea that we’re potentially on the cusp of a paradox of thrift regime where, across the developed world with uber, ultra-low rates, it’s an incentive for savers to in fact save more and stunt growth because they have such meagre returns on their investments. Do you agree?  So, let me say that when we ease monetary policy, or let’s say when there’s a cut in interest rates, one mechanism which Olivier has referred to there is: how do people respond in terms of their savings behaviour to a lower interest rate. I think the bigger challenge is indirect: if the lower interest rates lead to more investment, more spending in the economy, then incomes go up. So let’s say you get a 5 percentage point increase in income. If you decide to save more of that, it’s still going to be partial, most of that increase in income goes through to consumption. I mean, the correlation is really high. When we look at what’s driving consumption, it’s is your income going up. The second question of “are you, at the margin, changing your saving rate from 10 to 12 or from 10 to 13 or something” – that’s a valid part of the whole debate. But it’s not the case that you’ve a fixed amount of income and you are either saving it or consuming it. The biggest story is: are your wages going up, are your hours going up, is your ability to find a better job going up, which is what we are seeing. On the saving response, what we see –and we do a lot of kind of cohort analysis – so someone who is 15 years away from retirement who wants to get a target in for retirement may well save more. But there are many people who are not in that situation, and there are many households with liquidity constraint. If they would love to buy a new car and the interest rate on the car loan has gone down, they may consume more. So you have to look at the whole aggregate across all those different mechanisms. So I think the hypothesis of Olivier is interesting. I’ve no doubt it’s true to an extent, but it’s not the only issue in deciding whether our monetary policy is effective or not.   Audience member: Regarding Brexit, if they brexit without an arrangement, a deal so to speak, would that hurt the economy of the European Union more and maybe might that encourage the EU to be a little bit easier in the deal they make, because it would be worse for the EU economy if there is no deal. Might that encourage them to make a deal a little bit?  Well, I don’t particularly want to speculate on the dynamics of the negotiations, beyond observing that several years went into making a deal. There was a deal agreed. And of course in the end the European Union has very strong values. The value of freedom of movement, the value of a Single Market and the value of the integrity of the European Union: these are very strong values. So my personal opinion is that the economic factors are not high up on the priority list in the negotiations. It’s more, because that would be very short-termist, it’s very much I think about there’s a very strong vision, a very strong common belief in what the European Union means. And that’s driving - I think - the attitude of the European Union to the negotiation. Of course, if there was a badly handled Brexit it would be negative for the euro area. But remember there’s a very big asymmetry: the euro area economy is so much bigger than the UK economy, so that if there’s harm on both sides percentage-wise it’s going to be a much bigger hit to the UK economy than to the euro area economy.   Audience member: I just wondered if you can take us through some of your trade scenarios that you’re looking at as you see this all unfolding if President Trump is able to reach a resolution with China in the near term, say before the end of the year, how much does that help the European economy to recover, will that get growth going again? By the same token if he is not able to get this taken care of and we go into higher tariffs, particularly for consumer goods, how much does that hurt the eurozone or is that more of a US issue? And then if we go the next round of car tariffs on German cars coming across the Atlantic, coupled with a lot of tariffs that are probably coming near term on aircraft subsidies, how much does that hurt the European Union, can you see that tipping into recession?  So the mechanism for the trade dispute between the US and China is really through what’s happening to the ability of European firms to export to Asia. So the big slowdown has been if you like… slower exports to Asia. And so the pass-through is through that mechanism. Mostly it’s: what is going to be the net impact on, not just the Chinese economy - of course it’s a gigantic supply chain feeding into China from the rest of Asia. So that’s important. But of course it’s indirect. If the second scenario you gave of where the trade war was more directly escalated to production in Europe: of course, that would be a step change. But let me emphasise: in either scenario, these will be quite consequential for European manufacturing. But as I said at the start, European manufacturing - like everywhere - is small in terms of total value added, total GDP, compared to services. So what we’re seeing is this: usually they’re very correlated, manufacturing and services. But the correlation in activity levels right now is far lower than normal. So the big question is whether the rest of the economy, the services economy, the consumption-based economy, construction and so on, how resilient that would be in that scenario. It’s a bit like here in the United States, where there’s this two-track US economy, and in part that depends on the policy response. So we had a discussion that there are levers, most obviously fiscal policy, which mostly will operate through the services sector in Europe. So I don’t think it’s a case of saying that this would be unfiltered in its impact on the euro area. No doubt, it would be a negative, actually it’s a negative. But when you calculate how much of even a big slowdown in manufacturing passes through to overall GDP, we have to keep that in proportion.   Audience member: First, congratulations on an interesting and smart tiering system. I think I agree with you it’s about giving enough balance in excess reserves and excess liquidity. I wanted to come back on the percentage caps for the buying of the programme. You know, there was some confusion also after the meeting because if we think about the 33% cap, is it legally possible for the ECB to buy more than 33%, because if not Germany is already at 31%, they’ll get to 33% in about nine months, so that would mean the QE is pretty much over after nine months instead of the 2023 cap that people had in mind. And the second question is: do you have an estimate for the lower bound for the interest rates and how much you can cut, or is it just to push Germany and the Netherlands and others to act fiscally because the 10 basis points is not doing much and has unintended consequences.   So, on the second question where the ultimate lower bound might be. We watch with interest what the market believes. And the market clearly believes it’s far below where we are now. So the pricing in the market has been where they, depending on the time period, have entertained considerations of interest rates of -75, -80 and so on. And looking at other countries - where rates have gone down to that neighbourhood - my bet is that market participants are just looking to see what’s proven to be sustainable elsewhere. I mean, the big economic question is: really at what level… so there’s always been historically a kind of technical issue which is at what level will depositors decide they’d rather not hold deposits and they’ll hold their savings elsewhere. So that kind of provides a cash lower bound on the interest rate. But that could be quite significant, because it’s pretty expensive to find an alternative to a bank to hold your money. But the economics of this is also: is there a negative interest rate where it’s counter-productive to push the rate lower because it hurts credit creation. I think that that’s very much an open question. This is essentially a reason why it’s natural in the circumstances to move in small steps. It’s natural to move in small steps to make sure you can assess whether any of these counter-productive side effects kick in. We’ve seen more negative rates elsewhere, so I don’t particularly think there’s a technical limit yet.  On the purchasing guidelines: we’ve created this open-ended programme of €20 billion a year. We wouldn’t have done that if we believed there was a kind of a super short-run collision between the purchase programme and the current limits. So I disagree with your assessment of looking at some, to me pretty short horizons, like nine months. So we have much longer horizons in our calculations. But you know the tactics of how we run the purchase programme evolves. So it would be a mistake for anyone to say: well here’s my assumption and here’s what I’m backing. What you should pay attention to is: we’ve got an open-ended programme, we’ve given you conditions under which it will come to an end. And I think the kind of concerns that we would be unable to run the programme, I don’t think you should be too concerned about that. Honestly, at the Governing Council, any potential collision with the current limits is so far in the future that if we’re stuck at that situation, I don’t think that’s top of the list of headaches to worry about.   But do you think you have the authority to exceed the one-third cap?  Again, remember: this is self-imposed, this is an ECB decision about these limits. There’s very good reasons for the limit, but we also have our ultimate mandate, which is to deliver price stability. So we don’t want to raise the limits. There’s good reasons to have these limits and as of now we don’t see a reason to raise the limits. We think the current policy is sustainable within the limits and therefore for now it’s a non-issue. But we’re also clear that all of our decisions have to be in the context of what is needed to get inflation to the target.   Audience member: Have you done or seen any studies of the underground economy and whether or not you factor the underground economy at all into your forecasts and, as part of that question, are you not concerned about the growth of cyber currencies?  In all economies there’s an unofficial sector. So people earning money in the unofficial sector will spend it, to some degree anyway. So in every economy the calculation what’s in the official data versus what’s in the … So this is why everyone always take multiple approaches to calculating the economy. Do you base it on spending, which is more measurable? If you try and base it on income levels, of course you do run into the fact that universally there’s some degree of efforts to evade the official authorities in tracking income. On the cyber currency issue: it’s for now too small to be concerned. It’s a very niche issue, but of course we study it a lot. So, I’m not going to disagree with you: a big part of the global conversation in the central banking world is the future of money, the future of alternative payment systems, money substitutes and so on. But as of now it’s not of direct relevance for policymaking.   "
2019-09-30,Mario Draghi,Interview with Financial Times,"Interview with Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, conducted by Lionel Barber and Claire Jones on 25 June and 20 September, and published on 30 September 2019","   INTERVIEW 30 September 2019  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, conducted by Lionel Barber and Claire Jones on 25 June and 20 September, and published on 30 September 2019 The following is an edited transcript of the interview.  Your new headquarters is very impressive.    Yes and it is also symbolic as it embodies our values. Transparency and independence.  What is the legacy you feel you leave behind?  The ECB’s response to the crisis was crucial in preserving the euro and keeping the European Monetary Union together and always respecting its mandate. Furthermore, the ECB is nowadays a very different institution from the past. The existential challenges that it had to cope with have profoundly transformed it both as far as monetary policy and other key tasks are concerned, but also in its managerial and operational structure. Finally, there is a clear message now that can inspire future work on strengthening our Union. Without a significant fiscal policy for the whole of the Eurozone, this Union will remain a fragile construction.   Before you became ECB president, you were in Frankfurt often as governor of the Banca d’Italia. Did it strike you before you joined the ECB that there needed to be the sort of changes that we’ve seen you make.   The extent of the crisis was clear to me. The contagion had spread throughout the euro area periphery, the banking crisis was peaking with bank runs pushing some banks to the brink of failure, dollar liquidity was insufficient. But as soon as I moved here the policy analysis was wider. The scope of possible actions is much larger than at the national level, the initiative to act springs from this.  Within a few weeks of moving here you took your first action when you cut rates. What were those first few months like?  There is a wealth of information that you have access to only from here. Everything pointed to a situation that was spiralling downward.   We had been in a crisis, then we seemed to have done slightly better by the turn of 2010. By the end of 2011, the credit flows to the private sector were dropping dramatically. The economy was already shrinking. There was also evidence of sovereign and bank contagion.  It was a natural response to immediately lower interest rates once and then a second time, and then introduce the LTRO. The LTROs were not completely without precedent, there had been similar longer-term credit lines. The difference was that these were for three years, and the terms and conditions were much easier. The collateral rules were changed too, some of the earlier experience showed that with certain collateral rules these credit lines might not have been accessed.  You didn’t necessarily expect to become the ECB president.   No.   It was a twist of fate. Were you ready for the job?  I don't know. Up to others to judge.  Did you have a plan?  I had been governor for six years. I was chair of the FSB, previously the FSF. But did I ask myself, ‘Am I ready? Do I know the nuts and bolts?’; no, I haven’t asked myself these questions.  But you did have an unusual array of experiences: financial markets, central banking experience, treasury, international, economic policymaking, and regulation. It’s pretty formidable. But on the other hand you were Italian.  I don't think that ever played a significant role in this. But I should say that the six previous years I had spent in institutions like Banca d’Italia and the FSB, the latter of which had led the regulatory response to the great financial crisis at a global level, were a good preparation for chairing the decision-making process of the Governing Council. As a president, with extensive discussions with the staff and the ECB chief economist, one gathers a deep view of the whole Eurozone, encompassing national views. Bringing this to the Governing Council, together with the collegial exchanges – where participants may be expected to change their minds if facts warrant it – is of utmost importance. That’s why it’s essential that participants should not have dogmatic monetary policy views that cannot be adapted when the facts warrant it. I think this method worked really well. Of course it becomes harder during a crisis, especially in a heterogeneous zone like the Eurozone, where you have countries that have been doing -- by and large -- well throughout the crisis and other countries that have done very poorly.  You said we were heading into a crisis pretty fast by the time you took over. So at that point you had to draw up a strategy.  A crisis so dramatic required a powerful monetary policy response with all the then available instruments, including non-conventional ones.  Between February and March 2012, through the three-year LTROs, we avoided a major banking crisis in the Eurozone which would have had devastating effects in many countries in the Eurozone, and we had to face resistance and criticism even at this early stage.   Tell us how you got consensus.  There was no consensus. These were all majority decisions, but there was a very clear majority since the beginning.  Did that worry you; that you had a rump set of dissidents?  It would have been much better if we had had unanimity from the outset. Once I understood that was not going to be the case, it was a necessary price to pay. This was not without consequence. The prior universal view was that the ECB was fundamentally a very conservative central bank. So, it took some time before expansionary moves could be viewed without a certain degree of scepticism. But this only reinforced our determination. This view -- that we could not act without unanimity, especially at times without the largest member countries -- played a bigger role at the beginning. But then, especially after the London speech was welcomed by the majority of the Governing Council, this view faded away. The London speech was a defining moment for that reason too.  When investors came on board; yes. How much time did you actually try to spend convincing these dissenting voices?  Time is always necessary, especially when the waters where the Governing Council was to navigate were unchartered. And my colleagues and I still spend a lot of time discussing where we go, what we want to do, and so on.  What was – in your view – your decisive argument?  My argument was that they should try to see that this is not a one-country world, that this is a more complex reality than just one country. And monetary policy should be designed accordingly. I think this is the key.  Of course that’s the central story in European integration, isn’t it? A figure like Helmut Kohl certainly understood that this was not a one-country world, in the very telling phrase you’ve just used.  Yes. He certainly did, as does Chancellor Merkel.  So was this an institutional mindset or a national mindset?  This mindset is the product of success. You had a prestigious institution, the Bundesbank, with a successful monetary policy 20 to 50 years ago – when almost everyone else in the world was making one policy mistake after another. But with the euro we had entered a new world. And this world was changing fast.  Furthermore, after the great financial crisis the Eurozone had low inflation and the highest level of unemployment, probably since the Great Depression. The financial system became fragmented and monetary policy was no longer effectively transmitted. In those years, changes in interest rates would no longer be transmitted into lending rates to the private sector.   Yes, this is why new instruments were required.   This is why new instruments were required. It was a world where we went very close to the brink, where even the institutional setup, our monetary union, was put into question. Of course this picture was made even more complex by the fact that this was not true everywhere. In some countries, both the banking and financial system continued to work, but in another part – a big part – of the monetary union, they didn’t. It was definitely a new world.  Who were your most important allies at this point? We all need friends. We all need people who are empathetic.  First, most colleagues in the Governing Council, otherwise I wouldn’t have had a constant large majority for eight years. Second, the leaders of Europe with their continuous understanding of the gravity of the crisis. Third, the supporting opinion of most economists and policymakers, especially the ones who had gone through similarly difficult situations in the US, UK and Japan.  The European Council has always been quite supportive. I’m regularly invited and I am asked to give a presentation of the economic situation of the euro area and on occasion they could have made criticisms — after all, some finance ministers were not shy of making clear their viewpoints. Never in the European Council; I don't think I remember one occasion when there was even veiled criticism towards our policies.  So was there a tacit deal with Berlin that you can be criticised in private, but in public whatever you say is fine?  No, there was no deal, either tacit or implicit. There has been a completely independent relationship. Never a quid pro quo.  If you look at the evolution of this crisis, though, it became a sovereign debt crisis and so then you were faced with even more critical decisions with at least one member state in grave peril and in fact the Eurozone as a result in peril.  The debt crisis had already exploded before my coming here. Then we had Greece, which again went close to default in 2015. On that occasion again the ECB was pretty successful in taking a policy line that maintained the unity of the euro while preventing blatant violations of the Treaty at the same time.  We had two sets of diametrically opposed criticisms there. One was that we should have cut Greece off any line of financing immediately, which would have implied the full collapse of the Greek economy and likely exit of Greece out of the euro; and the other one saying that we should have provided unlimited, unconditional liquidity to the Greek government and the Greek economy no matter what. The support given to Greece was substantial. At its peak the combined lending of the ECB and Bank of Greece to Greek banks reached €127 billion or 71% of the country’s GDP. We did this while the first group of critics was suggesting we should have cut all lines immediately. We continued to finance the private sector with safeguards to make sure that there was no further financing of the state. There was no monetary financing. It was all in all the right way to go because we managed to both keep the euro intact and also avoid circumventing the Treaty. As Peter Praet reminded us at the time, this implied two major changes to the governance of ELA interventions: first, the duration of assistance lengthened; second, the scope of assistance broadened from individual institutions to entire banking systems.  Yes. It was a real balancing act; a tightrope act.  Yes. It was not easy at all.   Did you do a study, though, on the consequences of Greece leaving the euro?  Our job is to look at contingencies. But let me be very clear, on the euro, there was no Plan B.  Why?  Because the ECB has been created with the mandate to maintain price stability and price stability is founded on the existence of the euro. Otherwise it has no meaning if there is no euro. Which price stability or which currency are we supposed to maintain? The dollar? No. The pound? No. It’s the euro. So that’s why there’s no Plan B.  It’s good to hear that. But on Greece clearly there was quite a bit of pressure to say, you know what, let them go.  Yes, but I did say this openly in a Eurogroup to a minister who was suggesting or hinting that we should have cut them off a long time ago. I said: ‘Look, if you want to push Greece out of the euro, you do it. Don’t use the ECB to do it.’  Basically that was calling their bluff.    What do you say to those critics, some of which are in the UK on the left, who say Greece has paid a terrible price for both joining the euro and indeed staying in the euro?  The country was coming from an unsustainable debt financed bubble. The collapse was extraordinarily large and the crisis was terrible. It was overcome first thanks to what the Greek citizens had been able to achieve. But solidarity in the Eurozone has been beneficial. It is very difficult for an isolated country which defaults to go back to normal. The euro area actions have helped Greece, which grew at 1.8% on average over the last eight quarters, with income per capita, after falling roughly 23% from 2008 to 2016, now growing again at 1.6% in 2018, and private investment resuming.   Can we go back to this famous dramatic event in London? History has been rewritten, hasn’t it? Because you didn’t actually plan to say it like this.  Well history did turn out differently from what people in the room expected. Some of that had to do with the sense that the overall situation was very serious. Spreads everywhere had widened. The exchange rate was depreciating not because of any other reason than a lack of confidence in our ability to act decisively. The financial system and banking system were widely fragmented. It was quite clear that much of this was the outcome of a crisis of confidence in the euro. It had to be addressed. It had to be reverted. I was adamant about that. There had been preparatory work in the bank along various lines of possible action. There had also been steps forward in the previous European Council in June with the launching of the banking union which, together with the just established European crisis mechanism and improved economic governance framework, strengthened EMU. Though these decisions certainly helped, and in fact were mostly based on proposals made by the ECB in the previous three years, the substance of the London speech was fully independent of the Council decisions. There was no deal. So there had been a remarkable display of unity by the leaders in taking actions that would eventually make our monetary union stronger.  So to be clear, you did intend to make some kind of statement.  I had reflected, consulted and deeply thought about the appropriate message. I knew I had to make it absolutely clear that the ECB would do whatever was necessary, that only bringing certainty to markets that the ECB was unwavering would put a halt to the downward spiral. I was determined to make that point forcefully. And the markets did the rest.  So once you’d said this and it had a market reaction, did you have a clear plan then of what you were going to do to back it up?  A strong commitment to intervene in an unlimited fashion supported by an equally credible commitment of the country concerned. Given the experience with SMP, that commitment needed to be clearly spelled out and backed by a programme with the then EFSF, now the ESM.  The sense is now that it has acted as a nuclear deterrent. You never really needed to draw on it because markets find it so convincing. Were you convinced yourself at the point you created it that markets wouldn’t test it?   The second meeting was in early September. Then we were ready to be tested. The continuation of the favourable market reaction in my eyes showed that it was really a crisis of confidence that we needed to address.     Yes. That was the genius of it. Did you figure that it might have a chance of working that way?    The message was expected to calm the markets, but I also knew this message would be sustained if the countries undertook reforms needed to cement those lower spreads and to produce sustainable growth.  And of course OMT was crucially upheld in the court.  That pronouncement of the ECJ confirmed the legitimacy of our actions.   To call a cat a cat, if you’re looking at your tenure do you think you’ve had any impact on German public opinion? Well, the ECB. Let’s not personalise it.  The behaviour of the ECB during the crisis, the fact that after so many years we’re still together, that the economy has now fully recovered of course helped.   I would never miss an opportunity to say, employment increased by almost 11 million in less than six years. In the euro area we lost fewer jobs in the crisis and then created more new ones than was the case in the United States. And Germany, the country where our conversation is taking place right now, is actually doing not only better than many others but very well in absolute terms and the best in 40 years. In fact, Germany’s real GDP growth, on a yearly basis, has been positive for 24 consecutive quarters and the unemployment rate stands at its post-unification historical low of 3.1%. Germany recorded both the lowest overall and youth unemployment rates in the euro area. Employment is at an all-time high with 45 million in work in the first quarter of this year. With the labour market becoming tighter, wage growth has picked up more dynamically in the recent years, supporting domestic demand. The euro is as popular today as ever before in its 20-year history.   I’ve lived in Germany myself for two years. Why does one hear so much dissent on monetary policy?  This reaction, which contrasts with the general approval that our measures received in the rest of the world, might partly be explained by the novelty of our measures, and partly by the way central banks’ communications channels work in the eurozone. Banks, insurance companies, pension funds, business models and savers’ behaviours needed to adapt to QE and negative interest rates and this wasn’t easy. We were fulfilling our duty; the Treaty is asking us to take the actions we are taking to preserve the stability of the euro.  Also, explanation of our policies to the citizens of the eurozone relies on national central bank communication. Whenever they supported Governing Council decisions at national level, public opinion at country level was also supportive. Once a decision is taken, dissent should stay within the Governing Council.   We need to talk about today. First of all, if you look at your ammunition chest, how much have you got left?  All instruments from interest rates to asset purchases, to forward guidance are ready to be calibrated. We also need to reiterate that we are symmetric in pursuing our objective, i.e. that to keep inflation above our target as much as below it.  Also, in the future, if the experience is telling us anything, it is this: we have to have a fiscal policy of some significance in the Eurozone. The first time I mentioned this was in a speech I gave in Jackson Hole in 2014 and I repeated it thereafter several times. I always mention the fact of the need to move from a rules-based national fiscal policy to an institution-based fiscal capacity. We have countries that have fiscal space and don’t use it. Even if they were to do something, what would be useful to the rest of the euro area would only be the spill-overs. This means that steering the aggregate euro area fiscal stance in an optimal way through decentralised policies is difficult to achieve given that national policies are geared to national stabilisation needs. Furthermore what is clear is that the current composition of euro area fiscal policies is not optimal. Countries with fiscal space could use some of it to strengthen public investment and increase their growth potential. Member states with high debt with few exceptions are not building buffers needed to provide fiscal stabilisation during the next downturn.   So Mr Macron is right to call for a common European budget?  Monetary policy can do its job, but in the absence of a stabilisation capacity it will only do it more slowly and with more side effects. A combination of monetary and fiscal policies might have delivered similar results on growth and inflation, but faster and at a higher level of interest rates.  It needs to be complemented.  Yes it does.  That’s crucial. That’s the huge lesson, isn’t it? That’s your message in Sintra, but is it politically feasible? How do you get around the German objections?  This is certainly valid. This objection has been there now for many years.  Try 25 years.  There are no lasting monetary unions without fiscal risk sharing both because convergence cannot be perfectly achieved and because regions may be subject to idiosyncratic shocks. Mundell and Bordo have provided extensive evidence that fiscal policy is indispensable to monetary unions. This may be another long journey, perhaps as long as the journey towards the euro was, because of the present political difficulties. But fixing a long-term roadmap to that objective would send a powerful signal that would strengthen the euro area and may even provide additional policy space.  Yes. I’ve read the speech twice and it’s very good, but this fiscal point is crucial. Do you think a new generation of leaders is required to accept this?  At some point they will have to ask themselves the question. I’m convinced that this is an existential part of the euro area that needs to be completed. We can have a long transition. I’m the first to say, transition is bound to be long and it may evolve in ways that we don’t know. Presently even a roadmap may be too much, but a long-term political commitment is essential.  Now, at this point, Jacob Rees-Mogg says, ‘I told you so, it’s the United States of Europe, it’s federalism’.  There are lots of other things that still remain in the national remit.  It’s still a hybrid.  Like all unions. Given the inherent weakness of nation states in a globalised world, what matters is to make the union stronger. In some areas further integration achieves this goal, in others, it is the preservation of the national identities that serves the purpose.  Yes, because this is coming from a central banker who has managed existential crises. But do you think a majority share this view in the council on the fiscal capacity question?  In the Governing Council we discuss monetary policy not fiscal policy but my guess is that many governors would share the same viewpoint. In the European Council they discuss fiscal policy and the last Five Presidents’ Report offered some thoughts on this.  There’s a serious point here about what you said in Sintra. You clearly say, we’ve been flying almost on one engine, right?  Yes, definitely. Everything becomes more difficult.  What do you think, then? Nobody knows what the next crises are, but could things get even rougher in the next phase?  From an institutional point of view the EMU is stronger than it was before the crisis. We have the banking union, the capital markets union, and so on. Also the economy is now doing better and most of our risks are produced by events that are taking place outside the eurozone, think about trade disputes, Brexit, geopolitical tensions, where we are on the receiving end. Of course, we have our own political fragilities, as one would expect from a union with nineteen democracies.  Did it worry you when you were attacked by Trump the other day?  No.  Does Trump worry you?  I was not worried.   But in general, this has been the most extraordinary period where the central banks have actually had to rescue the system, so to speak, and we’ve had this persistent low inflation. Inflationary expectations are lower than just before you launched QE.  Yes.  So the question is, how do you get out of this deflationary mentality and indeed the low interest rate environment?  The answer is to persist with monetary policy. Although, as I said before, fiscal policy could greatly help. We mentioned maintaining the extraordinary stimulus, and this may have to last a long time if there is no support from fiscal policy. Having said that, inflation expectations are actually going down everywhere. There is a structural component which keeps inflation low because otherwise it would only be a eurozone phenomenon. I’m not saying this with any degree of complacency, by the way. We’ve got to continue being persistent, patient, prudent.  The situation is improving, nominal wages are now growing at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent for the euro area and more in certain core countries. This sooner or later will translate itself into higher inflation. It’s just taking longer than we thought.  Do you still think a hard Brexit is a possibility?  It would not be for me to venture into hypothesis, but simply if you compare the likelihood of hard Brexit today with what it was four months ago, one has to admit it has gone up.  It has gone up, but there’s no Plan B. Or is there?  We have addressed all the possible contingencies within our remit and we worked extensively for three years with the Bank of England. But of course being such a broad-ranging event, risks remain.   Just in terms of the populist climate, there does seem to be a common vein that they are attacking central banks and attacking central banks’ independence. What do you do in response to that?  Central banks were made independent because independence is the pillar of their credibility. The best response is therefore to continue to pursue our mandate. If central banks deliver what they’ve been tasked to do, that’s the best answer to some of these concerns. It is also essential to explain better and better what we do. Communication again. Frankly I think it would be a mistake to reverse central bank independence. I’ve lived in periods when central banks were not independent and it was definitely worse.  So I’ve got to find a way of asking politely, all great leaders think about their succession…Yes. It’s a political decision, but how far do you feel what you say and do now is in effect intended to exert influence beyond your tenure?  Succession is a fact enshrined in the Treaty. Decisions about it are a political task. My duty is only to continue to serve the mandate until the very end of my term.   So just thinking ahead, if you had to identify the two or three things you’re very concerned about now and possibly contingencies, what would they be?  Growth has weakened in most advanced economies, especially where trade and manufacturing are important, such as Germany and Japan, with GDP growth projected to be at or below 1% in both countries this year. Global trade volume growth has slowed abruptly, from around 5.7% in 2017 to around 1.4% in the first quarter of 2019, in year-on-year terms. Near term trade prospects remain weak.  Good. Can I ask you a parochial question? What is the impact going to be of Britain leaving the European Union politically and economically?  It’s going to be a loss for the European Union from all viewpoints and I think there is nothing more to add to that.  Is it going to change the geopolitical dynamics?  Too difficult to guess which way.  There are still some concerns that when you depart, when another person is sitting in your chair, that the market might pay more attention to them having to operate ‘within our mandate’, rather than your willingness to do ‘whatever it takes’. So is the OMT watertight? Do we have a true lender of last resort facility for the Eurozone or do you still need a safe pair of hands in Frankfurt and in Berlin and other European capitals?  Yes OMT is watertight, as well as other key decisions taken by the Governing Council during these years. Of course, all policy decisions depend on the circumstances, but I have no reason to think that people who will be sitting in those chairs in the coming years will interpret the mandate in a way different from what the Governing Council that met in the summer of 2012 actually did.  What is your opinion on the nomination of Christine Lagarde as your successor? Is it a disadvantage that Ms Lagarde has no formal training as an economist?    She will be an outstanding ECB president and I say so with full knowledge, having known her for longer than she and I want to remember. She has successfully led the IMF and its staff of economists through challenging times. Also, there are many similarities between the way decisions are taken at the ECB and at the IMF. As I said earlier in our discussion, work at the ECB is collegial, relying on extensive discussions with the staff and the chief economist, as well as the rest of the Governing Council. This is not so different to how the IMF works. Ms Lagarde and the ECB are very well equipped for the next eight years.  There is a growing feeling that central banks, including the ECB, have shouldered too much of the burden and can no longer be the only game in town. Is the era of the omnipotent central banker past its peak?  I talked about fiscal policy as a necessary complement to monetary policy since 2014. Now the need is more urgent than before. Monetary policy will continue to do its job but the negative side effects as you move forward are more and more visible.   The ECB has undershot its inflation target much more than other central banks. Why is that?  Have we done enough? Yes, we have done enough -- and we can do more. But more to the point what is missing? The answer is fiscal policy. That’s the big difference between Europe and the US.  There has been a backlash against the most recent package by some of your colleagues. Why did you want to do such a big package? The bigger the package, the bigger the reaction?  Disagreements about policy happen everywhere, not just in Europe. The outlook has worsened, especially for manufacturing. Inflation was no longer on track to meet our target. And our policies will continue to work, albeit at a slower pace than if governments were spending more.   On the euro, the house is still standing but it is a bit rickety.   The house is not rickety. What I see looking back is progress on banking union, on capital markets union -- but EMU is still incomplete.   It just needs a new extension?  To have a stronger EMU we need a common eurozone budget. Clearly the political debate on that still has a long way to go. But I am optimistic. Many more people understand the importance of these reforms than a few years ago -- there will at some point be a commitment.  You don’t think we could go backwards?   No. People have understood the benefits of the single currency. Trust is going up. The opponents of the euro have not succeeded.   "
2019-09-26,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 24 September 2019","   INTERVIEW 26 September 2019  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 24 September 2019  Mr Lane, the ECB launched a big monetary policy package in September. Was that really necessary?  In my view, it wasn’t such a large package. We reduced the interest rate that banks are charged on their deposits at the ECB by 0.1 percentage points to -0.5%, and we adjusted our forward guidance on the outlook for interest rates. That’s not dramatic. And we decided to conduct net asset purchases at a rate of €20 billion per month, which is much less than the peak of €80 billion a month that we had in the past.  What made an impression on many observers was the fact that these measures are not time-limited. Will we have to live with negative interest rates indefinitely?  Our measures will stay in place until the economy recovers and inflation robustly converges again towards our aim of below, but close to, 2%. This forward guidance dependent on the inflation outlook is the key element of our September decision. It is especially effective under conditions of elevated uncertainty as it facilitates a smooth and stabilising adjustment of expectations about the future policy path to the arrival of positive and negative news. It is only if you are very pessimistic that you take this to mean a very long time. But there are good reasons not to be so pessimistic, also because of our policy actions.  What economic developments do you expect to see?  Our expectation is that we are currently going through a patch of temporary weakness. Inflation is below our aim, but there is no danger of deflation, meaning a general fall in price levels.  So why did you loosen monetary policy at all in September? Couldn’t you just have waited for the soft patch to pass?  Projected inflation for 2021 stood at 1.8% in December 2018. But in March this year the ECB had to revise its outlook for growth and inflation significantly downwards, and in September projected inflation was revised down again to 1.5%. So we waited until September to provide a comprehensive response. When there was no improvement by that point, we took action. In the medium term we want to see a stronger economy, higher inflation and definitely also positive interest rates again. In September we judged that in order to get to that point, interest rates had to be lowered.   What are the assumptions on which the ECB bases its projections?  Our baseline assumption is that there will be an orderly Brexit and the trade conflicts will be resolved. But there are still prominent downside risks.  Let’s talk about the individual measures. Economists on the outside as well as members of the ECB’s Governing Council have been critical of the asset purchases in particular. The Governing Council seems to be divided.   The difference of opinion stems from the fact that the economic situation is not very clear. In the past, it was usually fairly obvious what measures needed to be taken.   And that’s not the case right now?  We’re looking at a temporary economic slowdown, but there is no recession and the risk of deflation is low at present. There is broad agreement that the situation warrants action, and that’s what’s important. Opinions diverged only on the size and type of measures to be taken.  Some central bank chiefs, including Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, publicly criticised the decision immediately after it had been taken. Does that damage the ECB’s credibility?  I don’t think it’s a problem for the outside world to know that there are a number of different viewpoints, because that shows that we strive, collectively and collegially, to reach the right decision. Incidentally, it’s quite normal for there to be differences of opinion at other central banks such as the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve. The important thing is that we make the decision collectively and implement it collectively.  But how do you explain the fact that the ECB is planning to buy additional government bonds even though their yield is already below zero?  The reason yields are so low is that the economic outlook has deteriorated and the market was already expecting us to loosen monetary policy in response to that deterioration. If we had not done so, rates would have risen, and that would have exacerbated the weakness in the economy.   Many economists are arguing that the German government in particular should be doing more in terms of fiscal policy to support the economy. What is your view?  Countries with high levels of government debt should concentrate on structural reforms. But large countries with sound finances can stimulate demand during a period of economic weakness through public spending or tax breaks. So when they’re planning their budgets, governments should think about what developments they expect to see in the year ahead. Private consumption and private investment have both fallen recently.  If fiscal policy doesn’t do its bit, does that weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy?  Monetary policy can change aggregate demand. At the same time, its effectiveness is dependent on how overall demand is expected to develop in the future: the better the prospects, the stronger is the monetary stimulus on the economy. The government can influence the expected evolution of aggregate demand through fiscal policy. The weaker this evolution is expected to be, the more monetary policy has to do.   How big is the potential impact of fiscal policy, in your view?  Two conditions need to be met for government spending to be effective. First, it works particularly well when the economy is not running at full capacity. Second, it’s important that, if the government increases spending and stimulates the economy, it doesn’t cause inflation to rise too far. If that were to happen, monetary policy would need to take counteracting measures, thereby reducing the impact. And there is no risk of inflation being too high at the moment. In addition, the positive impact of government spending is particularly strong in an environment of low interest rates. Additional spending gives firms additional reassurance that their investment will be met with demand.  Would closer cooperation between monetary and fiscal policy be warranted at such times?  There’s a good reason why central banks are independent. So I wouldn’t talk about cooperation. But it can only help for governments to have a good understanding of how our monetary policy works. That’s why we’re very transparent on this.  What do you mean by that?  Anyone in the finance ministry can see that euro area inflation is well below our objective. And that means that higher public spending will not dramatically affect financing conditions.   Let’s go back to monetary policy. Which measure do you think is more significant, the interest rate cut or asset purchases?  The important thing is that they work together. The rate cut allows us to steer interest rates of short and intermediate maturities, in particular, through the expectations component of these rates. Asset purchases can complement this effect by containing the so-called term premium of longer-term interest rates.  How much room for manoeuvre do you have left when it comes to cutting interest rates?  The effect of a rate cut is stimulative because it fosters more favourable financing conditions. We need to see whether, at some point, there might be side effects that work in the opposite direction. We have to look at this again every time. Our monetary policy has so far had a clearly positive impact on financing conditions for firms and households, and is thus supporting growth and inflation.   How low can interest rates go before they start to have a constraining rather than a stimulative impact?   The traditional view is that interest rates can continue to fall up to the point at which people withdraw their money and put their cash in a safe. For some time now, other economic effects have also been taken into account, with the question being whether, as a whole, further interest rate cuts have the desired monetary policy effect.  If people don’t earn any interest these days, they need to save even more for their old age and can consume less as a result.   Yes, but you do need to see the overall picture. The size of incomes is the key factor when it comes to economic development and, in the final analysis, also savings: the higher are incomes, the more can be saved. And expansionary monetary policy boosts incomes, partly through employment and wage growth. Furthermore, there are not just savers; there are also borrowers who benefit from low interest rates.  So you could lower interest rates even further?  Yes, we see enough leeway for further interest rate cuts, should they be necessary. There are some countries, like Denmark and Switzerland, that have lowered interest rates even further.  Could the ECB cut interest rates as far as those countries have?  We do of course look at the examples in other countries. That said, the euro area is a much larger economy than Denmark or Switzerland, so the situations there are only comparable to a limited extent.  Your monetary policy works through the entire financial system. How important is it in this context for the banks to make decent profits?  It can be important at least. This is why we adopted “tiering”, or allowances up to which banks can deposit excess liquidity with the ECB at 0% interest. A monetary policy problem would arise if the banks became reluctant to grant loans due to excessively weak earnings. But we haven’t observed that yet.  Nevertheless, people are asking whether, with such low interest rates, we are approaching the point where monetary policy is no longer effective.  Monetary policy is still effective, as we’ve seen over recent years. The fundamental mechanisms have not changed. At the same time, it is clear that we need to act with great care as our interest rates are already negative and we’ve already built up a large portfolio of bonds.  So why is inflation reacting so little to your monetary policy?  We see that wages are rising, particularly in Germany. For some time, prices followed suit. But companies are now facing huge uncertainty, due mainly to Brexit and the trade conflicts. This is why they are reluctant to pass on the increase in labour costs to their customers.  I have a technical question in this context. The ECB is only permitted to buy around one-third of the government bonds issued by each country. Some economists have calculated that, with new purchases of €20 billion each month, you will already reach a limit, primarily in Germany, after less than a year.  According to our calculations, this may not become a problem for an extended period of time, and in any case not for at least as long as we can project bond availability conditions with some confidence. It is important to keep in mind that the forecasts depend on many parameters you assume. One of these is the price elasticity of those investors who hold the bonds in the private sector. Building on past experience, these investors have proven more willing to sell, even in response to relatively small price adjustments, than we had anticipated. This makes our life easier as it eases constraints.   For some time to come means that you believe the limits for Germany will not be reached in the next one to two years?  If we had seen any potential constraints in this regard in the near future, we would have included this in the calibration of the additional purchases.  Do you assume that some countries will increase their debt?  No, such considerations do not play a role in our calculations. We work on the basis of whatever the governments have already agreed.  If the limit is reached, the ECB could of course also deviate from the key according to which purchases are weighted by the size of the respective euro area countries.  We will continue to purchase with a view to bringing the share of the PSPP portfolio into close alignment with the respective national central banks’ subscription to the ECB capital key.   Some critics also accuse the ECB of effecting its monetary policy primarily via the exchange rate.  The sole objective of our monetary policy is to fulfil our mandate of maintaining price stability. The exchange rate is of course one factor for the economy, and hence also for inflation; in this context, the exchange rate is an important element but not the objective of our monetary policy. What’s more, we haven’t seen any major change in the euro exchange rate for some time now.  But the announcement of asset purchases put the euro under massive pressure in 2014….  … after it had risen sharply prior to that. This was a correction of a previous overvaluation.  Seen overall, the euro area has generated a trade surplus over recent years. That would normally strengthen the euro in the long run.  Experience suggests that such an impact does exist, but it is very, very long term. It develops over decades rather than years.  Let’s turn again to the core of monetary policy – the inflation aim. For a number of months now, the ECB has been speaking of symmetry in its aim. At the same time, though, it is maintaining that inflation should remain below, but close to, 2%. How does that fit together?  First and foremost, it means that we combat deviations above that aim and below that aim with the same determination. If inflation is above our aim of inflation at levels that are below, but close to, 2%, we try just as hard to get it there as when inflation is below the aim.  But isn’t it foolish to set such precise targets? Surely the ECB is not able to steer inflation that accurately.  We’re aiming for this in the medium term, not for a specific year. Which gives us some room for manoeuvre.  How long exactly is the medium term?  That depends especially on the source of the shock. A demand shock requires a shorter horizon for the policy response, that is policy should be less patient, whereas a supply shock may call for a longer horizon, and hence more patience.   Wouldn’t it make sense to allow more downward scope in the inflation aim?  The aim must be crystal clear, especially when inflation is low. The closer it is to zero, the more pressure we find ourselves under to act.  Some critics think that a temporary bout of deflation would not be a disaster.  If it comes from a boom in productivity and higher real incomes, and ends foreseeably quickly, then no, it’s not. But it must be certain that inflation can be anchored above zero again. Close to 2%, to be precise, otherwise the room for manoeuvre in our future monetary policy would be permanently limited.  The Federal Reserve is currently reviewing its monetary policy strategy. Should the ECB follow this example?  I believe that it is time for a review. The world is changing. For instance, we should analyse how other central banks behave when it comes to inflation targets. The importance of monetary policy instruments should also play a role. The best way might be to carry out a review at regular intervals.  If it comes to a fundamental discussion of the new strategy under new ECB President Christine Lagarde in future, would a change in the inflation aim also be conceivable? Maybe also a higher objective?  An objective of around 2% has established itself as the international norm. Deviating greatly from this could create uncertainty and pose risks, as it could, for example, generate undesirable capital flows, for instance.    "
2019-09-19,Philip R. Lane,Q&A with Bloomberg,"Q&A with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stephanie Flanders on 16 September 2019 at Bloomberg in London","  Q&A with Bloomberg   Q&A with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stephanie Flanders on 16 September 2019 at Bloomberg in London   The following is a transcript of an on stage question and answer following Mr Lane’s speech,     Reflections on monetary policy    .     I did take the precaution of inviting mainly economists today, so I think they will have found your speech very exciting and interesting. Whether a broader cross-section of London would have had the same reaction, we don't know, but it doesn't matter. You've often said, particularly in times of unconventional policies, how important communications are for monetary policy. A lot of the communications that we've been talking about over the last few days, since the package was announced, have been negative communications from members of the Council who have made very clear their opposition to at least one part. In some cases that's been – the criticism and the opposition seems to have been – not just from what you might call the usual suspects. Are you worried that the amount of talk about that opposition has distracted from the package or limited its usefulness in the short-term?   Lane: Of course it's natural, every central bank that I know of does a range of these different views at the moment. How do you deal with below target inflation? So if you look around the world, this debate is everywhere. It’s about the imperative to move as quickly as you can to reach the inflation aim versus recognising side effects and so on and maybe having a different view about how quickly and how proactively you should respond. So it's natural that the same debate would also be taking place among the members of Governing Council. I think the fact that there may be, as you say, there's been, an open reflection of that, to me is quite healthy. It's saying that the discussion we have is serious, all points of view are discussed, but in the end the decision is made. So more important than the noise about the collective decision as embodied in the introductory statement versus the fact that there's a range of views around that is: this is the decision; this is the decision when we move these levers and provide the decision about forward guidance. That's the core to communication -- we are clearly communicating about the current policy path, the current decision about APP and the forward guidance.  Of course, future Governing Council can revisit this decision. But this decision was made and as the President said last week, no vote was necessary, there was a sufficient majority to back this decision. In the same way, at the Fed or Bank of England, there's not that many votes that are unanimous. There will be differences of views and the European Central Bank making a significant decision in line with its mandate, I think is – I don't disagree it's novel to have this amount of discussion – but that reflects the nature of this world we're in, the seriousness of the issues, and there are important points of view on all sides.   Before, we were talking about companies and we were talking about governments, we often talk about the principle of collective responsibility. You can have lots of debate beforehand, but once the decision is taken, the perception is that it's costly to have noises off and continued criticism. Would you say it is unhelpful from now on if people continue to state their opposition?   Lane: No, I think I disagree. So first of all, there's a high degree of consensus about needing to act. The detail of how you assemble the package is secondary. The most important message, which is also reflected in the July statement, is: the current situation is not satisfactory and we need to act. That is the most important message. The fact that there's a difference of views about how you use each lever is maybe secondary. I think it would be fake to supress the fact that it's a range of views. So I'm okay with open disclosure of different points of views.  There has been sustained opposition to that particular part to quantitative easing by at least one important member of the Eurozone for many years. We're used to that. Do you think long term it's sustainable to continue with a policy that is opposed by two of the most important countries in the Eurozone? Is that undermining…?   Lane: I'm very glad you asked the question because it's very important to remember: everyone on the Governing Council is there as an individual. So the way you phrase that suggests there are national points of view, which there are not. It's very important that we recognise everyone there at the Governing Council is making an assessment of what is a good idea for the euro area. I don't - we don't - think of it like that and I don't think it's a good idea to frame it in that way. But let me emphasise, as you indicated, it's possible to have a view of especially sovereign purchases from a philosophical point of view. It's also possible to have it from a tactical point of view, as in do current conditions warrant it or not. Clearly, there are individuals in either camp.  Maybe coming back to the chart I have shown about the ten-year rates [Chart 13]): we have seen this big move this year. Interpreting the big move this year, does that mean financial conditions are easy? Or does it mean there's been a downward revision about future prospects for the world economy, where if we didn't respond to that downbeat assessment by demonstrating our willingness, our imperative, to move policy rates in the right direction? I think that's part of the intellectual debate.  Well, to get to that debate, if you compare the current restarting of bond purchases with the beginning of 2015, when it began, at that time the headline inflation was negative, the confronting of a compelling deflationary threat. Some of the criticism would be: you've taken QE from being something for special occasions to an everyday conventional policy by doing this in response to a relatively small change of conditions.  Lane: Let me answer first of all, the way to think about the change of conditions for me anyway. If I go back to December last year, where we ended the net APP, the projected inflation rate for 2021 was at 1.8 %. In the most recent release it's 1.5%; that's not a minor movement. So when you have a big movement of 1.8% to 1.5%, then you have to respond. Essentially, in that situation when we are in an unconventional space - the deposit rate is negative, APP is an unconventional instrument - and the question is - in a world where there clearly is discussion about negative side effects from either instrument - operating at both margins from one perspective is safer and more effective than loading it all on same – the deposit rate. So I wouldn't say we're normalising the APP because we're far from a conventional environment right now. This programme now is a re-opening. It's not some radical change of attitude. The conditions in which we shut the programme of net purchases last December are not conditions we face now. So the fact we've reopened an existing programme I don't think is a very dramatic decision.  What is the impact? You talked in detail, and have in the past, about what the impact different elements of the package might have on prospective inflation and expectations. Taken together, what is your estimate of the impact this will have on inflation in the forecast horizon?  Lane: First thing that's important to say is - because there's a lot of debate about the effectiveness out there, and our staff, we've a lot of staff working and the calculations are with the updated data - it remains the case, both instruments, both moving the deposit rate more negative and increasing stock of APP are effective. They pass through, we see it in the data. They continue to pass through at the lower level of lending rates facing firms and households. In turn, all of our models do say lower lending rates and firms and households do stimulate investment and consumption. So the effect, that we've assessed these tools to continue to be effective  As effective? Sorry, just to put in diminishing returns, you might say they're effective but not as effective.  Lane: Let me come back to one element of that in a minute. Of course, the overall impact we assess as significant. We wouldn't do it if it was basically invisible in the data. We do think this will visibly move the pathway for the outlook of inflation, but of course it's hard to demonstrate. There's a whole range of different techniques: you can use structural models, you can use data models, you can do different ways of tackling it. Across those rates of models, we're convinced that this will have a sufficiently significant positive contribution to inflation. It makes sense to do it. Coming back to the diminishing returns, everyone agrees: QE has a different mechanism when there's a financial crisis. Whether it's the Fed's purchase of mortgage-backed securities during the crisis, whether it's the 2014/15 intervention in the euro area, when there were a lot of frictions in markets, clearly that mechanism had a powerful effect because you're getting rid of frictions. But let me emphasise: even after those frictions have greatly diminished, as in the last recent years, it remains the case we visibly see an impact of APP on the funding costs of corporations, the funding costs of banks and in turn to the lower funding costs of banks, to the lending rates charged by firms and households. It remains quite effective and again even this phrase – I read it all the time – ”diminishing returns”, compared to the peak impact when you have a financial crisis, it's less. But I'm not so sure it's continuously a sloping function that it's continuously edging towards zero.  Just to distil it into the basics, you talked about how this was a significant change in the forecast that had produced this change. The change was a reduction in the forecast on the order of 0.3. When Mario Draghi says last week, “this is sufficient”, that's because the ECB believes, all other things being equal, this will have that order of effect on the forecast, 20 or 30 basis points.  Lane: I'm not going to disagree with that estimate, but I don't want this to focus on one particular number, because obviously it depends on the model you use. It depends on ancillary assumptions, but that order sounds okay to me.  When you say you don't want to focus on one thing, what therefore people want to understand is: what will you be looking at if you're putting everything on the future, on the assessment of the robust return to inflation close to – at target or close to target, what else should we be looking at? What constitutes a robust convergence?  Lane: I don't think it's too complicated to work out what these phrases mean. Because by way of contrast, by way of a counterexample, you can have flat-out convergence in the inflation outlook, meaning you can see a surge in the target. You can see headline inflation could be quite persistent but not in a robust way, because it would be driven by some disruption in oil markets, you can see those sometimes, or other disruptions that come out of the markets. So you can see a non-robust convergence because of what's happening with the model components. Robust, basically we understand as: this is not for a quarter or two quarters, this is going to last.  The second part of the guidance is that it's basically aligned with the realised path, the underlying inflation dynamics, because you could possibly, you don't want to have a modelling error where you see the economies would take off like a rocket and so you say inflation is going to accelerate really sharply. I'm sure models exist that would have that feature, but given the persistence of inflation, which many models don't fully capture, we are saying we also need to see actual inflation, the outcomes, especially across the indicators; especially we need to strip out the volatile elements sufficiently in the neighbourhood of where you want to get to. Everyone's going to agree: yes, it's credible to say compared to where we are now, these forecasts you have, this outlook assessment you have is credible.  In order for rates to go up, you have to be forecasting inflation targets however you're interpreting it at that point, and that has to be a credible forecast given that…  Lane: So, some people will say - you think - that the jump is too big. So, if inflation today is low and you forecast a high number two years from now, it's fair to say, well, we've not seen it. We're seeing inflation move maybe sometimes in an incremental way. So the connection between the outcome and the forecast is basically saying there's a modelling error and maybe it's safer to wait until the actual realised inflation is not too far away.  It's fantastic to have this conversation with you, just a few days after this major event, so thanks again for coming here. I know people in the audience are going to want to ask questions. I have a couple more things. When I listen to Mario Draghi and particularly the tone of the conversation around fiscal in the last couple of months, which has been slightly different from even his previous comments, and I look at your very explicit charts about the effect on the output gap in the Eurozone, it seems to me that the ECB is saying: when it comes to next responding to the ups and downs of the cycle, potentially downs over the next few years, fiscal is the new monetary. Is that right?  Lane: I don't think that's the way to think about it. I've skipped over it, as I was conscious it was running a bit long - but in the concluding section of the speech, which I'm sure is online by now on the ECB website, I do emphasise that our mandate is unconditional. We will do what it takes.  Whatever?  Lane: Whatever it takes to get through to inflation and align it with our targets. So we are not saying that fiscal is the new monetary, far from it. We are making the empirical point that the macroeconomic environment we face does depend on fiscal strategy, and more broadly the policy strategy, because part of what's confronting Europe is a slow potential growth rate. So some elements are about what kind of reforms, what kind of bulk investment will allow greater optimism about the long-term future? But there's also a cyclical element, which is what that chart was conveying [Chart 17], which is - retrospective, looking backwards. We all understand the reasons why we had this pro-cyclicality through the crisis. With the rebuilding of fiscal balance in recent years, fiscal policy has been neutral and a little bit expansionary. What we're saying in the statement last week was that from a cyclical point of view, we are showing here that we will provide more accommodation.  Obviously, the pass-through - and this goes back maybe to what you asked me about the mapping for the inflation outcome - it obviously depends also on what's happening with other policy levers, especially fiscal, so the impact of our policies on inflation does depend on the fiscal decisions. Now in September, governments across Europe are actually making decisions about their 2020 budgets and so it's good timing to point it out. Now again, this is essentially making an empirical point. It's not our role to set fiscal policy. It's just the empirical point that under these conditions - if you're facing a slowdown… It's a differentiated message - saying to governments facing the slowdown and that have fiscal space in this world: the fiscal multiplier is probably quite high, given the flat interest rate environment. We are also saying: where there are still fiscal targets to meet, countries continue to need to be prudent and to maintain their structural targets. Now of course, structural targets allow automatic stabilisers to work around those. So we think this message should be fairly straightforward to understand, this basic statement.  It is straightforward, but of course there's also a lot of nervousness around crossing lines or further blurring of lines between fiscal and monetary policy. As far as you're concerned, in the most recent statements and what you've just said, has the ECB gone as far as it can go on the spectrum between encouraging expansionary fiscal policy and explicitly underwriting it, if you like – which people would be very nervous about, potentially? Legally, do you think you could go any further in terms of specificity?  Lane: I'm not so sure that's the way I would think about it. I don't think I've been in and had such kind of a conversation in the ECB. It's basically a reminder of the situation, which is: we have a weak economic outlook; we are responding to that. But the mapping of our measures to the overall economy and to inflation does depend on what's going to happen and the decisions made in terms of setting fiscal policy now. I don't think it's anything like a deep philosophical issue. Of course, there's lots of debates going on in the world about monetary-fiscal interactions. It's much more confined than that.  I'm dying to ask more but I know there's lots of frustrated people wanting to ask questions! I'll take a few.    Question 1) You've done ten basis points of rate cuts. You've done €20 billion of QE. That's in the context of 350 to 500 basis points of rate cuts and €2.6 trillion of QE. Some people might argue that's tinkering at the edges. If this didn't work and it didn't prove to be the panacea, what new tool might you add to your monetary toolbox?   Question 2) You have made a big point now and also in the   Helsinki speech   about the negative rates being important because you have to have a symmetry of expectations. Since last week, the market has very strongly repriced the expectation of the effective lower bound. Is this a concern; that effectively the market seems to have concluded that really it will not go much lower than that, hence it's not so symmetric anymore?   Question 3) Just a very short one. This is just a quick clarification question: in the past statement and your speech, you say net asset purchases also continue to run before you start raising the key ECB policy interest rates. Now, that's a plural; interest rates, so does that mean it will be the point at which you raise both the depo and the MRO rate? Or is it just the depo rate until the asset purchase will run?   Question 4) A question on, there is a slight contrast in the guidance on rates and QE and the guidance on rates explicitly allows for cutting rates further. The guidance on QE doesn't mention the potential for upping the pace of asset purchases. Does that imply that the hurdle to increasing that pace as you have done in the past is quite high this time around?  Lane: To the last point, I'm pretty sure in the statement, the generic couple of sentences saying we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments as needed. So you're over-reading, I think. Equally, you're over-reading, I think [on question 3]. Remember now we have a TLTRO rate as well. So when we think about the multiplicity of rates, you have many different rates. So it's just seen as correct English to say the key ECB interest rates – it's not some encoded signal about the MRO. The whole question of how we think about the market reacting to our policy moves in turn begs the question: how do we think about the run-up to the meeting? How do we think that policy rates move beforehand? I don't particularly think we're like that. Obviously, next time we have the possibility to look and review. Trying to calibrate exactly - these are market-determined rates - so trying to exactly hit some perfect yield curve is not how we think about it. So I am not overly tracking the short-term movements you mentioned. Because I would like to conclude that what we saw before the meeting, already the ten days before the meeting, there'd been quite a lot of movement.  So to us, it's really… I tell you how the forecast process works, is essentially all of this converts into an overall picture. The big impact on the forecast is through lending rates. So we'd be looking at where are lending rates to the real economy? How are they responding to what's happened? That's really a big driver of the macro-forecast for the outlook of inflation. I know people in the market have a concern about all of these different segments, but I'm not overly concerned. What we do - so as policymakers, as the Governing Council - we're focussed on what is the toolbox relevant for today. Like any central bank, plenty of research is going on, on everything. Plenty of studying, everything that's happened elsewhere, everything that could happen. So there's no shortage of study about alternatives, and going back as you know, we're clear: our mandate is not sometimes you should hit the target delivering your mandate and sometimes you shouldn't. We have an absolute mandate.  Question 5If you could elaborate a little bit more on the issue of symmetry, because first of all I notice in the last statement it wasn't as prominent in the one before.    Secondly, you said earlier that symmetry refers to a determination on both sides of the inflation goal or inflation aim. When you read Mario Draghi's Sintra speech, I think we could even read a time element in it, so if inflation is below the target for quite a long period of time, it could probably be above it also for quite some time.   Question 6) I have a question about the leadership and whether this policy that seems designed to tie Christine Lagarde into a continuation of QE when she comes in and also potentially how you will look to work with her, obviously with her experience as well.   Question 7) I had a quick question regarding the limits on bond holdings around PSPP in particular. You've gone with the €20 billion per month option, which is actually an option that is, as you mentioned, feasible in the long run without increasing the limits. You have really mentioned this potentially change now at the last press conference. Does it mean you have given up on it; it's no longer legally feasible, in your opinion?  Lane: Okay, the first question, symmetry. I think one element is defining symmetry and the way we communicate about this – i.e. policy - really basically we will be as reactive below the inflation aim as we would be above. So it's basically saying the size of the reaction is the same, whether we're below target or above target, which I think needed clarifying, because given the price stability definition is zero to two, we kept on seeing people interpreting our inflation aim as asymmetric, because they confounded the aim, which was below but close to 2%, with interpreting some kind of hard ceiling there, too, which is not the case. Now, how do you communicate that? How do you convey that? How do you make sure everyone understands that? So in the Sintra speech Mario Draghi gave the example of one way he could do that is through overruns to match previous underruns and that's also in the Fed review now. There's a lot of interest in make-up strategies and so on. As President Draghi said last week, I'd imagine it's quite likely we'll get a strategy review at some point. That's a kind of question about, how do you communicate and deliver that symmetry? What kind of measures would you use? The prominence in the statement I think is a relevant issue. We had a lot to pack in last week, while in the statement in July there were no policy moves. So symmetry is very important. Of course, we had many things get covered in the statement last week. The Governing Council, this year – I might be wrong – but I think someone told me out of 25, there's 13 turning over this year, so there's a lot of turnover. The Governing Council has to operate on a continuous basis. Even without last week's decision, because forward guidance is a big part of the machinery, because we have a big stock of accumulated assets, any new President is going to inherit a policy position. So I'm not so sure, and I know it should be well understood that, of course, the President has a key role, but in the end the Governing Council operates as a membership between equals, and I would share with everyone else looking forward to working with Christine Lagarde. I think she's going to be an excellent President of the ECB. On the limits, again going back to: you make decisions when they are salient; and there's a decision that we assessed. Given the situation that I think applies, the €20 billion would be a good number; and because our calculations mean it doesn't cause an issue with the limits for an extended period of time, there's no particular reason to address that issue now. As you know, it's an ongoing tension between… there's very good reasons to that limit. On the other hand, if it interferes with the delivery of price stability then you'd have to look at that, but it's not immediately relevant for us. We think this - the €20 billion - can be handled within limits for an extended period of time. We think it's enough to lift the pathway for inflation.  As you know, there's lots of different estimates going around. When you say extended period of time, as far as you're concerned that's well over 18 months?  Lane: I'm quite reluctant to… – again because it goes back to everyone's opinion about how much debt is going through the mix between sovereign and non-sovereign elements with the programme. So I think we're happy enough that for an extended period of time, it is quite a long time, we can buy. I have read some people in this room write only a short period of time, which I would disagree with. Extended.  You know who you are! We promised we'd finish actually rather earlier than this, but I think it's been great to have such clarity on the policy introduced last week. I guess I've got a final question, which is: have you spoken to Christine Lagarde about monetary policy since she was appointed, or ever, for that matter?  Lane: We've had discussions in the past, when she was head of the IMF and I was governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, but not recently, no.  Do you see a process where you'll be talking to her more before she comes in?  Lane: Sure. I imagine now that she's finished with her duties at the IMF, the typical routine, for me, there was the lead-in for the month before I started in June. There was a kind of gradual greater involvement in the process and so on. So I would imagine in the coming weeks - especially as the handover looms on the horizon - that there'll be a much greater interaction.  I'm sorry that we've begun, and I'm going to end, with what you might consider to be a superficial question about how the Council handles itself, but the people in this room, the era of Peter Praet and Mario Draghi was quite a distinctive one. There was a perception that they were joined at the hip, if you like. Very strong relationship, which then drove policy in a very significant way. When you're looking at that as a potential model for your relationship with the new President, just as an observational matter do you think that's in principle a good model to follow? Or do you think there were potentially – it was very specific to the circumstances and the potential institutional cost to it? How do you think it's going to go?  Lane: I think I would count myself, and remember also as Executive Board members we are collectively responsible for the ECB. We have a lot of fantastic staff working for us and they're working for the Board collectively. I happen to have the lead responsibility for economics and monetary policy, but absolutely I can only imagine scenarios where in any scenario, the person holding my position and the President will always work in a close working relationship.  I should say, Peter Praet was also admirable, at least from our perspective, of the transparency with which he talked to journalists and to economists. I hope this is the beginning of continuing that tradition. Thank you very much for the event.    "
2019-08-30,Sabine Lautenschläger,Interview with Market News,"Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 28 August, and published on 30 August 2019","  Interview with Market News   Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 28 August, and published on 30 August 2019  The account of last month’s monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council showed the ECB has become more pessimistic in its assessment of the eurozone growth and inflation outlook over the longer term, to the extent that the baseline growth scenario may need to be revised. How worried are you?   There is, indeed, some increasing uncertainty based in particular on political shocks such as the trade tensions and Brexit. Also in Germany there is a downward trend in the manufacturing sector. But we also see signals of strengths in the euro area, for instance positive trends in the labour market and a resilience of the overall domestic growth.   The account appears to suggest - or at least I took from it - that a majority of members in the Governing Council do favour the introduction of a package of measures, such as a combination of rate cuts, asset purchases and tiering, rather than a selective sequence of options. Would that be your preference?  In my opinion, based on the current data, it is much too early for a huge package.  And I am still convinced that the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) is the ultima ratio, and it should only be used if you have a risk of deflation; and the risk of deflation is nowhere to be seen now.  Furthermore, I am concerned about setting the wrong incentives for governments if we were to re-start the APP and buy further government bonds. What is needed are structural reforms to foster sustainable growth.  And you always have to ask yourself what kind of impact restarting the APP would bring. We are already in negative yield territory for many government bonds.  We also need to consider how big the purchase universe is when keeping the current purchase limits. And keeping the limits is for me of utmost importance to address the risk of monetary financing.   There has been a lot in ECB communications of late, and elsewhere, about the perceived need for fiscal authorities to do their part to boost growth and inflation. Do you think there is a trade-off between convincing certain governments to provide fiscal stimulus and the ECB embarking on deeper negative interest rates? Equally, if there is to be an interest rate cut on September 12, does it follow that there has to be tiering in order to gain support for such a measure?  We are not the only game in town, and we should not be. Let me repeat the need for structural reforms. This is necessary for sustainable growth, and would give a boost to the competitiveness of many countries in the euro area. Using fiscal space is another possibility for some countries.  Rate cuts are part of standard monetary policy tools, so it’s something that you should certainly think about before you consider non-standard measures like APP. But overall, we have to assess whether these instruments are needed to support the transmission channel and what kind of impact and side effects they would have.  But first, I would like to see the September data and whether additional measures are needed to maintain price stability in the medium term. I would also like to assess what kind of impact these measures could have. Let us not forget that we already have a very accommodative monetary policy. Lending to households and firms is still high, according to the July figures; investments are still ongoing in spite of the uncertainties.   Do you have a view on how low into negative territory the ECB can go?  We need more analysis on what kind of impact and costs and benefits rate cuts would have. We need to look at potential side effects, for instance when would bank customers start to keep cash at home?  And you asked about tiering. Well, for this we need more analysis too. What is the net burden on banks and are mitigating measures necessary? The banks always bring up the gross burden, but they also benefit from the negative interest rate. So we have to consider all aspects before taking a decision.  Would you support more closely linking the state-dependent leg of forward guidance to inflation expectations? To plot a more explicit rate path should certain inflation conditions be met at a given point in time.  I’m sceptical to link forward guidance solely to inflation expectations.   Could you envisage circumstances in which existing TLTROs could be repriced, in order to make them more attractive to banks?  That might be, yes. We can use different tools: a change in forward guidance, TLTRO, rate cuts, the mitigating measures for rate cuts, depending on whether the data shows a need for them, their impact, costs and benefits. But overall, I don’t see the need for a huge package.  Recent ECB communications have consistently stressed that the medium term target inflation rate of below but close-to 2% is, and has always been, symmetric….  For me it’s asymmetric as the Governing Council has defined price stability as an inflation rate of below 2 % over the medium term, while our inflation aim is defined as close to but below 2%. A change should not be done hastily but based on a holistic discussion about our monetary policy strategy. Do I think that it needs to be changed? I’m not sure.  Larry Summers recently argued that when it comes to central banks, “what is needed are admissions of impotence in order to spur efforts by governments to promote demand through fiscal policies and other means.” Is it accurate to say the ECB is impotent?  We are not without power. But it is very clear, too, that we operate in an environment that is also influenced by other actors and not solely by us. Other stakeholders have to do their work too.  Were a decision taken by the Governing Council, perhaps against your better judgement, to restart APP, how long might it run for, and what level of purchases might we be looking at?  Again, I do not see a need for a re-start.   I was talking to someone the other day who said that a rate cut of 10 or 20bps is far less important than the forward guidance...  I could agree.    "
2019-07-09,Philip R. Lane,Q&A on Twitter,"Interview on Twitter with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 9 July 2019","  Q&A on Twitter   Interview on Twitter with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 9 July 2019  Congrats Mr. Lane! We wish you all the success and the best in your new Duty.  Lane: Thank you, I am very happy to be here at the ECB. I’m liking Frankfurt so far and I’m sure that I’ll continue to enjoy it #AskECB    #AskECB   Hello, Mr Lane, it seems that market is confident that ECB will cut interest rate and restart the QE, what‘s your view on the stimulus package?  Lane: We meet every six weeks to discuss monetary policy and take decisions. We continuously assess the state of the economy and stand ready to act to keep inflation on a path to our aim #AskECB    #askECB   Do all the ECB macro models of inflation rely on the Phillips curve? If not, what do you use instead (perhaps a Philips curve *:)? Also and related, are you confident that macro models include the finance sector in a useful way?  Lane: The Phillips Curve is a useful framework : it combines the dual influences of activity levels and inflation expectations in determining inflation outcomes. At the ECB, we look at many specifications of the Phillips Curve, rather than rely on a single version. #AskECB    #askecb   euro area unemployment is falling fast and service indicators point to strong employment growth in q2. Wage growth is rising helping consumption. Growth was strong in q1. Export to China and US is still rising. House prices are going up. Credit up. Why rate cuts?  Lane: While the euro area is doing well along some dimensions, inflation remains below target and there are downside risks to the growth outlook. Substantial accommodation is still required to bring inflation back to aim. If more easing is needed, we have the tools #AskECB    #AskECB   Doesn’t extremy accomodative policy create problems in the future (eg asset bubbles; lower returns for future pensioneers)? Doesn’t it provide room for governments to postpone structural reforms? Doesn’t it push up savings rate and depress demand?  Lane: Our policies support higher consumption and investment, even if there are differences across households and firms. Financial stability risks should be primarily addressed through macroprudential policies. The European Semester monitors fiscal and reform efforts #AskECB    #AskECB   Doesn't negative interest rates combined with inflation greater than 1% lower consumer spending because people have to save more for retirement?  Lane: While some households may save more, others will avail of low rates to increase consumption and household investment (home renovations etc.) #AskECB   Does the continuation of negative rates (and inflation consistently below target) suggest that the Eurozone is entering a definitive “Japanification” era?   #AskECB   Lane: Pro-active measures (including negative rates) are the surest way to ensure inflation climbs to our aim: a temporary period of negative rates is the pathway to positive rates in the future. #AskECB   Is the slowdown moving towards recession or it will be reversed?   #AskECB   Lane: We do not see a recession, although the prolongation of uncertainties is weighing on our growth outlook #AskECB    #AskECB   Now that Facebook is launching its own cryptocurrency, what are your further plans for the regulation of cryptocurrencies?  Lane: Benoît Cœuré, my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board, leads the G7 working group on stablecoins. The group will present its initial findings on 17 July #AskECB    #askecb   Due to technological advances/robotics/automation, cost of manufacturing/sevices will continue to decline in the long-term. With above, is the old era idea of inflation/inflation targetting still relevant? Or is (lack of) inflation now a convenient excuse for more QE?  Lane: It has always been the case that technological progress is associated with a trend increase in the relative price of services compared to manufacturing. Such relative price movements are not new and do not change the economics of inflation #AskECB    #AskECB   which EU banks are using TIPS  Lane: You’ll find the list of banks participating in our instant payments system here https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/tips/facts/html/index.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Do you think Structured CryptoCurrency Investments - Debt guaranteed securities, offered by Investment banks, linked to CryptoCurrency indices, hedged with cryptocurrency futures, are a credible way to invest in the crypto-payment space?   @centralbank_ie   Lane: We are not here to give investment advice – remember, you invest at your own risk. By the way, it is a high hurdle for a crypto-asset to satisfy the definition of a currency. More in our explainer https://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/tell-me/html/what-is-bitcoin.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   in a 2012 paper you concluded that “the alternative scenario in which the single European currency implodes is no longer unthinkable” Seven years later, would you confirm this conclusion? And what can the   #ECB   do to avoid it?  Lane: The first half of 2012 saw much debate about the future of the euro but much happened in Summer 2012, including the famous ""whatever it takes"" speech. The euro area today is much stronger. Further improvements in the architecture would be welcome. #AskECB  Lane: Here is the link to the papers https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.20.4.47 https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.26.3.49 #AskECB    #AskECB   During a period of prolonged zero/negative interest rates, does it make sense to stick with IT as the main monetary policy tool? Alternatively, the ECB could directly use injections of base money, the money supply, as an intermediate target to hit its 2% inflation goal.  Lane: While we certainly find it useful to examine monetary aggregates, shifts in money demand mean that it is not a good idea to overly focus on monetary volumes as an intermediate policy target #AskECB    #askecb   The independence of a central bank is crucial in a fiat money system. Is the   @ecb   able to act fully independent, if highly indebted member states of the European Monetary Union are dependent on the central bank keeping the interest rates artificially low?  Lane: The ECB is, and will remain, fully independent and sets its policies in pursuit of its mandate of maintaining price stability #AskECB    #AskECB   Could monetary policy include the buying of bonds from the EIB? As far as I can see this would keep the money from leaking out of the Eurozone (as happened with QE) and directly stimulate jobs and inflation. It could even explicitly target specfic areas of the EZ.  Lane: We are already buying EIB bonds, classified as supranational bonds. The supranational bond purchases amount to €230 billion. The list of eligible assets is here https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/pspp.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Congratulations Mr. Lane ! In your opinion, is the low interest rate context a hindrance to restoring counter-cyclical buffers in case of future severe economic downturn ?   @ecb   Lane: The counter-cyclical (CCyB) is an important tool that can help avoid a credit squeeze in a future downturn. By raising the CCyB in good times, it can be reduced if there is a negative shock in the future. #AskECB    #AskECB   There is a growing discussion about   #MMT  . What do you think about?   #ECB   Lane: The links between monetary and fiscal policy have been much studied over many years. Just to be clear – monetary financing is prohibited by the EU Treaty #AskECB   Is the ECB's primary easing tool rate cuts at this point? The message has gotten rather blurred as the discussion of raising QE issue limits seems to have taken precedence in the market.   #AskECB   Lane: We have a variety of tools in our kit. When we need to use them, we will choose the one most suitable for the situation #AskECB   Does ECB have plans to add   #Bitcoin   to its reserves?   #AskECB   Lane: No. Bitcoin is not a currency, it rather is an asset and it is very volatile #AskECB    #AskECB   does the ECB plan on doing something to effectively help Eurozone Banks consolidation and will the ECB help to pave the way for some profitability relief in the medium term?   @ecb   Lane: Banking union and the creation of a level playing field - including a key role for the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) - provide important support for a more efficient pan-European banking system. #AskECB    #AskECB   In the backdrop of   #EU     #Economy  's   #Growth   disparities/Concerns &   #Financial   Sector/  #Monetary     #Policy   related issues, besides   #Brexit   related matters - wondering, if   #ECB  's adequately prepared w/Contingency Plans - to better navigate the (future) Challenges?  Lane: Yes, we are prepared and ready to act if needed to keep inflation on track towards our aim. We certainly have the tools and we have a good performance record in responding to various sources of risks. Our policies are most effective if other actors do their part #AskECB    #AskECB   after 7 years of wrong forecasts and monetary madness have you any clue of what are you doing?  Lane: Since 2014, our policies have been successful in eliminating deflation risk and fostering strong recovery in employment in Europe. Financial stability risks remain contained. Our focus is on returning inflation to our aim #AskECB   Why are you floating the idea of more QE when €3 trillion failed to boost the economy last time and only widened the wealth gap?   #AskECB   Lane: Our asset purchases have been very successful by lowering financing conditions for firms and households and have led to the creation of millions of new jobs over recent years. #AskECB   so   #AskECB  ....what do you really think of Lagarde replacing Draghi?  Lane: She is an excellent choice for the ECB. I am very much looking forward to working with her. #AskECB    #AskECB   Are you measuring the risks and side-effects of your proposed policies? Is it prudent to make risk assessments public when considering easing measures? Would publication expose the weaknesses of EU fiscal and integration policies and pressure EU leaders?  Lane: We are constantly assessing the risks and side effects of our policies. We are transparent on this: please take a look at the accounts of Governing Council meetings https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2019/html/index.en.html #AskECB    #askecb   Bad data is now met with postive uptick in stocks and risk assets. Is this not symptomatic of the dangerous environment created by QE where participants now believe CB's will keep on providing them with cheap liquidity? Is the ECB now forever beholden to stock mkts?  Lane: Our goal is not to make markets happy, but rather to provide favourable financing conditions that can stimulate the real economy and anchor inflation expectations #AskECB    #AskECB   The   #Eurozone   is not an optimal currency area. Which are the necessary steps to become one? Is there a role for the   #ECB   in this process?  Lane: The optimal currency area (OCA) concept is very useful - but does not provide a precise roadmap. I would highlight the roles of macroprudential policies, banking and capital markets union and an effective fiscal framework. #AskECB    #AskECB   will Euro banknotes ever have elements like the Braille system?  Lane: Euro banknotes already do: they come in different sizes - the higher the value, the bigger the banknote, for example. See here for more features for the visually impaired: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/visually/html/index.en.html #AskECB   What’s your favourite bird of prey and/or peace?   #AskECB   Lane: Definitely the liver bird #LiverpoolFC #youllneverwalkalone #LFC #AskECB    "
2019-07-08,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with BFM Business TV,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Hedwige Chevrillon, published on 9 July 2019","  Interview with BFM Business TV   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Hedwige Chevrillon, published on 9 July 2019  Mr Cœuré, your name has frequently been mentioned in recent days, and the European Central Bank (ECB) has been very much in the news, with the proposed appointment of Christine Lagarde as President of the ECB. Your name had been mentioned – do you understand the reasons for the choice that was made?  It’s an excellent choice. It’s an excellent choice because Christine Lagarde’s career, first in France and then at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, makes her eminently qualified to be President of the ECB.  In what way?  She understands perfectly how the global economy works, and how the euro area economy works; she knows how to speak to the financial markets; she knows the institutional set-up in the euro area. So she will do an extremely good job.  There are many economists here in Aix. You are a distinguished economist with a fine reputation. It has been pointed out, with some justification, that Christine Lagarde doesn’t have a technical background in economics, or in monetary policy. Do we need to worry about the future of monetary policy in Europe?  No. It’s a criticism that has been made of Christine Lagarde, but she knows the economy very well – she has led the IMF, she has been finance minister, so she knows how the economy works. In addition, she will have, a team of excellent ECB economists who will work alongside her and advise her, and she will manage things very well.  Yes, but the first one of you – and that would be you, Mr Cœuré – you may, for legal reasons, for reasons of nationality, end up leaving the ECB. This is worrying a lot of people, I won’t hide it from you, even people here, who are saying that if Benoit Cœuré were to leave, having been one of the main architects of the current monetary policy framework, that would leave a huge void at the ECB.  I’ll be leaving the ECB on 31 December 2019 because that’s when my eight-year term comes to an end. Irrespective of Christine Lagarde’s appointment, I’ll be staying until the end of December, until the end of my term. The ECB’s chief economist, my colleague Philip Lane – who was previously Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland – is an excellent macroeconomist and he will be able to steer things extremely well.  Isn’t the biggest challenge the question of the team, the future team surrounding Christine Lagarde?   It’s a challenge that everyone faces when they take on a new role, of course. But she will make good decisions.  As you said yourself, you’re going to be leaving the ECB. Are you a candidate to become Managing Director of the IMF?  No, I’m not a candidate for the IMF. There are plenty of good candidates. Don’t ask me who my preferred candidate would be, because the decision is not up to me. My speciality is Europe, and so I’d rather stay in Europe and continue to serve Europe. The way in which I do so remains to be seen; there are various ways. But I’m not a candidate for the IMF.  Listening to the statements made by Mario Draghi, one has the impression that he is inclined to continue the ECB’s current interest rate policy, meaning a policy of very low interest rates. That policy is giving rise to considerable side effects, which we will discuss. Do you think this policy will be in place for a long time?  It’s a policy that has side effects, and this is something that we are monitoring. We are aware of the side effects, but our policy is necessary. Why is that? It’s because our objective is to ensure that inflation comes back to our objective which is close to, but below 2%, and we’re not there yet. So, monetary policy needs to be accommodative until that objective is met.  But what if there is deflation with this interest rate policy?   It’s a policy which has created tens of millions of jobs in the euro area, which is supporting activity and thus a return of inflation towards 2%, and which is all the more necessary right now, when we are facing a slowdown in the global economy and significant global risks – which are not related to Europe, but rather to trade tensions caused by various countries, and which are affecting confidence. In this environment, an accommodative monetary policy is needed more than ever. The Governing Council of the ECB has said that we are ready to act if new downside risks materialise. So, the policy is necessary to fulfil our mandate.  But what monetary tools do you have at your disposal if you do need to act?  We have used various tools up until now: the forward guidance, through which we steer monetary policy expectations; interest rates, which are very low and which we have said we would be ready to lower further still, if necessary – and I always stress “if necessary”; and the reinvestment of our securities portfolio, which ensures that the ECB has a very significant presence in the markets. And theoretically, we could also resume making net asset purchases, again if warranted by the circumstances.  But what are the circumstances? There are lots of questions about the circumstances. Is it the growth rate? The rate of inflation? A lack of inflation? I used something of a dirty word before when I referred to deflation. I apologise for that, but at the same time, isn’t it a kind of sword of Damocles hanging over you?  There is no deflation in the euro area; we are not talking about a risk of deflation. Inflation is well above zero. The risk is that a series of negative shocks might move us further away from our objective of 2% – that is what we are looking at, what we are trying to understand, particularly in the light of the global economy.  What some people are worried about – and we talk about a lot here – is the possibility of a financial crisis, even a financial explosion, whether in the short or medium term I don’t know. Maybe you will give us a time scale. Is there a risk of the bubble bursting or a liquidity crisis on the horizon?  There are always risks in the financial sector, and as central bankers we are paid to worry about them. The role of central bankers and regulators is to worry about risks. Our first conclusion is that we have to maintain and protect the system of financial regulation that has been built since the great financial crisis, since 2007-08. As time goes by, people are tending to forget this crisis, and the temptation returns – particularly under the pressure of different lobby groups – to relax financial regulation. This temptation must be resisted, both in terms of banking and finance more generally.  Then we have to identify the new risks. I see two main risks; there are many but I would like to highlight two of them. First, we have the risk that part of the financial sector slips out of the domain of banks and into the domain of non-banks.  That’s already the case...  Yes, it’s already the case. The size of banks is now under control; the large banks are handling risk much better than they were before the crisis. But the price to pay for that has been that part of the financial sector has moved to the domain of non-banks – investment funds, money market funds, etc. – which is regulated differently, where we don’t have the so-called macroprudential instruments, in other words, a way to control the bubbles, as one might say. These instruments barely exist, or don’t even exist at all, in the domain of market-based finance. That’s a challenge for regulators, particularly for the next cycle of European regulation over the next five years.  Do you think we need to create new regulatory instruments for this non-bank finance?  Yes, exactly. And the second risk I see – which is of a different nature – is cyber risk, the risk linked to cyber attacks. At the ECB, and elsewhere in Europe, we are paying close attention to this issue. We can’t rule out the fact that the next financial crisis may come from a cyber attack on a big financial institution or a financial infrastructure. It’s our priority to prevent this risk.  Do you think the chances of a cyber attack are quite high? It’s fairly logical given that we’re already seeing cyber attacks against companies…  Ask any company director; there are thousands of cyber attacks every day. We’re being tested all the time, including at the ECB. It’s part of being a company. But the financial system has weak points – there are systemic infrastructures that could be targeted by cyber attacks. At the ECB we’ve reacted by creating a forum – the Euro Cyber Resilience Board – which assesses the resilience of major European infrastructures. We’ve also reacted at the level of the G7, with a recent cyber crisis coordination exercise.  Has the ECB already experienced a major, significant cyber attack?  We experience thousands of small ones every day, like everyone…  So no “massive” attack?  Not for now, no. No significant attack. But it will come, and we have to be ready.  You talked about this parallel finance that is becoming increasingly important; there is also a huge amount of money flowing into private equity. Why? Because there is not enough money to be made anywhere else? Is that an amber warning light for you?  Not private equity specifically, no. But there are other areas we are monitoring at euro area level, like real estate financing, which is not a problem in general, but there are small warning signs in certain countries. There are also these so-called leveraged loans – more in the United States than in Europe – but which are starting to become a global problem. So there are a number of warning lights that are starting to flash on the global dashboard. These are signs of financial fragility and we’re keeping a close eye on them.  And when exactly will we have a financial crisis? In the relatively short term? Maybe as a central banker you can’t say…  I don’t know how to answer that question. My job is to make sure the financial system is as robust as possible. At the level of the financial institutions themselves, that’s the work of the banking supervisors, my colleagues at the ECB who supervise the banks, who check that they have enough capital and liquidity to withstand a crisis, and at the level of big global infrastructures like payment systems and clearing systems.  There is a major economic debate around the topic of “low rate policies mean we have to completely revisit our traditional macroeconomic models”. Olivier Blanchard, in particular, has been vocal, but not just him... Olivier Blanchard, the former IMF chief economist, whom you know well. Shouldn’t we revisit our macroeconomic criteria? Can’t debt help, as long as it takes the form of infrastructure investment?  I didn’t interpret Olivier Blanchard as saying that we had to radically change our economic models, quite the contrary. What he said was that, within the framework of our traditional models, there are indicators, or parameters, that have changed, especially the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate, which is very different from how it has been in the past and that, he says, warrants a policy of re-indebtedness in certain countries.  The idea is that current policy is causing countries to pursue a rather tight fiscal policy, particularly as regards the level of debt…  That does not call for a change in economic theory; it is actually in line with standard economic theory. The parameters have simply changed because interest rates are lower than before. I think he is basically right, but the analysis needs to be done for each country individually. In Europe we would need to carefully identify those countries where interest rates will be persistently low relative to growth rates. I don’t think that countries such as Italy, or even France, fall into that group. Interest rates have indeed fallen but they will climb up again one day, and long-term growth rates – potential growth rates as economists would say – are rather low. And the European Commission’s assessment, like our own at the ECB, is that there are actually very few countries in Europe with the resources to actively deploy fiscal policy. Germany is one of them but France and Italy are not.   Can we permanently have such low interest rates and no return on savings?   Yes, people are earning a lower return on their savings, but savers are employees and consumers too. And the low interest rate policy has enabled a revival in employment and a recovery in economic activity, which also boost savings.  So you don’t see a risk in this policy over the long term? Is there no systemic risk?  Our current monetary policy is designed to respond to a very specific situation, namely to a low growth, low inflation environment which should not last forever. Monetary normalisation will have to set in at some point, but the prospect of that normalisation is moving a little further away. That’s because of the risks for the global economy generated by shocks in the United States, in China and in the global trade system. So for the moment, this prospect of normalisation will need to be slightly postponed, but I am convinced that normalisation will have to occur eventually.  Yes, the question is the long term, isn’t it?   We conduct monetary policy based on the data at our disposal and we now see a slowdown in the global economy.  Another issue that’s very important because it has, and will have, a huge impact is cryptocurrencies, like the famous Libra, which will be launched by Facebook with the backing of large investors. As chair of the working group on these currencies, do you see them as a threat or, on the contrary, as an evolution of traditional currencies?  A G7 working group on stable coins, set up at the request of the French presidency, will present an initial report to the meeting of the G7 in Chantilly in around ten days’ time. Stable coins are a global topic affecting all countries, so work will also be carried out at the level of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board. I think we need a balanced approach to this question; it obviously involves many and varied dimensions of risks, which makes this debate rather complex. There are risks related to anti-money laundering, the anonymity of transactions and the use of these instruments for illicit transactions. And there are financial stability risks and risks relating to the use of the personal data that are generated by these transactions. So we need a multi-disciplinary approach and, most of all, we need a coherent approach at global level, because these are projects which have a global dimension from the outset. The difference between these new projects and the fintechs, as they are traditionally known, is that we have been looking at small projects in what are known as regulatory “sandboxes” and, now, we have an elephant entering the sandbox. That is the issue. So we need to understand what this elephant looks like.  Yes, an elephant!  We need to understand the elephant. But we also need to look at the opportunities, the advances offered by these technologies. They pose a challenge to the traditional banking system, which has not been quick enough to seize the new technologies, particularly in the field of payments.   They do more than challenge them; couldn’t they put them at risk?   Yes, but a technological innovation enabling less costly and quicker international payments is a welcome innovation. Banks need to react and adapt to it, but innovation in itself is a good thing. And it demands a response from us central banks too. Our instant payments projects at the ECB are a case in point. At the ECB we now have an instant payments system known as TIPS which is inexpensive and works extremely well. We need to learn to link these systems with our colleagues in other countries to facilitate cross-border payments. Innovation is also an incentive, a stimulus that enables us to work more effectively.   Currencies are normally minted by states. Don’t you find it shocking that a private concern is “minting currency”, so to speak?   We are not talking about currency, but rather what is known as ‘’stable coins’’.   It’s a means of payment…  They are payment systems, a means of payment as you say, but they may eventually evolve to become financial instruments, perhaps even debt or funding instruments. We will identify all these functionalities and we will have to have a regulation for each functionality such that equivalent activities are regulated in the same way, regardless of the technology behind them.  So you have no concerns about these currencies?   They are not currencies. There is only one currency in the euro area, only one which is legal tender, and that is the euro. There is no other.   Benoit Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, thank you for this interview.    "
2019-07-02,Philip R. Lane,Interview with Yle,"Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Aapo Parviainen and broadcast on 1 July 2019","  Interview with Yle   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Aapo Parviainen and broadcast on 1 July 2019  What are the alternatives to fight for the euro when recession hits the euro area next time?  What I said today at the conference is the ECB has been creative in developing a toolkit, moving the interest rate below zero, being active in purchasing government debts, special lending programmes for banks and also communicating about future policies. Taken together this has worked quite well, it’s worked quite well so far and I’m confident if there is a downturn more can be done. So if you like the main conclusion of my talk today is that we should be confident that even under these conditions the ECB has the policy measures to allow it to respond to shocks to the economy, shocks to inflation. Being a central bank is a very powerful institution, the ability to influence financial conditions is quite extensive and so we should be confident about the effectiveness of our policies at the ECB.  Do we have to accept these negative interest rates looking forward?  I think we should view this as a temporary measure. The negative interest rate allows more spending by firms, more spending by households. By allowing the European economy to grow more quickly when the economy has recovered then the interest rate will turn positive again. So not forever but for a while.  Can you give a time estimation?  It depends on what happens, as you know the world is quite uncertain, we have a baseline forecast which remains optimistic for Europe but we recognise there are downside risks.  What about inflation then? It’s far from target.  Well I think we have to take a measured approach. Compared to say 2014 there’s been a good recovery of inflation, so compared to the risk in 2014 year by year inflation is moving upwards. But as you say it’s still not yet at the objective level. So we continue to have a lot of accommodation and we have said that if there are further negative shocks, we can do more. So I think it’s important to be in the middle, inflation is recovering, we expect it to continue to recover but the job is not over.  But there is no need to change the target?  The target is, I think, not at the centre of any issue right now. At the centre right now are the shocks hitting the world economy and the importance of the ECB to respond to those shocks.  Looking at the world economy now, how big a risk is this trade war?  So I think it is important to recognise that domestically the European economy has many positives. By the way the trade war does not extend to the Single Market, most trade in the European Union, most trade for Finland, a lot of that is going to be with the other members of the European Union, which has no trade war. But unfortunately the trade war, the trade discussion between China and the United States does carry risks for the European economy and many firms here in Finland sell to Asia, to America, many firms across Europe, so the quicker this trade dispute is settled the better for the European economy.  If we take another risk – Brexit – how do you see that?  Again we have a situation now where there is a lot of uncertainty. Either we will have a Brexit that is negotiated or we have a no-deal Brexit or there are other scenarios. So I think in the coming weeks and months we’ll get some answers, this cannot go on forever. I think everyone is indicating we need to come to a conclusion and once that conclusion is reached – especially if there is a reasonable negotiation, a reasonable outcome – then uncertainty will be reduced and that can be good news. On the other hand if it’s a no-deal Brexit that will cause more disruption.  And your favourite deal is?  Well again it’s up to the politicians. As for the ECB we will just respond to whatever happens. It’s up to the political leaders of the United Kingdom to finalise Brexit.  In Finland we always compare ourselves to Sweden. When this first crisis hit Sweden they kept doing well and Finland not so well, and then comes this question of if it has been a good idea at all to be a member of Economic and Monetary Union. How do you see this?  So I’m a very big fan of the euro. I think it’s pretty important to recognise that without the ECB the crisis we had would have been worse. Imagine the crisis of those years without a powerful shared central bank. If we had had 19 separate currencies during the crisis the outcome would have been worse. Especially for small countries, the euro provides a lot of stability. I think increasingly as you know in the surveys the euro is very popular and I think that assessment by the European population is correct. It is a very good invention for Europe and I think for all of us in the euro area we should be proud of our common currency.  One personal question. You are an academic, how do you see your new position now as Chief Economist? Your position is very important in the ECB.  So I think monetary economics, central banking is very closely connected to academia. One of the reasons the Bank of Finland is having this conference today is to recognise the importance of interaction between central bank officials like myself and university professors and students. This is an area where I’ve said in the speech the ECB has to be a learning organisation, we have to learn from our own research, from the university sector, from other central banks. So actually I think this is an area where I feel coming from a university background helps me in my current job.   "
2019-06-17,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with the Financial Times,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Claire Jones on 12 June, and published on 17 June 2019","  Interview with the Financial Times   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Claire Jones on 12 June, and published on 17 June 2019  At the last ECB Governing Council in Vilnius, there seemed to be some progress in coming up with solutions to face the risks to the outlook……   The Governing Council discussion in Vilnius was about making sense of diverse signals from the economy and the financial markets. The eurozone economy is not doing so badly; in fact services and construction are doing quite well. The concerns are really around the manufacturing sector, and the source of these concerns is mostly, if not entirely, to be found outside of the eurozone and may be temporary. The signals coming from the financial markets, however, are quite alarming.  Anything in particular that alarms you?  The constellation of prices in the bond market paints a picture of the global economy which is very bleak. Central banks should never ignore market signals. They shouldn’t follow them blindly either. I’m not saying this as a reason to be complacent, but we have to make sense of this divergence between market prices and economic data.  Our baseline staff projection for the euro area economy is not so bad. And that message is something that the Governing Council is broadly comfortable with. But the distribution of risks around this projection has broadened. Risk has increased. And that required reassurance from the Council that we’re ready to address these risks, should they materialise. So far we’re talking about contingency planning. But at some point during our next few meetings, we might very well be facing a situation where risks have materialised. And the question is not whether we have instruments; we do have instruments. We can change our guidance. We can cut rates. We can restart QE. The question is which instrument, or combination of instruments, would be best suited to the circumstances. That discussion only started in Vilnius; we need to take it forward and reflect on the nature of the risks we’re facing.  Can you cut rates without tinkering with the way negative rates are applied to banks?  All options come with costs and benefits, and we have to ponder them very carefully. None of this would deter us from acting. We have a clear mandate and will act on our mandate. So, if the conclusion were that cutting rates is the best option, then we would have to consider the impact of negative rates on financial intermediation, especially for banks. We would have to consider whether a tiering system is needed. Today the prevailing view in the Governing Council is that it is not, but we also agree that it deserves further reflection.  Markets have got ahead of you. A lot of people are already pricing in a rate cut. A lot of people are already thinking that the guidance that rates are expected to remain on hold for the first half of 2020 is out-of-date, even though you’ve moved it forward only last week. Does that not blunt two out of three of the policy options you’ve mentioned?  I would like to challenge the view that our guidance has to be aligned with the market at any given point in time. If that were the case, then it would not be needed in the first place. The guidance is a way to filter the view of the Governing Council on future economic developments and doesn’t have to coincide with market expectations.  But in terms of your capacity to surprise, to really get ahead of markets, that’s a bit limited…  Whatever the instrument, we’ll calibrate it to what’s needed for the eurozone economy.  Some people have the idea that the issue limit on the proportion of a member state’s bonds you can buy of a third of all the outstanding stock is not as hard as people might have thought in the past. Would you agree with that?  The European Court of Justice has stressed the relevance and usefulness of limits. The limits are there to guard against monetary financing and to protect the price discovery process. On the other hand, the ECJ has also affirmed the principle that we should have broad discretion in designing our instruments. The limits are ours. We already have some degree of freedom across securities. For instance, we already buy up to 50 per cent of supranational bonds, while for individual sovereigns the limit is lower. I’m not saying that’s the way to go, but a more detailed discussion is possible if warranted by our price stability objective. We’ve been very serious about these requirements since we started QE and if we were to restart it, we would have the discussion again in a serious and responsible way.  Some believe that if you have more action from the ECB, you might need more fiscal spending as well…  We have a mandate to fulfil, and we will do what is necessary to fulfil it. There is no quid pro quo between the ECB and governments, and we are not going to threaten them. We all have a job to do. But imagine that if the eurozone were hit by a particularly adverse negative shock, then lack of action on fiscal policy in those countries which can use it would require a stronger monetary policy reaction. And a stronger monetary policy reaction would magnify the potential downsides of rates being low for long.  Does the ECB need to follow the Fed’s lead and review its monetary policy strategy, in particular its inflation objective?  I tend to think that we have more urgent issues to face right now, but I’m pretty sure that we’ll do it at some point nevertheless.  Having very substantially broadened our range of monetary policy instruments, and having learnt a lot from the crisis, I expect that, at some point, we’ll have to take stock of that experience and review our monetary policy strategy, whoever is the next president. But I would advise against doing so in a piecemeal way. The definition of price stability is an important dimension, of course, but it is not the only one. You also need to ask yourself which instruments have worked well and which have worked less well. You need to reflect on the structural changes in our economy – technology, globalisation, servicification – that have kept us away from our targets. Looking forward, maybe climate change will be another important thing to look at, too.  What’s your thinking on how the ECB has changed over the past eight years?  It’s a long journey that goes back more than eight years. And the ECB has always been its own beast, even when it started back in 1998. It was never designed to be exactly like the Bundesbank, but it’s true that, since then, it has borrowed features from the Fed.  And we’ve certainly abandoned the small, open economy mindset which was the one of most participants back then.  We’ve also learnt the hard way that Economic and Monetary Union is much more fragile as a construct than initially thought. And that the job of the ECB is not only about setting prices and quantities for monetary aggregates across the eurozone, but also about dealing with some of the flaws and imperfections that hamper monetary policy transmission. We’ve had to look under the bonnet and find out how all parts of the engine work. But let me add that the challenges for the next eight years could be substantially different, and could be even more daunting.   What do you think the key challenges are going to be for the next president?  Let me outline four main challenges. First, global cooperation is eroding. The capacity of global policymakers to deal with shocks to the global economy is today less than it was previously. The kind of coordinated action that we saw back in 2008 would be more difficult to achieve today. I’m not saying it would be impossible, but it would be more difficult.  Second, the eurozone’s structural weaknesses, its lingering fragilities, are not going to go away soon. I’m not dismissing all the good work being done in Brussels and other places to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism and to complete banking union, which is something that we didn’t have eight years ago, and that’s clear progress. But we’re still only half way. And as long as this journey is not completed, new crises will inevitably come, and we have to stand ready to ride out those crises. Third, as the ECB, we do have instruments, and we’ve shown that we’re ready to use them and even design new ones while staying within our mandate. But the cost of using any given instrument might be increasing, which makes the trade-offs more acute. Let me give an example. Rates being low for long may eventually create financial stability risks. So far, they’ve been limited, scattered around the continent, around sectors, around jurisdictions, and they could be addressed using targeted macroprudential instruments. But most of these macroprudential instruments are about addressing risk in the housing sector; there is little they can do today about risks in the corporate sector, or in shadow banking. And finally, there are mounting challenges to our independence. The world today is different from the one we faced in 2011 or 2012. There is widespread mistrust of experts, and what are central bankers if not experts? European politics is much more fragmented, both within countries and at the European level, than it was eight years ago, and that has been evidenced by the latest European election. The temptation to either overburden central banks with a variety of objectives which politicians cannot achieve, or blame them for political failures, will be greater, and that’s something we’ll have to live with. Monetary policy is difficult to understand. And because money creation is something that captures attention and fascinates, expectations of the ECB can also be too high. But there are things that we just can’t do. And there are things that we could do, but should not do, because they are political in nature. I’m convinced that our narrow price stability mandate has served us very well and has protected us from politicisation. A broad mandate is something that we would not be well equipped to manage, because we are not a political institution. The conclusion is that we will have to safeguard and defend our independence more strongly than we have had to over the last eight years, at ECB level and at the level of national central banks.  So what would be the right credentials for the next president to have, with those challenges in mind?  It’s a decision for European leaders and European finance ministers to take. But there are common credentials for any central bank governor. For example, part of the job profile is to understand markets. Because, like it or not, we have to understand what markets are telling us. We don’t always have to agree. But we have to understand the language they speak. Also, you need to understand the political environment – because you have to be able to uphold your independence, and because monetary policy is not the only game in town and in many cases needs supporting action. If you want to see the fiscal response or regulatory response that will help monetary policy, you need the ability to talk to political leaders, respecting our different mandates. And finally, good economics never harm.   How do you make the public more aware of what the central bank can and cannot do?  First, you need to explain what you’re doing, and there are certainly many ways we can do it better. This is an area where central banks can learn from each other. For instance, what the Bank of England has been reflecting on in terms of using plain language, trying to resist using arcane, academic language when talking to citizens, is something we could make good use of. It’s even more important for the ECB to be active reaching out to people. Being a European institution in a tower in Frankfurt, we can seem even further away. It’s a big challenge. Frédéric Bastiat, the French economist from the 1840s, wrote a wonderful book which is titled “Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas”, “What you see and what you don’t see”. Monetary policy works by trickling down first to the banks and the financial system and then on to the whole of the economy. So people see the direct impact – unemployed workers will see that we’re lifting stock prices, banks will see that we’re shrinking their interest margin. They don’t see the indirect impact – jobs being created, wages being lifted thanks to higher consumption and investment – and that’s what we have to do a better job of explaining.  One of the big problems of the euro is that it hasn’t produced as much economic integration as you would have thought. How do you address that?  That’s true. We need more integration and we need more convergence. Which is why the budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness that has been agreed by the Eurogroup is a useful step, although it should evolve over time to include counter cyclical features.   What do you think of the involvement of the ECB in the troika that designed and imposed the Greek bailout programmes? Would you defend it as the right decision?  The ECB’s involvement in the troika was a symptom of one of the many flaws in the eurozone as it was set up. Being in the troika was not the right place for a central bank. But back in 2010, the institutional framework was highly deficient, and the only way to gather and aggregate the relevant expertise was to bring together the Commission, the IMF and the ECB. The ECB was asked to do it and did it as a service to European governments. I don’t think we could have escaped from playing that role and we played it in an honest and professional way. Now, the institutional framework has improved, we have a new arrangement emerging between the Commission and the European Stability Mechanism, and ECB involvement is much less vital than it was in 2010. We’ve already scaled down our involvement; for some time now in Greece, we’ve been focusing on financial sector issues, where our expertise is clear, and on broad fiscal topics. We wouldn’t take a view on the structure of taxes, or on reforming public administration, or on social benefits, as we have done in the past.  How do you feel about the political will for more integration, after the European elections?  As a citizen, I want to pick out the good signs from the European elections, in particular the renewed focus on the environment and climate change. Now, focusing more narrowly on the single currency and monetary union, that discussion was largely absent from the electoral campaign, in all countries. And that’s a lost opportunity. What remains to be done to complete Economic and Monetary Union is profoundly political. It’s not a technical discussion. It’s about the appropriate degree of solidarity and of discipline that is needed to make the eurozone more resilient and protect it in times of crisis, and that is highly political. And you would need a broad discussion around it; ideally a pan-European one. Ultimately the problem is that while European citizens see the benefits of the euro as a currency and all want to keep it, they are not ready to accept the constraints on national economic policies that come with membership of the Monetary Union. And that has to be explained: you cannot be a free rider in a monetary union; you need to have the right policies at home and in Brussels. The European elections could have been the right time to have the discussion. But it didn’t happen, and misunderstandings and misgivings will stay with us. This creates a lingering fragility.  How involved should central banks be in combating climate change?  Climate change is a defining issue for the global economy. No one can ignore it, certainly not central bankers. We cannot be blind and deaf to the discussion. We need to understand how climate change will shape the economy. The time horizon has shortened. Climate change used to be envisaged as a very long-term issue, but it is not anymore; some of the consequences are already visible today. As a result, it becomes relevant for macroeconomic policy-making. The discussion about the links between financial stability and climate change has started already. Mark Carney has played a leading role in that discussion, in the Financial Stability Board and in the G20. Considerations such as the carbon footprint of our pension and own funds portfolios can be– and often already are – taken into account. The discussion is now increasingly shifting to monetary policy. There, we have to be much more cautious: we have a clear price stability mandate, and everything we can do to combat climate change has to be assessed against it.   "
2019-06-15,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Corriere della Sera,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini on 13 June 2019","  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini on 13 June 2019  The 5y5y forward inflation rate is at an all-time low and clearly below where it was when Mario Draghi first hinted at quantitative easing (QE) in 2014. The ECB has already done some more easing and President Draghi himself mentioned that there was an interesting discussion at the latest Governing Council meeting on different tools to do some more easing – the asset purchase programme (APP) and others. What do you need to see in order to decide to do more?  What we need to see is a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. This has not yet happened, despite the fact that there has been a drop in market-based inflation expectations. If you look at the survey of professional forecasters, the situation is a little bit different – expectations have remained stable. Then we need to see if there is a significant additional drop in economic activity – a crystallisation of the downside risks that we have indicated. We can always try to look forwards to get an idea of what might happen, but ultimately the reality is the reality. And, well, let’s see what happens. But I think the important part of our stance is that we are totally ready to react. We will have time enough to know the future when it arrives.   Does that imply that the current stance is appropriate, if your staff forecasts are confirmed?  Yes. And if there is a further deterioration, then we will react. But for now, our monetary policy stance is fully compatible with both inflation and real activity. The important element is that we are totally ready to react. And I would add another element, if I may: risks are tilted to the downside.  Do you mean, in terms of real activity?  Both in terms of real activity and in terms of inflation. So if those risks materialise, then we will react.   Can you think about different monetary policy tools to address different problems? If the issue is with the exchange rate, official rates are probably the answer; if it’s real activity, then QE; if it’s monetary transmission, then it’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO)…  We do not allocate our instruments to different objectives. Something that I think is relevant, but is sometimes a bit overlooked, is that monetary policy is not almighty. If there is a problem with price stability, that’s within our mandate. But this is something everyone has to keep in mind to avoid creating expectations that will not be met: we do not have the philosopher’s stone.  Are you implying that having something of a policy mix would be good, in total respect of the ECB’s independence?  Sure. But my point is that wherever there is a problem, for instance a problem with trade disputes, that is a real economic problem that is going to have real consequences. You can certainly smooth the impact with monetary policy, but you will not be able to address and fix this kind of problems with monetary policy. The real role of monetary policy is price stability. And in order to guarantee price stability, we have to monitor the evolution of the real economy – domestic demand, external demand, the exchange rate, and the rest. But you cannot fix all the economic problems of the world with monetary policy.  President Draghi hinted recently that if there is a slowdown and those downside risks materialise, fiscal policy might also play a role.  Yes, sure. It’s the policy mix. Of course there is monetary policy, and we have been the main game in town since 2012. Monetary policy has been key to understanding the recovery of activity and employment creation, among other things. But it’s not the only policy in place. Fiscal policy has to play a role, as do structural reforms. And in the case of fiscal policy, it’s not only the nominal deficit level, it’s the composition as well: the quality of public finances.  Are you saying that the public investment-to-GDP share, which has remained flat, at 2.6%, during the QE years, could now increase?  It’s not even only public investment. One of the problems in Europe now is low productivity, which is caused by the fact that we are not investing enough in education, R&D and public infrastructure. But public infrastructure is not a stabilisation instrument. When you start building a road, for instance, the project is delivered much later, when the business cycle may have already turned. But education and R&D are levers that have to be used. And at the same time I think it’s important that we look at the composition of taxation and its impact on long-term growth and productivity.   Do you mean it would be better to have lower taxation on labour, compensated by other areas of the tax base?  It depends; there is no single recipe. But you can’t take the tax structure that we have now as a fait accompli. You should use a combination that takes into account new elements, such as climate change. All these aspects have to be taken into consideration. That is why fiscal policy is very relevant; it’s not only the nominal deficit that matters.  So when you and President Draghi go to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings, you might have concepts to share with the ministers in this respect?  Sure, when we go to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings we are fully coordinated, also on fiscal policy matters.  Italy and Spain were trading at very similar levels during the crisis. Today the Bonos-BTP spread on 10-year maturities is over 180 basis points. What do you think explains such divergence: the fiscal situation, growth rates or redenomination risk?  First, I do not want make comparisons between Spain and Italy. But focusing on Italy, I think the main problem has been very low growth. You have not recovered the level of GDP that you had in 2008.   What do you think is the reason for that?  I think there are two elements. The first is the extremely high level of public debt, which is a sword of Damocles hanging over your head. Second, there is a problem with structural reforms. But there are pros and cons in the Italian economy. The cons are slow growth, public debt, a lack of structural reforms and so low productivity growth. But Italy also has some advantages that we have to acknowledge. The first is that it has a current account surplus. The net investment position is good, and that reduces the vulnerability of the economy. And when one looks at the country’s budgetary track record, it has not been bad because it has had a primary surplus almost every year. This is not something that is very easy to achieve, so it’s a very good track record, especially when compared with other countries. So we come back to the problem of slow growth, which immediately leads us on to structural reforms, barriers to market entry, labour market efficiency… These are the kinds of things that are sometimes a little bit overlooked.   There is nothing unfair in comparing Italy to Spain in June and July 2012. The situation was very similar.  We were very close, we were on the edge…  The situation was the same and the two countries took two different paths. Spain decided to take an EU programme for the banks, whereas Italy committed itself to making it on its own. Do you think that decision explains the divergence between the two countries since then?  Again, I don’t want to make a direct comparison. The situation in Spain in 2012 was different – the government had an absolute majority in Parliament, we were lucky in that. And the clean-up of banks in Spain was far-reaching. It was not easy; it was bloody, I can assure you. But we did it and, after that, we were able to deal with an issue like Banco Popular. That was not easy, either. Then, Spain gained a lot of competiveness because of labour market reforms. Those are the two factors. But I don’t want to make a comparison with Italy. I am only focusing on Spain now. By 2013 Spain had started to grow again, and it has outperformed its peers for the last five or six years.  So do you think frontloading that effort paid off?  Yes, I think so. In Spain there was a government with an absolute majority, but even then we had a difficult time, politically speaking, after that. But in Spain, regardless of the political party in power, the pro-European approach is guaranteed, even when you look at the two extremes, Vox and Podemos.  They don’t question the euro.   Maybe they have different approaches regarding fiscal policy, but they don’t say they want to leave the euro. No, not at all.  In fact, when you look at credit default swap (CDS) markets, the implied probability of Spain leaving the euro is very, very low. In the case of Italy, it is not very low. Is it possible, then, that part of the spread between Bonos and BTPs is due to that redenomination concern for Italy?  Again, it’s not a matter of making comparisons between countries. In the case of Spain, the main reforms were labour market reforms and cleaning up the banks. Those are the drivers of Spain’s good performance, in my view. And those are the elements that have to be maintained over the coming years.   De Nederlandsche Bank President Klaas Knot recently said that divergence among euro area countries is making it increasingly difficult to set a single monetary policy that fits all of them. He expressed concerns about the sustainability of ever-diverging trends. Would you agree with him?  There are no ever-diverging trends. There is the concrete case of Italy, which is underperforming. But six or seven years ago the underperformers were Spain, Greece and Ireland, and now they are overperformers. It’s changed quite a lot. For instance, now in 2019 Germany is going to be one of the countries with a lower growth rate. And yet it was the euro area’s growth engine two or three years ago. There is not an accumulation of divergences, but situations change. Some countries that were underperforming are now overperforming, and vice versa. And this is not going to depend on monetary policy. Monetary policy has to take care of price stability and some real factors that can explain inflation levels across the euro area. But it’s exactly the same in the United States.  Do you think a single currency area can work in the long term without having a single budget to address shocks, banking problems or competiveness issues?  I think the institutional architecture of the euro area has not been finalised at all. We have made some progress with the creation of the European Stability Mechanism, and we have launched the banking union, but this project is not complete. We have to finish the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) and we need to complete the capital markets union. I am fully in favour of having an instrument with a stabilisation capacity. It can take different forms.  Of the kind French president Emmanuel Macron is proposing?  If you look at what was agreed in the European Council, it was a first step in the right direction. But that should not be the steady state of the instrument. It could grow and have a very clear purpose – countercyclical stabilisation. Now it’s more like a sort of competiveness instrument. We have to share more risk, for sure, if we want to improve the performance of the euro area and reduce the burden of monetary policy because, as I said, monetary policy is not almighty. And there is one element that is going to be key to achieving these steps: trust.  You have to trust other countries to behave. But when a country misbehaves, as seems to be the case with Italy now, are you concerned that this may hamper trust?  In the case of Italy, if you look at the fundamentals there are pros and cons. Italy is not a very vulnerable economy on financial grounds, if you take into account the net investment position and other factors. If you want an example of a vulnerable economy, look at Spain in 2010. It had an external deficit of 10% of GDP and a net investment position of 90% of GDP in the red. That’s not the situation Italy is in now. My point is that trust sometimes depends on the political intentions of the government.  You mean the Italian government must provide some clearly stated objectives that are acceptable to the rest of the club.  Yes, on both sides. This is a bilateral game, so it’s from both sides. And I think it’s very difficult to make progress if we can’t build trust. And since we are talking about trust and uncertainty in difficult times, I think this idea of discussing mini-BOTs was a mistake. President Draghi said that if it’s legal tender, it’s illegal and if it’s debt, then it piles up more debt. Also, in my view, the worst consequence of this kind of decision is that it destroys trust.   "
2019-05-31,Peter Praet,Interview met De Tijd,"Interview Peter Praet, Lid van de directie van de ECB, afgenomen door Peter de Groote en Wouter Vervenne op 22 mei en gepubliceerd op 1 juni 2019","  Interview met De Tijd   Interview Peter Praet, Lid van de directie van de ECB, afgenomen door Peter de Groote en Wouter Vervenne op 22 mei en gepubliceerd op 1 juni 2019  Het is opvallend hoe populair u hier bent, en hoeveel kritiek u soms buiten Frankfurt krijgt. Hoe tevreden bent u zelf over wat u bij de ECB bereikt hebt?   Peter Praet: 'Het mandaat van de ECB is er één van prijsstabiliteit (een inflatiedoelstelling van minder dan maar dicht bij 2 procent). Een pijnpunt blijft dat de inflatie nog altijd vrij laag is en dat we het bereiken van onze inflatiedoelstelling met de jaren almaar verder voor ons uit moeten hebben schuiven. Toch denk ik dat ons beleid een succes geweest is.'   U hanteert een aparte definitie van succes.   Praet: 'Die inschatting is controversieel, ik weet dat. Maar kijk, ook al is de inflatie nog altijd niet voldoende gestegen, uiteindelijk belanden we op die 2 procent, daar geloof ik in. Bovendien is het zeer moeilijk om te zeggen wat er gebeurd zou zijn als we het anders hadden gedaan. En je moet ook rekening houden met de schokken die er geweest zijn: de Chinezen die hun economie herbalanceren, de onzekerheid rond de wereldhandel door onder meer de Amerikaanse handelspolitiek, de brexit… Ons beleid heeft weinig vat op die schokken, en de laatste jaren krijgen we de ene na de andere.'   Hoe komt het dat u minder gedaan krijgt dan vroeger?  Praet: 'Omdat de schokken anders zijn. Monetair beleid kan helpen bij een financiële crisis of bij een tijdelijke krimp van de vraag van bedrijven en consumenten. Een laatste schok van die aard hebben we gezien in 2015-2016. Maar sindsdien zie je grote schokken die gerelateerd zijn aan een zero sum game-mentaliteit. We zien populisme en protectionisme oprukken, regeringen onstabieler worden, en soms maatregelen nemen die welvaart vernietigen. Terwijl je net het omgekeerde nodig hebt: grote coalities die pakketten hervormingen doorvoeren die de steun van de bevolking krijgen én die goed zijn voor de economie.'  Misschien moeten jullie creatiever zijn. Welke mogelijkheden heeft de ECB nog?  Praet: 'Het is voorbarig en riskant om te praten over wat we nog zouden kunnen doen. Mensen kunnen dan beginnen speculeren, en dat zou niet goed zijn. We hebben dingen gedaan, als er iets nieuws op ons bord komt proberen we daarmee om te gaan. Maar nu moet er in de eerste plaats een antwoord van de politiek komen. Wat geven mensen nog uit als ze denken dat er oorlog komt? Dan kun je de rente zo laag zetten als je wil, veel ga je niet gedaan krijgen. Let op, we praten vandaag niet echt over een echte oorlog, maar wel over een handelsoorlog. Dergelijke geopolitieke, multilaterale schokken zijn extreem problematisch en verontrustend. Als je in een protectionistische spiraal belandt, kan dat een economische ramp veroorzaken. We zijn vandaag niet op dat punt, maar overal in de eurozone zijn bedrijven hun investeringen op een lager pitje aan het zetten, de cijfers geven vandaag nog een vertekend beeld omdat de bouw nog goed draait. Maar dat is voor een stuk tijdelijk. Je kunt hopen op het beste, maar dat is en zal moeilijk zijn, denk ik.'   Waarom is een handelsoorlog zo verstorend voor de economie?   Praet: 'Onze hele industrie is georganiseerd op een extreme verdeling van arbeid over een globale voorraadketen. Als je in dat systeem rimpelingen veroorzaakt, is er een hele grote kost. Ik hoor sommige mensen zeggen dat de handelsbarrières best meevallen, maar zelfs lage tarieven die er bij komen zijn zeer destructief voor het investeringsklimaat voor bedrijven en gezinnen. Ook het klimaat dat voorligt voor de komende jaren ziet er kwalijk uit.'   Wat als deze aaneenrijging van schokken het nieuwe normaal is?   Praet: 'Dat is het punt van discussie vandaag, waarover ook wij, centrale bankiers, het hebben. Zijn dit uitzonderingen en zal de toestand straks weer normaliseren? Ik denk het niet. En in dat klimaat zie je dat een deel van de hervormingen in Europa - denk aan de bankenunie - zijn gestopt in het midden van de weg. Ik hoop dat de politici de ‘sense of urgency’ beseffen… Op een bepaald moment was de ECB ‘the only game in town’, en dan was er veel discussie over wat we moesten doen en niet moesten doen, maar in het onzekere klimaat van vandaag vermag monetair beleid weinig, en dat is mijn bezorgdheid.'   In uw laatste interview in De Tijd in 2017 zei u nog dat u licht aan het einde van de tunnel zag.   Praet: 'De dingen werden op dat moment echt beter, de economie ging harder groeien, bedrijven draaiden op almaar vollere capaciteit. Ik zeg u dat we nu een nieuwe, moeilijkere schok beleven. Eén die nog altijd te managen valt, we beleven geen instorting. Maar wat als we nu economisch aan het pieken zijn, met de rente op een negatief peil, en met Duits overheidspapier waar beleggers voor betalen om erin te kunnen beleggen?'   Ondertussen blijft de ECB vasthouden aan zijn beleid van ultralage rentetarieven om de inflatie op te krikken. Als de wereld fundamenteel veranderd is, moet jullie mandaat dan niet mee evolueren?  Praet: 'Als we de rente zouden verhogen op het moment dat de economie vertraagt dan wordt alles nog erger. En het idee opwerpen om ons mandaat te herbekijken, is niet zonder risico. We kunnen niet zeggen dat we een strategische denkoefening lanceren, we moeten eerst weten wat het probleem is, weten wat we willen doen en in welke richting we willen gaan. En dan moet je zien dat mensen dat geheel niet gaan interpreteren alsof je toegeeft dat het beleid gefaald heeft. In tijden van populisme kan dat tot misverstanden leiden. '  Is waarschuwen voor de gevaren van te goedkoop geld populistisch?  Praet: 'Het klopt dat we op onze hoede moeten zijn voor de gevolgen van ons beleid: zeepbellen en een negatieve impact op de financiële stabiliteit. Maar dat zijn we ook. We maken constant die afweging. Ons beleid is niet ontworpen om permanent te zijn.'  Jean-Claude Trichet, ex-voorzitter van de ECB, voorspelt een financiële crisis die misschien harder zal zijn dan in 2008, omdat er nog altijd te veel schuld in het systeem zit, en omdat de rente al heel laag staat.   Praet: 'Een financiële crisis komt voort uit een hoge schuldgraad en een liquiditeitsrisico. China is kwetsbaar op dat vlak, maar in Europa zie ik vandaag weinig risico. Waar ik wel een risico in zie is in de praktijk om geld te lenen in yen, en vervolgens te herbeleggen in CLO’s, clusters van hoogrentende Amerikaanse bedrijfsschulden met een lange looptijd. De beleggers die daarmee bezig zijn, dekken hun wisselkoersrisico elke drie maanden opnieuw af met nieuwe financiële producten. Het is heel simpel en je kan er goed geld mee verdienen, maar het is heel riskant.'  Welke proporties neemt die praktijk aan?   Praet: 'Ik heb dat ook nagekeken, maar ik ken het definitieve antwoord nog niet. Wie daarmee bezig is? Ik denk dat het risico voor financiële instellingen in deze beperkt is, en dat andere financiële acteurs zoals investeringsfondsen het gros van de risico’s dragen. Het is een neveneffect van ons lagerentebeleid, dat is zeker, ja. Een bewijs dat hoe langer dat beleid aanhoudt, hoe meer je op je hoede moet zijn. Maar zoals gezegd: dat zijn we ook.'   Ondertussen zijn er mensen die van de centrale bank verwachten dat ze ook het klimaat redt.   Praet: 'Ik begrijp dat, omdat we een paar jaar geleden ook schijnbaar overal in betrokken waren, de reddingspakketten voor Griekenland, bijvoorbeeld. Maar we zitten al in een moeilijke omgeving waarbij we in de ogen van sommige waarnemers dichter bij politieke opdrachten gekomen zijn. Terwijl we net altijd neutraal moeten zijn. Als de overheid klimaatgerelateerde investeringen een duwtje in de rug wil geven, kan ze gewoon de regulering aanpassen. Het geld zal volgen.'   Kunnen overheden tijdelijk nog wat meer uitgeven om te vermijden dat de economie weer in een dip belandt?   Praet: 'In de VS ligt de groei hoger dan de rente, dus daar kan je in principe geld lenen om het uit te geven en erop verdienen. Voor Italië is het omgekeerde het geval, en zou dat bijvoorbeeld geen oplossing zijn. Maar los van de kostprijs van geld: het gaat er ook om waaraan je het geld als overheid besteedt. Als je het slecht investeert, is dat zeer gevaarlijk.'   Wat zegt u tegen de spaarders die maar blijven wachten op hogere rentes?   Praet: 'Ze kunnen hun geld uitgeven. Kijk, mijn spaargeld staat ook al jaren volledig op een spaarboekje, als spaarder vind ik die rentes ook niet leuk. Maar het zijn niet enkel wij, centraal bankiers, die de rente omlaag duwen. Een ouder wordende bevolking, een tragere groei van de productiviteit: dat zijn fundamentele factoren die op de rente wegen, maar dat is moeilijk uit te leggen aan de mensen. Het kan lang duren voor de rente weer omhoog gaat, de Japanners zijn nog altijd aan het wachten. Als je de prijzen van aandelen vergelijkt met risicovrije activaklassen zie je nog altijd dat mensen bijzonder risicoavers zijn. Ik zeg niet dat ze aandelen moeten kopen, maar mensen zijn nog altijd bang voor de toekomst en de vlucht naar veiligheid is nog altijd bezig. Een verdere integratie van Europa zou die trend kunnen verminderen.'   Wat gaat u hierna doen?  Praet: 'Ik word veel aan mijn mouw getrokken, … ik maak me geen zorgen. Ik wil wat meer van de industrie zien, en wat minder financiën. Vanuit een nieuwsgierigheid naar de andere kant. (wijst uit het raam) Je ziet daar het financieel centrum van Frankfurt liggen, mijn collega Benoît Coeuré kijkt aan de andere kant van de gang uit op de industrie. Die kant wil ik ook eens zien. (lacht) In de ECB heb ik regelmatig een rondetafel voor industriëlen gehouden. Om de polsslag van de industrie te meten. Dat heeft me altijd veel plezier gedaan om te horen wat ze vertellen over de reële economie. En ik wil ook wat rusten.'   Door te gaan golfen?  Praet: 'Misschien is dat fun, maar dat is niet mijn cultuur. Ik hou van wandelen met mijn vrouw. Eenvoudige dingen.'   In uw afscheidsspeech vermeldde u ook hoe u naar filmpjes van komieken over Trump kijkt. Wat hebt u daarmee?   Praet: 'Ik denk dat in de huidige omgeving humor erg belangrijk is. Ik hou van komieken als John Oliver en Stephen Colbert die de retoriek van Trump’s tweets parodiëren. Daar kan ik van genieten. Ik heb tot mijn 17de in Duitsland gewoond, die spirit van het carnaval zit in mij, denk ik.'  Wat gaat u het meeste missen aan uw werk hier?   Praet: 'De collega’s. Persoonlijke relaties maken een enorm verschil. Het doorbreken van menselijke relaties van de ene dag op de andere, dat vind ik niet gemakkelijk.  Ik heb veel gewerkt, het was zwaar, met veel verantwoordelijkheid. Maar alles bij elkaar was door de collegialiteit relatief gemakkelijk. Je job verlaten is vooral mensen achterlaten waar je het goed mee gedaan hebt. De raad van bestuur, veel andere mensen hier,… Mensen spreken altijd over Mario Draghi die alles leidt, maar de raad van bestuur bijvoorbeeld is een echt collectief. Ik zal altijd een uiterst warme herinnering koesteren aan de manier waarop we samengewerkt hebben.'   "
2019-05-31,Peter Praet,Entretien avec L‘Echo,"Entretien avec Peter Praet, membre du directoire de la BCE, accordé à Marc Lambrechts le 22 mai et publié le 1 juin 2019","  Entretien avec L‘Echo   Entretien avec Peter Praet, membre du directoire de la BCE, accordé à Marc Lambrechts le 22 mai et publié le 1 juin 2019  Vous avez reçu de nombreuses félicitations au terme de votre mandat à la BCE. Est-ce difficile pour vous de quitter Francfort ?   Je n’ai pas vraiment d’état d’âme, ce sera peut-être pour plus tard (rires). Mon départ ici était anticipé, c’est donc quelque chose de normal. Dans ma vie, j’ai souvent changé de job. C’est vrai que c’était un travail très prenant ici, avec un rythme de vie très intense. C’était beaucoup de travail et de responsabilités. Pendant huit ans, on a quand même vécu des moments très difficiles. Ce sur quoi j’insiste toujours, c’est la collégialité des décisions et l’esprit d’équipe. Lorsque j’étais en Belgique, j’ai aussi connu des moments compliqués. Ce qui m’a toujours énormément aidé dans des situations difficiles, c’est d’avoir toujours bénéficié du soutien de collègues, comme Luc Coene dans la crise bancaire en Belgiqueou ici à Francfort Mario Draghi. Au sein du conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE, je connais chacun de manière personnelle. Nos idées sont parfois différentes, mais nous respectons nos différences et essayons de prendre les meilleurs décisions possibles pour l’Union.   Y a-t-il une forme de soulagement au moment de ce départ? Oui et non. J’ai 70 ans et je débute une autre vie. Je ne sais pas encore exactement ce que je vais faire, mais je ne suis pas inquiet. On verra bien. C’est vrai que l’on met un terme du jour au lendemain à de nombreuses relations professionnelles. Mais j’ai déjà changé d’univers par le passé quand j’ai quitté la Générale de Banque ou la Banque nationale. Lors de ma soirée de départ à Francfort, je me suis rendu compte que je connaissais beaucoup de monde (rires). J’ai aussi reçu de nombreux de messages de collègues aux Etats-Unis qui ne pouvaient pas se déplacer à Francfort. J’étais moi-même surpris.  A la fin de ce voyage, ce long parcours professionnel, je me rends compte que j’ai de l’affection pour mes collègues, même s’ils ont parfois des idées différentes des miennes. Vous savez, tous font de leur mieux pour remplir leur mission. (Avec un peu d’émotion) Je suis désolé de dire cela, ce n’est peut-être pas très intéressant. Mais quitter un job, c’est aussi quitter des gens qu’on apprécie. Comme ici au conseil des gouverneurs. C’est presqu’une sorte de famille, où l’on se connaît très bien, où on se respecte et on s’apprécie. Certains disent que c’est Mario Draghi qui dirige tout à la BCE, mais la réalité est que c’est un travail collectif. Chacun joue son rôle, le président bien évidemment, moi en tant que chef économiste… Et nous avons toujours été la plupart du temps consensuels au conseil des gouverneurs.  Mario Draghi a indiqué que vous n’aviez jamais été mis en minorité (« outvoted ») lors des réunions du Conseil des gouverneurs. C’est une satisfaction ?  Ce que je fais lors des réunions du conseil des gouverneurs, c’est présenter la situation et les perspectives économiques. Je fais ensuite des propositions en matière de politique monétaire. Bien entendu, il y a parfois des discussions et des divergences. Et c’est positif. Si je n’ai jamais été mis en minorité lors du vote, c’est sans doute parce que les réunions étaient très bien préparées.   Si vous regardez en arrière, êtes-vous satisfait des résultats obtenus par la politique menée par la BCE ? La Banque n’a pas atteint ses objectifs d’inflation ces cinq dernières années.   Nous avons mené une politique souvent non-conventionnelle où nous avons dû nous montrer créatifs face aux événements. Quand vous faites un QE (achats d’actifs) ou que vous appliquez des taux d’intérêt négatifs, il faut se rendre compte que cela n’a jamais été testé auparavant. Cela a été un processus complexe. La communication est très importante. Il faut préparer les marchés et voir comment ils vont réagir. C’est très intensif. Depuis longtemps, je suis attentivement les marchés financiers. Attention, ce ne sont pas les marchés financiers qui disent ce que la BCE doit faire. Et ce n’est pas la BCE qui dit aux marchés comment ils doivent réagir. Cela va dans les deux sens.   Bizarrement, je ne vois pas d’écrans Reuters ou Bloomberg sur votre bureau…   Non, j’utilise beaucoup mon smartphone. C’est très facile. J’ai toutes les informations voulues. Je le consulte souvent durant la journée. Le cours de l’euro, la situation des marchés obligataires, les marchés boursiers… Regardez aujourd’hui, les marchés boursiers sont un peu plus faibles en Europe, l’euro est à 1,117 dollar. Je regarde ensuite le taux du Bund allemand, l’écart de taux avec l’Italie… Cela prend quelques secondes. On ne fonctionne plus comme auparavant.  Mais comment expliquer que l’objectif d’inflation n’a pas été atteint ?   Nous avons une évaluation positive de ce qui a été fait. Je sais qu’il s’agit d’un point controversé parce que l’inflation reste faible. D’abord, il est difficile de trouver une analyse contrefactuelle qui montre ce qui se serait produit sans notre intervention. Ensuite, il faut bien se rendre compte que nous avons connu une série de chocs répétés. Dernièrement, nous avons connu la crise chinoise durant l’été 2015, les incertitudes liées au Brexit, les remous commerciaux avec le président Donald Trump… Je pense que notre stratégie est la bonne, mais ces chocs ont compliqué la donne. Avec la nouvelle politique commerciale américaine et le Brexit, nous faisons face à de nouvelles sortes de chocs de nature géopolitique qui remettent même en question le cadre multilatéral. Cela a un impact sur la confiance. On voit que le cycle d’investissement dans l’industrie manufacturière ralentit. La politique monétaire peut aider dans ce contexte, mais elle ne peut pas tout faire. Avec le populisme et la fragmentation politique, il est plus compliqué de mettre en place des coalitions politiques fortes capables de conduire des réformes tout en prenant en compte leurs aspects distributifs. Au niveau international, nous sommes aujourd’hui dans une mentalité politique de jeu à somme nulle : si l’un gagne, c’est au détriment des autres. Une spirale protectionniste serait un désastre. Ce n’est plus la mentalité « win-win » de l’ère de la globalisation. C’est aux dirigeants politiques à apporter des réponses à ces incertitudes. Il y a un sentiment d’urgence.   La BCE devrait-elle modifier son mandat ? On voit qu’il existe une réflexion à ce sujet dans d’autres pays.   Il y a beaucoup d’idées venant des milieux académiques et nous les écoutons bien entendu. Mais nous avons un mandat qui est celui de la stabilité des prix. Et cela va continuer. Je ne pense pas que notre politique a failli. Ceci étant dit, quand une politique de taux bas se prolonge dans le temps, il nous faut bien entendu regarder les conséquences en termes de créations de bulles spéculatives et de stabilité financière. Cette politique n’a pas été conçue pour être permanente. D’autre part nous disposons aujourd’hui d’un cadre réglementaire plus rigoureux pour les banques et d’instruments macroprudentiels.  Que dites-vous aux épargnants belges qui attendent une hausse des taux sur leurs livrets d’épargne ? Etre patients ?  Mon argent se trouve aussi sur un livret d’épargne. Moi aussi, je ne trouve pas la situation plaisante. J’aimerais bien avoir des taux plus élevés sur mon épargne (rires). J’espérais qu’au moment de quitter la BCE, les taux seraient plus élevés. Mais nous avons eu tous ces nouveaux chocs géopolitiques. Nous ne sommes pas les seuls en tant que banquiers centraux à pousser les taux vers le bas. Il y a aussi des raisons fondamentales : le vieillissement de la population, une plus faible croissance de la productivité… Ce n’est pas toujours facile à expliquer à la population. Face à des taux bas, les gens peuvent dépenser leur argent ou se rendre chez leur gestionnaire d’actifs. On voit que la prime de risque des actions reste élevée en Europe. Je ne dis pas que les gens doivent acheter des actions, mais on voit que les investisseurs ont peur de l’avenir et qu’il y a toujours une demande pour les actifs sûrs, comme le Bund allemand.  Jean-Claude Trichet, l’ancien président de la BCE, a prévu récemment une nouvelle crise financière qui pourrait être pire que celle de 2008, en raison de l’augmentation de la dette liée aux taux bas. Georges Ugeux est également de cet avis.   Une crise financière globale survient en cas de trop grand endettement et de risque de crise de liquidité. La Chine est fragile à cet égard, mais je vois peu de risques dans la zone euro. Si je devais citer un risque pour lequel je suis inquiet, ce sont les gens qui empruntent dans une monnaie assortie de taux d’intérêt bas, comme le yen ou l’euro, et qui investissent dans un autre pays dans des produits affichant de plus hauts rendements. Par exemple des produits « CLO » (Collateralized loan obligations) composés d’obligations à long terme de sociétés américaines. Ces investisseurs couvrent leur risque de change tous les trois mois avec des swaps. C’est une stratégie qui apparaît simple et qui peut rapporter, mais qui est également hautement risquée. C’est une combinaison de risque de change et de risque de crédit. Et c’est un des effets collatéraux de la politique de taux bas. C’est à surveiller.  Certaines personnes dans la société pensent que la banque centrale devrait aussi intervenir au niveau du climat et dans la lutte contre le réchauffement de la planète.   Je suis très prudent. Nous avons eu l’image d’une banque centrale qui s’occupait de tout, comme le sauvetage de la Grèce. Les gens entendent que la BCE achète des actifs et crée de la liquidité. Mais nous devons le faire de manière neutre. Si les gouvernements veulent donner un coup de pouce à des investissements dans des produits liés au climat, ils devraient alors le faire par des instruments réglementaires ou fiscaux.    Quel est le meilleur moment de ce mandat de huit ans. Et le plus mauvais ?   Il y a eu beaucoup de bons moments, surtout quand nous arrivions à un consensus au sein du conseil des gouverneurs sur les décisions à prendre. Le plus mauvais moment, c’est le sentiment de panique financière qui a précédé le « whatever it takes » de Mario Draghi qui a sauvé l’euro en juillet 2012. Mais quand Mario est revenu de Londres où il avait prononcé cette fameuse phrase, cela fut vraiment un bon moment.  Dans votre discours d’adieu, vous avez indiqué que vous regardiez les imitations de Trump sur YouTube. C’est surprenant.   Je pense que dans le contexte actuel, l’humour est important. J’aime des comiques comme John Oliver et Stephen Colbert qui parodient la rhétorique de Trump dans ses tweets. J’apprécie ce genre de choses. Jusqu’à mes 17 ans, j’ai vécu en Allemagne. Et l’esprit du carnaval reste en moi, je pense.  Avez-vous déjà eu des contacts pour votre vie future ?   J’ai déjà reçu diverses demandes. J’aimerais peut-être m’occuper davantage d’industrie et moins de finance. C’est une question de curiosité. (Il regarde la fenêtre) Vous voyez, ici, c’est le centre financier de Francfort. Mon collègue Benoît Coeuré dont le bureau est à l’opposé a une vue sur le centre industriel de la ville. J’aime parler avec des industriels. A la BCE, j’ai organisé des réunions régulières avec des responsables de l’industrie. J’apprécie d’avoir leur sentiment sur l’état de l’économie réelle. J’aimerais aussi peut-être m’investir dans la communication sur le rôle des banques centrales. Et aussi me reposer un peu.   Et jouer au golf ?   C’est peut-être « fun », mais ce n’est pas dans ma culture. J’aime me promener avec mon épouse. Rien de spécial, comme vous le voyez.   "
2019-05-08,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, published on 8 May 2019","  Interview with the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, published on 8 May 2019  In what context did you first come across Pfandbriefe?  Before joining the ECB, I spent five years managing France’s debt and cash at Agence France Trésor, the French equivalent of the Finance Agency in Germany. That’s when I first came across Pfandbriefe as an important building block of Europe’s fixed income market.  What is the importance of Pfandbriefe and other covered bonds in monetary transmission?  Covered bonds play an important role in the monetary policy transmission process, in particular in a traditionally bank-based economy like the euro area. The covered bond purchase programme, for example, has lowered banks’ funding costs directly and thereby encouraged banks to extend more credit to firms and households at more attractive levels. It was not by chance that covered bonds were the first asset class to be purchased outright by the Eurosystem for monetary policy purposes in 2009. In addition, covered bonds make up a large share of the collateral that banks use to borrow funds in Eurosystem monetary policy operations, ensuring that banks have access to central bank funding.  Do you think the harmonisation of covered bonds will be a success?  The ECB supports efforts to create a harmonised, high-quality and transparent covered bond market in the European Union. The legislative proposal on covered bonds made by the European Commission in March 2018 is an important step in that direction, also with a view to promoting a further deepening of the capital markets union. The ECB also sees merit in the proposed directive serving as a basis for new national legislation on covered bonds. Finally, the importance of private initiatives to achieve harmonisation should also be emphasised, in particular the covered bond label created by the European Covered Bond Council in 2012. National differences will of course not vanish overnight, but I am confident that practices will increasingly converge across EU countries over time.  Will innovation, e.g. ”green” covered bonds transform the market and, if so, how?  Successful innovations, if managed prudently, have always been important drivers of financial market developments. In the covered bond market, as in other market segments, I see “green” covered bonds as a promising innovation and transformation for the future, given the growing awareness among the general public that environmentally-friendly economic activities should be supported.

2019-04-23,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Johannes Pennekamp and Philip Plickert on 17 April 2019 and published on 23 April 2019","  Interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung    Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Johannes Pennekamp and Philip Plickert on 17 April 2019 and published on 23 April 2019  Mr Cœuré, the fire at Notre-Dame was a catastrophe for France and Europe. My sincere condolences! We hope that the cathedral can be rebuilt as quickly and as beautifully as possible.  I found it all very moving; I lived in Paris for twenty years. But what also moved me greatly and impressed me was the great sympathy and solidarity from the whole of Europe. Notre-Dame is the most visited historic building in Europe – it embodies many of Europe’s values. It is good to see that there was such a strong sense of commonality after the disaster.  Let’s turn to monetary policy. Complaints about the ECB’s negative interest rate on deposits have increased significantly. Each year Europe’s banks are paying around EUR 7.5 billion in “penalty interest”. Mario Draghi has indicated that a tiering of the negative interest rate could be considered in order to relieve the burden on them. Would you be in favour of that?  I find the intensity of the discussion surprising, because it focuses on a narrow aspect of our monetary policy. The debate about interest rates being low for long should be broader. We understand the concerns of those affected by the harmful side effects of very low interest rates. These are increasing with time. There are possible concerns about financial stability; asset prices are rising. Bank profitability is also a concern. However, the negative deposit rates are really not the biggest problem. Their contribution to low bank profits is limited. Banks should think more about their costs.  Does that mean that you are not in favour of a softer, tiered negative interest rate?  No, it doesn’t. It is a useful, relevant discussion that we have had before and should revisit regularly. Japan and Switzerland have tiered systems. But the negative deposit rate is not the most important reason why interest rates are so low. If we change something, there has to be a monetary policy reason for doing so. At the current juncture, I do not see the monetary policy argument for tiering. However, we must keep a close eye on developments. Those who would profit from tiering are, above all, banks with high excess liquidity, of which many are located in France and Germany where bank lending is already running high. Thus there is no evidence so far that the negative deposit rate is bad for lending. On the contrary.  The Governing Council of the ECB says that key interest rates will remain as low as now until at least the end of 2019. However, some bank analysts do not expect the first interest rate rise until late 2020.  We are not tied to such market expectations; they are an important input, but we are not led by them.  Are those who do not expect an interest rate rise until later completely wrong?  Well, that reflects an assessment of the downside risks which is different to that of the Governing Council.  There has been a lot of bad news on the economy recently: sentiment indexes and industrial new orders have fallen. How bad is the economic situation in the euro area?  I have mixed feelings. On one hand, the slowdown in growth is probably only temporary. We expect growth to return in the second half of the year. There are no grounds for overly gloomy thoughts. On the other hand, it is very uncertain how long and how strong the downturn will be. The reasons for the uncertainty are political: the trade tensions stemming from the United States, and also Brexit to some extent. Growth will only return in the second half of the year if there are signs of a resolution to the trade dispute.  The ECB’s growth forecast for this year in the euro area is 1.1%, and next year 1.6%.  Yes, that is the current staff forecast, which will be revised in June.  Germany is very dependent on exports; it is particularly hard hit by the weakness in trade. Is a recession – at least according to the technical definition of two negative quarters – thinkable?  No, we do not expect a recession. But it is true that the economic slowdown in Germany is stronger than we had expected. There were temporary factors, such as the problems with emission tests in the car industry. Now things depend mainly on growth in emerging economies, above all China. The German export-oriented growth model also entails risks. It was very advantageous during the upturn of the global economy, now things are not so good.  Would you advise the German Government to increase domestic demand?  The ECB does not lecture the German Government. In its “European Semester” reports, the European Commission made it clear that Germany should balance its growth and increase domestic demand. That could be done, above all, through more investment, which would be good for the Germany economy. In Europe there is much discussion about the level of budget deficits. Of course the amount of the deficit is important for keeping debt under control, but it would be at least as important to talk more about the composition of expenditure. Most countries, including my home country France and also Italy, have no fiscal room for manoeuvre for more spending. However, through reallocation, the expenditure could become more growth-friendly.  To return to the more technical side of the ECB’s policy: you gave banks four-year loans in the order of hundreds of billions of euro, so-called “TLTROs”, which will soon expire. For this there will be follow-on loans. Again with such favourable conditions, even in part a negative interest rate?  The TLTRO loans are not a subsidy for the banks; they are a monetary policy instrument aimed at ensuring adequate lending. The Governing Council will presumably decide on the conditions, including the interest rate, in June. The remarkable progress in lending to the real economy will have to be taken into account. The situation today is very different to 2016, when we issued the last TLTROs to actively support lending. However, we want to protect this achievement.  So the conditions no longer need to be so generous?  The Governing Council will decide on that based on economic data.  The key measure of the success of the ECB’s policy is price stability. Contrary to what the ECB repeatedly forecasts, the rate of inflation remains below the target; the curve is not upward-sloping, but is flat. Inflation could still remain very low for a long time. And that is in spite of the fact that wages are rising significantly. Consumer prices are not following. Is that a puzzle?  It is half a puzzle. At least wages are now rising, following the fall in unemployment, as we had expected. But what is missing is the transmission from wage costs to product and consumer prices. That is a bit puzzling. Businesses are apparently accepting narrower profit margins rather than raising prices. That may be because they do not think demand is strong enough yet and because of strong global competition. But that cannot go on forever. At some point they will raise prices. However, the most recent slowdown in the economy is a setback.  This autumn, ECB President Mario Draghi will step down after eight years in office. So far the ECB has had a Dutchman, a Frenchman and an Italian at its helm, but so far no president from Germany. Can you understand why many Germans want the next President of the ECB to come from here?  I understand that, but it’s the wrong way of looking at things. The choice of ECB President should not be based on nationality, but on competence.  But we should not pretend to be so naïve as to think that political and national considerations do not play a role!  Yes, of course, I understand the political process. But the selection should be based on competence. And, if you ask me, I would also be happy to see a woman at the helm of the ECB. Ultimately, there are various criteria – and it is a political decision.  So, what must an ECB President have in terms of qualities, abilities and knowledge?  You will have to ask the European Heads of State or Government; they decide that. What I would say as a central banker is that you have to be a good central bank manager, you must have a strong background in and knowledge of economics, and you must understand the capital markets – without being a hostage to market expectations – and you should uphold the independence of the ECB. And you need to have the ability to lead and to make compromises.  You have ambitions yourself. Some say you have a 10 percent chance of becoming ECB President. However, you are on the Executive Board, and it is crystal clear in the EU Treaty that a re-appointment of Executive Board members is prohibited.  I won’t give any legal interpretations. That is up to the EU Heads of State or Government. I have worked for Europe for the last seven years. I also want to continue to serve Europe. The central bank is a place where I can be useful. But, of course, I can also be useful elsewhere.  The ECB leadership has apparently already obtained legal advice which played out the case of you briefly stepping down and then being “re-”appointed as President. Would that not be a blatant ploy? A breach of the spirit of the rules?  I am not a lawyer.  But you would like to do it?  Who wouldn’t? But it is not a position that you apply for. We must respectfully wait to see what the politicians decide.  The next President of the ECB will have no easy task. He …   He or she …   He or she must drive forward the “normalisation” of monetary policy. What is that, actually? What is normal?  An interesting question. A lot of thought is given to that at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Federal Open Market Committee of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve System, asks its members explicitly for their estimate of the longer-term development of interest rates. We don’t do that. We in Europe are also lagging far behind the US economic cycle. I don’t know what the long-term aim for interest rates in Europe should be. But for me, “normalisation” means that the key interest rates are again the main instrument of monetary policy – as they were before the crisis. We are not there yet. The bond purchase programme – “quantitative easing” – is not yet over, because we are reinvesting the proceeds from the maturing bonds. Each month we reinvest a substantial sum. Second, the “forward guidance” is now our main instrument; steering the market through words, not through interest rate changes. We are not abandoning the prospect of normalisation, but it has been delayed by the economic downturn.  In the medium term, should the ECB reduce its balance sheet again?  Yes, like the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve kept its bond holdings for a considerable time after the end of the net purchases and then started winding down its holdings. But in Europe we have not got that far yet.  With all due respect for your optimism regarding the economy, what will happen if there is a really strong downturn, perhaps even another full-blown recession? What could the ECB actually still do?  The best answer is that we have managed in the past. Every time there has been a major challenge, we have found a solution. I am confident that, in the event of a shock, we will find a solution in our toolkit that is within our mandate. Monetary financing is prohibited. But I would caution against the view that only the ECB should have to react to a crisis. We do not know what the next crisis will look like. Every crisis is different. There will be another crisis; there will always be more crises. It would be very unwise to think that the next crisis will be managed by the ECB without any measures having to be taken by governments. The burden of tackling crises must not rest on the shoulders of the ECB alone.  However, you have already used up most of your ammunition: key interest rates are at zero; the bond purchases have almost reached the limits you set yourselves. What more could you do?  We do not answer this question because it all depends on the type of crisis that we are facing at the time. We have not had a discussion about this in the Governing Council either. Experience has shown, however, that we have a broad range of instruments.   Do the possible instruments also include a devaluation of cash, to make even lower negative interest rates possible? After all, there are already working papers on this subject in the IMF and the ECB. What would citizens make of that?  Simple answer: it is up to the citizens to decide whether they want to use cash. For instance, Sweden is moving in the direction of a cashless society; in the euro area countries, demand for cash is still growing. The central banks are working on digital central bank money as an alternative to cash. We are investigating that. But we do not want to abolish cash.  The question was a different one. The academic working papers of the IMF and the ECB are not about the abolition of cash, but a devaluation through negative interest rates, a kind of penalty interest on banknotes.  That is not a new idea. Silvio Gesell came up with it 100 years ago. But it is not a practical discussion for us.  In the forthcoming European elections, anti-EU, anti-euro and populist parties will probably gain seats. Are you worried that the EU and EU institutions will be weakened by that?  There will probably be a more fragmented Parliament. The legislative decision-making process will be more difficult. Politics as a whole will be more difficult and more complex. We hope nonetheless that European Economic and Monetary Union will be completed. A push towards a capital markets union is needed.  What is that exactly?  A capital markets union means greater integration of the capital markets; a better cross-border allocation of savings. By way of a specific example, a German company investing in French or Spanish companies and vice versa. We don’t see enough of that yet. Capital should go where it is most productive.  A few years ago, Wolfgang Schäuble, as Finance Minister, once complained that the ECB’s low interest rate policy was 50% responsible for the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Germany. Perhaps he wasn’t being entirely serious but the fact is that many citizens are frustrated about the low interest rates which, for example, make retirement provision more difficult. Has the ECB played a part in the success of populist parties?  When the ECB is given the blame for political outcomes, that says more about politics than it does about the ECB. We clearly have a political framework in Europe that has not delivered what the people expect; not the growth, the employment nor the income that people in many countries want. The ECB is an easy scapegoat. Our tower here in Frankfurt is highly visible; many eyes are on us. Yes, we must take into consideration the side effects of our policy, the effects on savers, on house prices, etc. We take that very seriously. But the bottom line is that our low interest rate policy has benefited savers more than it has harmed them, since savers are also workers and borrowers. And in the housing market the low interest rate has also helped encourage more construction. The criticism is often too simplistic.    "
2019-04-02,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Risques,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Hervé Lorenzi, François-Xavier Albouy, Arnaud Chneiweiss, Pierre-Charles Pradier and Philippe Trainar, on 4 February 2019 and published on 2 April 2019","  Interview with Risques   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Hervé Lorenzi, François-Xavier Albouy, Arnaud Chneiweiss, Pierre-Charles Pradier and Philippe Trainar, on 4 February 2019 and published on 2 April 2019  Is it true to say that we’re in a more risky world today than we were ten or fifteen years ago?  We’re in a period of political and technological change. This change is accelerating, especially in the field of technology, and market participants are probably underestimating it. In certain industries, including the financial industry, rapid technological change can lead create risks as well as opportunities. Political risk is also evolving; it’s moving into developed countries. I’ve just returned from meetings in South Africa with African central banks. My African colleagues were saying: “We Africans have always known that we had to manage economic and developmental challenges and challenges stemming from political transition. But that was in an environment where we had some stability and an overview of what was happening in Europe, the United States and China. But now the instability is coming from the United States and, to a certain extent, from Europe and China. So now we have to learn to become a pillar of stability ourselves.” That line of thinking, which is new for Africa, is one we in Europe have been following since 1957: how, with our own economic and political tools, can we become self-sufficient and a pillar of stability ourselves? Ever since Frank Knight’s work in the 1920s, economists have made a distinction between risk (which is based on quantifiable probabilities) and uncertainty (which doesn’t lend itself to being quantified). To take up this distinction again, you could say that we also find ourselves in a world where there is more uncertainty than risk, because the issues have become political in nature: uncertainty about the relationship between the United States and China – with all its trade, security and intellectual property consequences; uncertainty about Brexit… Market participants are at a loss to form opinions in these circumstances. In fact, everyone is! This creates non-diversifiable risk which has no market price and leads to heightened anxiety. So it’s not surprising that markets are turning to the public sector, in particular central banks such as the Federal Reserve System and the ECB, for reassurance.  One of the sources of uncertainty for insurers (and others, too) is interest rates. In particular, quantitative easing, or QE, which affected the entire yield curve. Aren’t interest rates gradually eluding market participants’ expectations, leading them to wonder what sort of market equilibrium will exist at these rates? What constraints could affect the ECB’s decision-making? Isn’t this a strong driver of cycles and uncertainty?  Market participants can see the benefits of central banks managing the yield curve, because it fosters economic activity and stability. It is true that part of how interest rates are set is eluding market mechanisms. Nevertheless, we have to put this discussion into perspective. On the one hand, it’s nothing new: by design, monetary policy always has an impact on interest rates. On the other hand, since the start of QE and in all market segments, including sovereign debt as well as corporate debt, the ECB has always taken care not to suppress the price formation mechanism. As an example, this is one of the reasons why the ECB does not purchase more than 33% of a sovereign issuance. Central banks now have a strong influence on the entire yield curve, over a very long horizon. The counterpart to this is to be transparent towards the market and to provide visibility and predictability concerning how we are going to act. That’s the purpose of our forward guidance, which clarifies our reaction function. Forward guidance is not an unconditional commitment about what we are going to do. That’s not something we would be able to do and we wouldn’t be credible, as we necessarily react to new information flows we receive. It does, however, provide clarity about how our monetary policy incorporates these information flows. If we explain this reaction function to the markets clearly enough, then they can incorporate it into the price formation mechanisms. And we feel that this has worked rather well. The markets find the way we conduct forward guidance useful.  Today, particularly in the United States, there is a debate about whether forward guidance should be abolished and replaced with completely opportunistic policy that could be fairly arbitrary.  This discussion makes sense when monetary policy normalisation is at a more advanced stage. After all, our monetary policy before the crisis did not include forward guidance and that seemed perfectly normal to everyone. Once monetary policy has completely normalised, the reference tool will once again be the interest rate and not the size or composition of the central bank’s balance sheet. So it is valid to wonder whether forward guidance then still serves a purpose. But that is not the situation the ECB is in. The normalisation of our monetary policy will depend on economic indicators and, in any case, it will be a very long and gradual process. So forward guidance will be needed for a good while yet – for as long as this normalisation process takes.  For economists who have taught courses on monetary economics, this is all very surprising. Nobody would have imagined that central banks could affect long-term interest rates and that the huge pool of liquidity wouldn’t stoke inflation. This assumption is being fundamentally challenged. It goes well beyond the monetary aspect.  We are in a period where theory is lagging behind reality, as has already happened in the past. In recent years, monetary economics has progressed significantly. For example, we have a substantial body of theoretical work on quantitative easing from Curdia, Woodford and others. We have also made a lot of progress in incorporating financial frictions into the models used by central banks. This began in the United States before spreading to Europe. It’s also an opportunity to revive monetary schools of thought that had disappeared. Discussions about negative interest rates, for example, have provided an opportunity to revisit the work of Silvio Gesell and his theory of banknote demurrage, which had become a theoretical oddity but is becoming significant once more. The crisis was an opportunity to test the vitality of economic theory and its responsiveness, and I think this was a positive thing for this field of study.  The euro is 20 years old. What conclusions can we draw so far? What is missing that would enable Europe to be more than just a pillar of stability; that would enable it to be a pillar of growth?   The euro has provided price stability, which is a necessary condition for growth. And it has protected countries that would have been more severely affected by the financial crisis if they hadn’t been part of the euro area. Contrary to widespread public opinion, purchasing power has been better protected since 1999 than it ever was before then. On average, inflation has been lower since 1999. So one of the euro’s concrete objectives, to control inflation, has been achieved. But it was a mistake – or false hope – to think that the euro would, in and of itself, create long-term growth. Euro area governments would have had to take advantage of the stable environment provided by the euro to implement more investment and education policies, and reform policies focused on long-term growth. For example, in France at the time the euro was created there was a rather naive belief that the euro would automatically generate convergence between the participating economies. But that was not at all what happened; the euro actually created divergence, rather than convergence, because it lacked supporting policies, which, for the most part, were a matter for the national level. Eventually we grew to understand that good monetary policy, while clearly necessary, isn’t enough on its own. The euro area needs a much more structured economic policy, with instruments that we still don’t have today, and it needs responsible fiscal policies. That’s the part that still needs to be completed.  The situation in Europe is not just linked to stability or the lack of industrial policy. The countries with declining populations are not driving forces. What are the positive signs for Europe?  The ECB’s diagnosis of the euro area economy is the following. The slowdown we have seen since 2018 didn’t come as a surprise. 2017 saw a very strong cyclical recovery supported by dynamic global trade and strengthened, somewhat artificially, by a mistimed fiscal boost in the United States. We knew that it couldn’t last. Growth is now returning to rates that are closer to potential, albeit sooner and faster than expected. In the last quarter of 2018, GDP grew by 0.3% in France, so we’re a long way off from a recession. Even assuming that growth remains at similar levels in the coming quarters – which is not in line with the ECB’s staff projections, which expect growth in the euro area to rise from 1.1% in 2019 to 1.6% in 2020 – that is, even if growth in France were to stabilise at around 1.2%, that would probably be fairly close to the potential growth rate in France, which corresponds to productive capacity. Potential growth is weaker than it was before the crisis, because a lot of investment and human capital has been lost. It will take time for potential growth to recover, and in the meantime the demographic slowdown continues. A topic that is attracting increasing attention in the academic debate in the United States, and one that Europe should look at more closely, is the link between competition and productivity. Several economists, such as Thomas Philippon, are now saying that there is not enough competition and profit margins are too high in the United States, and that this has been bad for productivity gains. We need to look at this topic in Europe; and it may be that we reach different conclusions for different sectors. The link between competition and productivity isn’t the same for manufacturing and services. In the services sector, opening up regulated professions increases competition and improves productivity, while for the manufacturing sector, which is already very exposed to international competition, the question is a more open one. Relatively little is known about these topics, but they have a significant bearing on the diagnosis for potential growth.  On the same subject, there is a debate in France about whether reductions in the cost of unskilled labour need to have a limit. In the very short term, this would create more jobs, of course, but isn’t it just as important to lower the cost of high-skilled labour, which is a driver of economic growth?  My view as an economist is that we need to support both types of employment, but with different instruments. We need a strong services sector because there is a social demand for low productivity services, in particular human services, and because there need to be jobs for low-skilled workers. But we also need to support the manufacturing sector, because it is manufacturing that creates productivity, exports, and so on. That doesn’t mean that we have to use the same instrument. Empirical studies have shown that cutting payroll taxes is more effective at the lower end of the wage scale. That doesn’t mean that the manufacturing sector doesn’t need any support, but it’s better to target support towards research and development (R&D), as well as training, rather than lowering payroll taxes far above the minimum wage, which would push up wages instead of creating jobs.  It isn’t the ECB’s responsibility, but why hasn’t there been enough employment and growth in the euro area? It’s a question of labour, linked to cutting costs. In all advanced economies, we have recently seen that the wave that hit low-skilled labour is starting to hit routine skilled jobs. And these routine skilled jobs are not at the minimum wage.  In the 1990s, and up until China joined the World Trade Organization, there was a general acceptance that the unchecked globalisation of trade and finance – the Washington consensus – was the best way of creating prosperity. Any remaining reservations on the subject were abandoned. Economists and politicians gave it their blessing and, in developed economies, made an incorrect diagnosis that went along the following lines: it’s no problem, for sure technological progress and globalisation will destroy low-skilled jobs, but we will still have an advantage, because we’re going to invest in R&D and education, and the goods and services we produce will be of better quality and we will sell them to less advanced economies. But it didn’t work that way, and there are two reasons for this, in my view. First, emerging economies, and China in particular, have seen much quicker improvements in quality than expected, and at the same time technological disruption has meant that technical progress hasn’t just destroyed low-skilled jobs, it is also destroying medium-skilled jobs and maybe soon, as a result of artificial intelligence, start affecting high-skilled jobs. Second, we didn’t manage to invest in education and R&D that would have enabled us to stay ahead. Education is an area that is particularly concerning and one of the big challenges for France, looking at the findings of the OECD and of the public think tank France Stratégie.  By 2030, one in five people will be over 65. Is it possible that, at some point in the future, there will be quantitative easing for financing of the voluntary sector? For the kinds of investment in associations which, since they provide support for elderly people and employ large numbers of people, are known to generate wellbeing, health, and so on?  I disagree, but for institutional reasons rather than economic ones. It’s clear that significant demographic developments change the structure of our economies and, thus, the way in which we conduct monetary policy. For instance, the Japanese presidency of the G20 has made demographic change one of its priorities for 2019. We’ve had seminars, among central banks too, on its impact on relative prices, inflation and the structure of production. But the ECB doesn’t have a mandate to finance adjustments in the economy. Money creation holds a certain fascination, and there is always a temptation to project public policy failings onto the ECB by asking it to remedy them. There is the same debate about adjusting to climate change, which some expect the ECB to finance. But asking the ECB to finance adjustment to climate change, to finance demographic transition, to finance infrastructure… that would mean giving a technocratic institution the power to set priorities for public spending, which is the essence of political debate. And some people, sometimes the same people, already accuse the ECB of acting politically! Politicising the central bank is the best way of weakening its actions. Our contribution is to have created a monetary environment that is conducive to such investments. The current environment, with rates at zero or close to zero, also at a very long horizon, is exceptionally favourable. The question of how this favourable environment should be put to use – by investing in climate-related matters, ageing or something else altogether – that is a political debate for parliaments.  Your experience means that you are just as familiar with the German economy as with the French economy. The recent social unrest in France has revealed a divergence between Paris and the regions that isn’t seen at all in Germany, where the regions are extremely developed. Can you explain this phenomenon? In France, all regional development policies have failed.  You’re right, one advantage of having European experience is that it makes it possible to stand back and look at the French situation a bit more objectively! The field of operation of the French elite is geographically very concentrated. The German elite are more dispersed: they hold positions in large corporations, in foundations, in the world of politics. They are spread quite widely in Germany. In France, most of them are based in Paris and have graduated from the same elite universities (“grandes écoles”), not to mention the lack of diversity with regard to background and gender, where Europe lags far behind the Anglo-Saxon world. So it is not surprising if the system of administration and economic support is organised in such a way as to benefit first and foremost certain large companies and significant players, which in turn holds back innovation and growth.  The European insurance market is very fragmented. The Spanish market leader, for example, is unknown in France. Why have markets remained national in the insurance sector?  The ECB has no competence in the field of insurance. In fact, it’s one of the things that the Treaty forbids it to do. So it’s not a sector that we follow very closely. But if we look at non-bank financial intermediation more generally, there is still a high degree of fragmentation. There has not been the institutional integration that we have seen in the banking sector. This will take time, because once you get into non-bank territory, you very quickly come up against non-financial barriers related to corporate law and different legal traditions. National laws differ, especially – but not only – with regard to bankruptcy, and there are 27 different approaches to mobilising collateral, and so on. These are all barriers to capital markets integration. We need a legal environment that allows integration, and this presupposes far-reaching changes to legal traditions.  When you joined the ECB, did you expect such an environment, including the dynamism? Quantitative easing was something that was unimaginable for our generation.  When I joined the ECB in 2012, some people said to me that it would be interesting from a technical and human point of view, because the world of central banking operates on a very high level in intellectual and human terms, but that it would be a bit boring. As you can probably imagine, it has not once been boring since 2012! The most cherished dream of central bankers is for their profession to become boring again, but we haven’t got to that point yet...   "

Many German economists and politicians are convinced of exactly that, leading them to harshly criticise the ECB leadership under Mario Draghi.   I appreciate that people are concerned, it's true that putting money into a savings account these days will earn you very little interest. But it's also true to say that people can only save if they have a job and earn enough money to put some savings aside. Our monetary policy has made an important contribution to boosting employment and wage growth. And people are not only savers, but also entrepreneurs and home buyers, who benefit from low interest rates. So the question we need to ask ourselves is: if the ECB had not taken certain measures in the past, what state would the economy be in today?   And how would you answer that?   There was a high risk of deflation in the euro area. Deflation would have meant falling prices, with people therefore postponing their purchasing decisions in anticipation of prices falling even further. At the same time, firms would have reined in investment and there would have been job cuts. That is a vicious circle. So it was absolutely right to counteract this danger by lowering interest rates and to generally loosen monetary policy in order for us to bring inflation to a level below, but close to, 2%.   The ECB has now bought government bonds and other securities amounting to €2.6 trillion. Interest rates have been at zero for years. You are offering banks unlimited credit, as long as they can back it with appropriate collateral. The official motivation for taking all these measures was to bring the inflation rate up to just below 2%. That is the ECB's inflation target. But inflation is currently at 1.5% and the ECB has fallen short of 2% for years. So what is the point of it all?   Again, we had to respond to the risk of deflation; and we have come nearer to our aim of maintaining an appropriate level of inflation over the medium term. Our actions have had an effect: lending to households has been boosted just as much as lending to companies. So we have seen an overall rise in the propensity to invest. The negotiated wage agreements also show that our measures are having an impact. Wage growth in the euro area stands at more than 2%, and it is even slightly higher in Germany. That will push up prices. But it is slower than we had thought.   Why?  The level of economic growth is one factor, but another is the labour market. As far as economic growth is concerned, there have been repeated setbacks over the past few years. Geopolitical uncertainties such as Brexit and the threat of protectionism are currently weighing on economic sentiment. That is also why inflation remains subdued. Moreover, it has taken a long time for the decline in unemployment to be reflected in higher wages. The number of people who lost their jobs in the crisis but never registered themselves as unemployed has been underestimated. When the economy revived, these people returned to the labour market. A great many people, above all part-time workers, began to work longer hours when the upswing set in. In brief, the labour supply was underestimated. It's only when the labour market has thoroughly cleared that wages start to climb more steeply. We're seeing that in Germany for example.   One serious criticism of the ECB's programme is that it is effectively only subsidising the southern crisis countries. The central bank has pushed interest rates down. Without this life-saver, Italy would have gone bankrupt long ago and the euro would have been history.   Hold on a moment. All have benefited from the measures. The savings for taxpayers resulting from lower interest rates were nowhere as high as in Germany.   But isn't it also true that the ECB is indirectly financing governments here? Any creditor who invests in Italian or Spanish government bonds knows that the ECB will buy these bonds off them in the future.   Even though I am not the strongest advocate of our government bond purchases, we do not finance individual governments with them, directly or indirectly. Our aim is to maintain price stability. Thanks to our bond purchases, interest rates go down and loans become cheaper, primarily benefiting households and businesses. Besides, we have a very clear set of criteria for the timing, selection and volumes of our government bond purchases. Our parameters ensure that the private market for government bonds remains intact. One sign of the continuing relevance of this market is the divergence in the prices for German, Italian and Spanish government bonds.   Another criticism is that the ECB defers problems rather than solving them. Owing to the low interest rates, cheap credit is even available to firms that are no longer competitive, and would otherwise have gone under long ago. These zombie firms tie up capital and employees, all of which is harmful to economic efficiency.   We have only bought corporate bonds with high ratings. This has indeed improved financing conditions predominantly for the companies in question, but also indirectly for the firms with lower credit standing. However, banks lending to companies must take the risk involved into account in their financing conditions. So, basically, the higher the risk, the more expensive the loan. Moreover, European banking supervision requires more capital to cover the risk and looks very closely at credit standards. And indeed: not every group in the euro area can borrow for five years at less than 3% interest. There are differences not only across countries, but also across firms within the individual countries.   The role of government debt is now the subject of heated international debate. One argument that comes up more and more often is that the significance of debt has been systematically overestimated. Large countries with their own central banks have no need to worry. Japan and the United States, two countries that are highly indebted but nonetheless pay low interest rates, often serve as examples.   That is impossible in the euro area, for purely legal reasons if nothing else. We have set maximum limits on the Member States’ levels of deficit and debt. And the ECB cannot buy government bonds on the primary market, for example bonds which other market participants no longer want because of, say, doubts about the sustainability of a country’s debt. We can only purchase government bonds on the secondary market to a limited extent and only if such a purchase is absolutely necessary to maintain price stability. These are the legal conditions.  And what are the economic ones?  In the recent debt crisis we had a front-seat view of what happens when individual countries build up too much debt. These states lose the confidence of market participants and their access to credit, or can only borrow at extremely high rates of interest. Moreover, I think we have to reflect on the burden we are leaving to other generations. You can’t keep on building up debt, sooner or later you will have to repay it.   But you are not putting it correctly. Ideally, we would not only pass on our debts to future generations, but also assets that were created from that debt.   That can’t work if you are living permanently above your means. When a crisis breaks out, we are pleased if countries have a buffer enabling them to make anticyclical investments and stimulate growth. Only countries that have previously pursued sound economic policies have that buffer.   "
2019-03-29,Peter Praet,Interview with Bloomberg TV,"Interview of Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow on 27 March 2019 and broadcast on 28 March 2019","  Interview with Bloomberg TV   Interview of Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow on 27 March 2019 and broadcast on 28 March 2019  The President is talking about mitigating the side effect of negative rates. Does that mean tiering is coming?  Praet: Well, I think don't rush. I think it's a bit premature to take that conclusion. What is clear now is that the perspective of low rates for longer has triggered that debate about the side effects of negative rates. I think it's fair to say that this issue has to be analysed carefully. But you need in any case to find a monetary policy case; you cannot just conclude let's do the theory because the economy is slowing down and the rates are low for longer. I think it's fair to say that we have to go into this issue but we need to have a convincing monetary policy case to do that. Now, when you look at the economy today and the lending channel, we don't see any particular problem in the lending channel today. As we know with the weakening economy it may happen in the future so you have to be ready and to look at the possible instruments or decisions you may need to take in case. So readiness, yes, but I think don't rush too quickly to conclusions but it's fair to say that the conversation has started.  If the conversation has started, does it mean that interest rates will stay low for even longer?  Praet: I think it's difficult to say today. When you look at prices, market prices, yes the date of the first lift-off has been pushed further by market participants, so this debate on the tiering has been coming. As I say, the perspective of rates for longer is something you have to look at, all the consequences of that.  Does tiering make the tool of negative interest rates less effective?  Praet: The negative rates have been extremely useful to support the economy basically because the opportunity costs of saving have been low. So you push people either to spend or to go into more risk and supporting the economy, going into investment and all that. We have been big effects of the negative rates on the economy, which is good also for the banks themselves because if their customers do better it's also good for them. The question that comes today is that with the slowing of the economy, because of international and geopolitical factors, you get lower growth, then you get also the negative effect of the rate situation on the intermediation margin. That's how the debate has been triggered. Now, on the economy you have to see how the things will evolve.   Now, German Bunds are yielding negative; is that a red flag for the ECB?  Praet: Well, it reflects concerns because basically, our policy – our communication has not changed recently. We have this forward guidance which basically says that the rates are going to stay at the present level until through the end of the year. But the recent increase of Bund prices where the rates really fell to zero or even negative rates, reflects concerns in the market and some flight to safety. So they reflect a concern about the economy in general, yes, so it's an indication of uncertainties in the market, yes.  Are you particularly concerned about Germany?  Praet: I am not particularly concerned about Germany. I think balance sheets in general of NFCs – non-financial corporations – of households and of the state actually are in good shape. I think this is a country that can absorb a number of shocks. Of course on the other side the German economy is very much depending on manufacturing, as we know that manufacturing has been really hit by the international uncertainties related to protectionism and also the slowdown in China and also the UK. One has to say that in the UK there has been a visible slowdown of investments, so the investments have come to a halt. Germany of course is a big exporter of investment goods, equipment goods and Germany has been hit already today by the Brexit-related uncertainties. So yes, I think the country is resilient. On the other hand, they're exposed to manufacturing. I think they can go through but it's of course a more delicate phase in the business cycle for them.  What about Italy?  Praet: Italy is another case. It's a different case. Italy is weak since a long time so Italy has a number of recessions before. They had I would say three recessions. They have a new recession now. I think it's a difficult case where you need really more structural reforms of course, but that's a different sort of situation.  Talk to me about risks: there is China, there is trade, you mentioned Brexit. What is your biggest concern?  Praet: Yes, well, the concerns in general are of political nature. I think the persistent character of all these uncertainties, and you listed a number of uncertainties, are weighing on economic sentiment and business sentiment in general. So you can say it's only for the persistence of these uncertainties, at some point have real effects. For a time, businesses continue their investment plans and it is business as usual but at some point it hits confidence and has real effects. That worries me indeed. It's about time that we reduced a little bit this political uncertainty  What can the ECB do to do that?  Praet: Well, there is so much that a central bank can do. We have a mandate which is price stability so we use the instruments we think are the best suited to reach our objective but it's only limited. If you get fundamental uncertainties related for example to the trade regime and the Brexit-related problems, the central bank cannot do much about this. It also needs to be supported by other policies in general.  Do you have anything specific in mind?  Praet: Well, I think it's time that this Brexit ends and I hope in a satisfactory and orderly way. That would probably restore confidence quickly if you do it in an orderly way. It could be the other way, but these things really sends very, very negative signals for everybody to say how is it possible to have so much uncertainty lasting so long about that issue. That's one example. The other examples in the trade sphere, it would be of course very good for confidence if the trade negotiations between US, China ended in a satisfactory way. Also we have uncertainties about the trade regime Europe is having with US, so these uncertainties really dent confidence. They have an impact on confidence and that's the worry.  The ECB have been working on a lending programme and I want to talk to you about timing. The announcement of the programme came a lot sooner than many people expected. The start of the programme will be somewhat later than people expected. Why is that?  Praet: Well, what we call the TLTRO, the funding for lending, is a very flexible instrument and there are many parameters in that instrument. What we have decided in the Governing Council is to disclose some of the parameters. First is the TLTRO is available; that means it's basically a funding instrument. So borrowers, banks will be able to borrow for two years up to two years. This is a funding side. It basically responds to the concerns that we have about congestion on the bond market, linked to two cliff effects; one cliff effect will be in June of next year, the other, March of the following year. That we have addressed. The other issue with the TLTRO is to what extent do you want to use it as an instrument to support lending conditions? That's the incentive scheme that you need to put in place. That's premature because you want to have more clarity about the evolution of the economy and the lending part that supports the economy. For the time being now we don't see anything special in terms of lending, banking intermediation to non-financial corporations or for households. Things are okay on that side. Of course the central bank pre-emptively has to look how the situation potentially will evolve and with the weakening of the economic growth you must be ready to act the instruments needed if you want to support lending. I would say in terms of pricing, for the TLTRO you want to first make an assessment; what is the pricing that corresponds the best to the problem you want to address? If it's lower lending at that time, the pricing has to take that into account. It's a bit premature now so we're going to decide in due time, as we say.  Can you translate due time? How much time do you have?  Praet: The first allotment will be in September of this year so you have to do it before. That will be decided maybe, I don't know, but maybe I will be gone. That means for the Governing Council of June, because we also will have the projections at that time. That would be one opportunity before September, but this being said, the Governing Council can always decide to change the incentive scheme of a programme. We did it in the past, given the evolution of the economy. We can do it in the future. As I said it's a very flexible instrument so you can do that, but it must be adapted to the problem you want to address, which is a monetary policy issue that you have to have in consideration.  You've talked to the banks about this tool in the past. Do you have any idea about take-up? What's your estimate?  Praet: Well, you see, the TLTRO-II is extremely advantageous for banks because they can borrow money at minus 40 basis points, so there is still a maturity of about one year. There is no incentive to go in a new one for a bank that could borrow at minus 40 except if you put the condition at minus 40, of course. But you see here, there is no need to rush for the banks. They maybe use it as a funding instrument but in terms of supporting lending for the time being, it's not the primary purpose; it's something we keep, we are aware of course of the slowdown of the economy, of the downside risk that we flag so that instruments can be designed and calibrated in a proper way when times come. That's a little bit what we have now, so the fact that the take-up for the September is far away, but for the September allotment it's not a major issue there because that's more a funding device. The question will be how you price it and what are the conditions of the pricing? That will depend on the assessment of the Governing Council about the lending conditions in general.  Now, we've talked about the risks to the economy. You've talked about what you've done so far and what's in the pipeline. If the Eurozone was heading for a recession, if the situation deteriorates significantly, what's actually left for the ECB to do?  Praet: We don't like to speak too much about the toolbox. There are many questions about the toolbox and they say, oh, what is this mysterious toolbox and all that? Once you start talking about something, you get a lot of speculative attitudes and speculation about what we do and how far you are going to go. You just say the path we always control that when we need to do something with our mandate, we find a way to do that. I think more realistically the situation which is more in probabilistic terms is an economy that will not recover in the coming quarters, because that's our scenario, and basically what you would see is an increase of credit spreads. You would see some impairment in the lending conditions, the standards would tighten. Then the appropriate instruments are for example the TLTRO and how the central bank can influence lending conditions. That's how the tiering discussions came back to see if at some point the conditions evolved in such a way that you see some impairments in the lending part or on the corporate bond markets. Then the central bank may wish to use some of these instruments. That's the context. Speculating about the big crisis, I think that's something I don't want to do.  Is QE still a possible tool?  Praet: Well, we say that all instruments are available, even new instruments are available; QE is of course available as we say, but I think it's needless. All the instruments are available as we said, even new instruments are possible, but I think it's not a time to speculate about this.  You are looking back to eight years at the ECB and I am just wondering, what was your worst possible day on the job?  Praet: I don't have a worst day at the ECB, really. I thought about these things, now that I'm reaching the end. I had difficult days, that yes, sometimes because of the sovereign debt crisis. I would say a worst day, you know what helps very much in difficult circumstances, and I must not complain; it's basically when you work in a group, in a team and it makes a whole difference. I had it all my life; also in the banking crisis in Belgium, it was sometimes extremely stressful. When you are in a team it changes totally the situation at least for me. I cannot speak about the worst day. If you really push me, the thing about the worst day, I would immediately say when there was less unity. You see, these are the situations where the stress goes up; because you feel that the team is disunited. Well, I don't see that really as a worst day because the team was in general, the team – that means the Governing Council – was very strong even for those having different opinions. There was a sense of unity in general in the Council, believe it or not, but that's how I feel.  Now, your successor is already known; Philip Lane from Ireland. Any preference as to who will replace Mario Draghi?  Praet: No, I have nothing to say on this. It was a fantastic cooperation with Mario, but that's for the others, that's for the politicians to decide.   "

Praet: Better understanding inflation dynamics, dealing with the lower bound and making policy within an incomplete monetary union #AskECB  How do you prepare for a monetary policy meeting? Do you talk to other governors to know their thoughts on monetary policy stance or do they all discover your recommendation the day of the meeting?  Praet:The Governing Council is a collegial body. My role is to present a thorough assessment of the economic situation and policy options. On that basis, we discuss and take our decisions #AskECB  are there plans to rebrand ECB to €CB?  Pra€t: No #AskECB  The #QE was ineffective, as only a small part of this #money made it to the real #economy. Even #inflation was too low. When you will implement the #helicopterMoney, which is more democratic and fair?   Praet: QE was very effective for the real economy. Lower interest rates have directly translated into lower bank lending rates for firms and households. This has meant more credit, more investment and more jobs (employment up by 10 million more since 2013) #AskECB  In your career at the ECB, was there ever a time when you screwed everything up, but no one ever found out it was you?  Praet: I don't think so #AskECB  What is your/ECB's opinion on bitcoin?   Praet: The technology behind it looks promising for many industries. But bitcoin is not money #AskECB  Hello! Where does the ECB stand now on negative rates? Has your view changed over time?   Praet: No, negative rates continue to be a powerful tool to reach our price stability objective. The side effects are outweighed by the positive effects on financing conditions for firms and households #AskECB  Why weren't you able to reach your inflation target, even with QE?   Praet: We are en route to reaching our inflation target. Getting there still requires the support of our monetary policy #AskECB  Any idea of what are you are going to do starting in June?  Praet: Start thinking about what I am going to do #AskECB  How much easier would your job be if there were no National Central Banks, and instead only the European Central Bank for the euro area?  Praet: National central banks are key for the good functioning of our monetary union, which is composed of 19 countries. In fact, without the NCBs our job would be much more difficult #AskECB  according to you, what are the topics in monetary economics that currently deserve more research ?  Praet: One is to better understand wage and price developments in the context of globalisation, the rising market power of some firms and digitalisation. Another one is the growing role of non-banks for monetary policy transmission #AskECB  Does the ECB see contagion risks for the EU due to problems in the China market?  Praet: It's not contagion, exactly. China is a major trading partner for us, so problems there will impact the demand for euro area goods and services, directly and indirectly #AskECB  1- Why ECB does not have any mandate to achieve an employment target? Is there any discussion at EU level to introduce that alongside the inflation target? 2- Central Banks now struggle to achieve inflation targets. Are globalization and growing inequalities key reasons?  Praet: I don’t think that a dual mandate would have changed our policies. All central banks, regardless of their specific mandates, are facing similar challenges and aim to maintain price stability #AskECB  The Euro has just turned 20. How to assess whether it bought more prosperity to European citizens ?  Praet: The euro has been a source of stability in a very turbulent environment. It is essential for the good functioning of the Single Market – the basis for our prosperity. That 75% of Europeans support the euro is telling #AskECB  Now that we know thar interest rates are going to remain at present levels at least until the end of 2019, could you clarify what month did you had in mind as a first live meeting for a hike when the phrase through the summer was used in the statement?   Praet: If we had had a specific month in mind, we wouldn’t have been shy about saying it #AskECB  with 1,5% inflation why you mantain negative rates? do you realize that it is a financial aberration and that maintaining this situation can be very harmful. hoy are hurting banks and savers.   Praet: Our policies are necessary for sustained convergence of inflation towards below, but close to 2% over the medium term. So far the benefits of our policies have outweighed negative side effects #AskECB  Why the @ecb is so in late, compared to a lot of #Centralbanks in the world, in the necessary process of the consolidation of the national public debt? You need to freeze or cancel the stock you have bought out like #UK #Centralbanks simply by pressing a button   Praet: What you suggest would be monetary financing (= financing government spending with central bank money). It is prohibited and would destroy the trust in the euro #AskECB  If you had one free wish, one Eurozone risk-sharing tool to choose, political feasibility aside, which one would it be?   Praet: Private risk-sharing is key but cannot work without some degree of public risk-sharing #AskECB  Where did you get the money for the QE?   Praet: As a central bank, we can create money to buy assets #AskECB  Are TLTROs like loanable funds for banks? How can the ECB ensure the traceability of TLTROs towards bank credit?  Praet: Yes, we trace the money bank by bank. Under TLTRO II only banks meeting a certain lending threshold get the most attractive conditions. Further details for TLTRO III will be communicated in due course #AskECB  Hi Peter Praet what are the top challenges to a Euro wide deposit insurance scheme?   Praet: The key issue is trust, which requires effort from all sides #AskECB  Will you miss me?  Praet: I am afraid I don’t know your work but you have piqued my curiosity and I will check it out. My colleagues in communications would also love to know: who posts these great pictures of the ECB every day? #AskECB  Why don't you print money (as you did with QE) to make investments, infrastractures, hospitals, to create jobs, to cut taxes, to enhance the public system?  Praet: It is up to governments, companies and households to take investment decisions. As a central bank, we can only influence the overall financing conditions of the economy #AskECB  Delphic or Odyssian?  Praet: Our forward guidance is both: We say that we expect rates to remain at their present levels “at least through the end of 2019” (=Odyssean) and “in any case for as long as necessary” (=Delphic) #AskECB  Do You like MMT, and why ?  Praet: The general idea that government debt can be financed by central banks is a dangerous proposition. In the past, this has resulted in hyperinflation and economic turmoil. That’s why central banks are independent  What's the thing that you are going to miss the most about being the Chief Economist for the ECB?   Praet: Collegiality. I would even say “l’esprit de camaraderie” – among my staff and fellow policy-makers. I will also miss the sense of humour of central bankers #AskECB  with a 2021 inflation forecast @ only 1,6%, do you think the ECB's stance is accommodative ? Could the ECB restart its APP were the inflation forecast to decrease further ?   Praet: We are confident that our current policy is appropriate to bring inflation back to our aim. At the last Governing Council meeting, we reiterated our determination to provide the monetary accommodation needed for a sustained convergence of inflation #AskECB  Dear Peter, because of the low interest rates it is easy as a youngster to lend money. However, if I look at the amount of wages that I need to pay for the average house, I fear that the house market is overheated. Are these valuations durable in the next 20 years?  Praet: Unfortunately I cannot answer your specific question. From a monetary policymaking perspective, even though there are pockets of very high prices, esp in cities, this cannot be addressed by monetary policy. It calls for local solutions – first and foremost macropru #AskECB  do you think this zealous approach to 2% inflation is a good goal to have considering it caused the ECB to raise interest rates in the middle of a recession?   Praet: I agree with you that you shouldn’t raise rates in the middle of a recession #AskECB  Is it time that central banks acknowledge the limits of their powers and persuade governments that fiscal policy must be more assertive in tackling Euro area's structural weaknesses?  Praet: Monetary policy remains effective but cannot be the only game in town #AskECB  Do you consider the changes in forward guidance and Tltro-III announced at the latest meeting a policy u-turn, as some observers argue, or rather just a slowdown in the process of monetary policy normalization?   Praet: No, they are a response to the downgrade of the economic outlook. Our latest decisions aim to maintain the accommodative policy stance necessary to reach our objective #AskECB  Has it ever been discussed what tie color should president Draghi use for the press conference? Is there a hidden code there?   Praet: Let’s not get tied up here. A clear no to both questions #AskECB Read the Q&A on Twitter   "
2019-03-11,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Corriere della Sera,"Interview of Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Danilo Taino on 7 March 2019 and published on 11 March 2019","  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview of Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Danilo Taino on 7 March 2019 and published on 11 March 2019  At its meeting on Thursday, 7 March, the ECB decided to add to the monetary stimulus already in place. What happened? Did the extent of the economic slowdown in the euro area take you by surprise?  The slowdown didn’t come as a surprise. Economic activity was exceptionally strong in 2017, thanks to global economic conditions. We knew that euro area growth would adjust towards its potential rate. The slowdown has been stronger than expected and started sooner, which motivated the decisions we took. But those decisions don’t represent a turnaround in our policy; they have been carefully calibrated to this diagnosis. We are adjusting to the new reality rather than reversing our course; we don’t see signs of a recession at present. The ECB staff projections have been revised. They previously envisaged that growth would be consistently above potential, which would have pushed inflation towards our objective of lower but close to 2%, whereas they now foresee that actual output will be initially equal to or below potential output, which means it will take longer for inflation to reach 2%.  In the event of external shocks, could the ECB go back to buying bonds on the market?  We don’t see the need. We are still seeing robust economic growth, although it’s less strong than before. It will take longer for inflation to reach our objective, but it will get there. We are reacting to the developments we have seen so far, so we will keep rates at zero for longer, we will continue to reinvest payments from maturing securities in our portfolio, and we will grant banks liquidity at favourable conditions provided that they finance the real economy. If you’re asking me about another asset purchase programme, all I will say is that this instrument is now part of our toolbox, but it is not needed now.  Do you think that European governments are pursuing appropriate fiscal policies under the circumstances?  It’s difficult for a central banker to give detailed advice on fiscal policy, since fiscal policy is a matter for democratically elected governments. What I can say generally is that the current fiscal stance in the euro area as a whole is slightly expansionary and supports economic activity. The European Commission has invited those countries that have fiscal space, such as Germany, to use it in the way they consider most appropriate for their economies. Those who don’t have any fiscal space shouldn’t use it or pretend to have it. This applies not just to Italy, but also to France. Both countries still have some way to go to rebuild their fiscal buffers.  Many market participants believe that Italy could be a source of crisis in Europe…  It’s not for me to talk about politics. But it’s true that, economically speaking, Italy is a in a difficult juncture. It is the only euro area country that is experiencing a technical recession. And it has not seen an improvement in the labour market, which is another thing that sets it apart from other euro area economies. In the longer term, Italy’s problem is well known: it is productivity growth. I don’t believe that any of this has to do with the euro, otherwise it would be a general problem across the euro area. The response is to focus on the country’s strengths, such as its small and medium-sized enterprises. And to use the Single Market to leverage their strength and help them export to global markets. Isolation and protectionism don’t work. Europe is an asset for our economies.  It seems to be difficult at the moment to undertake the much discussed reforms to complete the banking union and the capital markets union. Do you share this impression?  Yes, I do, and it’s a concern for the ECB. We firmly believe that Europe is part of the solution in dealing with the problems faced by European citizens. Many citizens in many countries are angry because economic results are not what they should be, because it has taken too long to recover from the financial crisis, because unemployment especially among the youth - is still high and because globalisation has not lived up to its promises, instead increasing inequality and marginalising parts of society. The measures needed to respond to these issues can only be effective at the European level. Not everything is working well in Europe and it begs a discussion. Italy, as a founding member of the EU and as the third economy of the euro area, needs to be part of it.  What do you think of the proposals for reform made by Macron?  I don’t want to comment on what the French President says. He has sparked a debate on the future of Europe, and every country should get involved. If European leaders focus only on domestic politics, this inward-looking attitude can only make Europe weaker.  A return to the previous era of globalisation without barriers is unlikely, isn’t it?  This is indeed unlikely. And that’s good news, since the reason we are experiencing problems today is that globalisation didn’t deliver on its promises. As Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa once said: “Those people who complain that we won’t get back to the pre-crisis path forget that it was the very path that led to that crisis”. We are currently undergoing a very disorderly transition and there is a temptation to turn to nationalist ideas, when one of the great successes to emerge in the aftermath of the Second World War was the creation of an international order based on trust. Change is needed; for instance, we were naive about opening up international financial flows. There was too much financial globalisation, and this led to volatility and systemic risk and it has eroded fiscal resources because multinationals have become footloose. To a certain extent, financial openness cancelled out the benefits of trade openness. We need to come up with a new international order that can overcome these problems. But returning to a system based on domestic priorities alone will clearly not work.  Don’t you think that central banks have been charged with too many roles and responsibilities?  Yes, I do. People expect too much from central banks, considering what we can do and the mandate they have given us in the first place. If you give a central bank too many objectives, you transform it from an apolitical entity with a narrow mandate into a political institution. We have a duty to deliver on our mandate, that is price stability. But giving us too many objectives would make us political, which we certainly don’t want to be.   "
2019-02-19,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Le Monde,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel on 13 February 2019","  Interview with Le Monde   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel on 13 February 2019  Is the ECB sufficiently well equipped to deal with the slowing European economy?  Yes. But remember that monetary policy cannot do everything – its primary objective is to maintain price stability, which contributes to a strong economy. However, fiscal policy and structural reforms also have a significant role to play in supporting economic activity. The ECB still has a large range of tools at its disposal, including advance communication about its strategy (forward guidance), reinvesting the debt securities it holds as they mature, and targeted lending to banks – the TLTROs. We are currently analysing the causes of the economic slowdown in Europe, some of which are temporary. We will not take a decision until we have conducted a thorough analysis.  What are the causes of this slowdown?  It is as much the result of international factors, which have weighed on exports – the slowdown of the global and Chinese economies, the risks of protectionism, market volatility, difficulties in some emerging markets – as it is the result of internal factors, like the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the tensions over the Italian budget at the end of last year. Of course, the ECB’s ability to influence external factors is limited. When dealing with the crisis, we didn’t hesitate to implement unconventional measures, such as net purchases of public and private debt (quantitative easing, or QE). In the light of the recovery, we stopped QE. But our rates are still low and our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for a long while yet, as we are going through a period of uncertainty.   How are you preparing for Brexit?   The United Kingdom leaving the EU is bad news for everyone, and for the UK economy in particular. We are participating in a working group with the Bank of England to analyse the various markets that could be affected, like the derivatives market and the market for insurance contracts. If there is an orderly Brexit, the effect on financial stability will be limited, as we think the private sector is sufficiently prepared. A disorderly Brexit, on the other hand, would represent a significant macroeconomic shock at a time when the European economy is already weakened. The UK’s GDP could shrink by up to 8%, according to the Bank of England. This would naturally affect the euro area economy. I hope we will avoid such a scenario.  Do the tensions over the populist Italian government’s budget risk sparking a new crisis in the euro area?  Following the agreement in December between the Italian government and the European Commission on the Italian budget, the country’s borrowing costs fell. This confirms that, when a country follows the common rules, its efforts go down well with the markets. Italy’s main challenge at the moment is its weak growth; this has been the case for several years now. Rome must urgently implement structural reforms in order to increase its growth potential by resolving its productivity issues, regaining competitiveness and targeting internal weaknesses.  How much have the political uncertainties already cost the euro area in terms of growth?  It is very hard to measure this precisely, as it is very difficult to incorporate certain variables, like confidence and business sentiment, into macroeconomic models. Nonetheless, for the past six to nine months protectionism has been the main risk at the international level, and one of the major sources of market volatility. It is essential that the United States and China, as well as the EU, find common ground so that these tensions don’t devolve into a trade war that would be harmful to everyone.  Why is inflation still struggling to recover in the euro area?  The situation in the job market has improved considerably in the euro area. Nine million jobs have been created since the crisis and the unemployment rate has fallen below 8%. Compensation per employee is also recovering. What matters is knowing when this increase will translate into a pickup in underlying inflation, which excludes the most volatile product prices, like energy prices. We are confident that it will pick up within a few months or quarters. Even if energy prices were to fall a little in the coming months, we are confident that inflation will, over the medium term, converge towards our aim of below, but close to, 2%.  For several months now, political leaders’ criticisms of central bank independence have been growing, in Europe and, above all, in the United States. Does that worry you?  In recent decades, the independence of central banks has proven extremely effective in maintaining price stability. Political and economic agendas are very different. When monetary institutions act under the influence of political leaders, they run the risk of making serious mistakes that harm economic activity. Very often, the threats made against their independence are part of populist rhetoric, which regularly proposes simple, magical solutions to complex problems. While these solutions may seem appealing, they are rarely correct.  Why has the ECB not used debt purchases to support more directly the ecological transition or the fight against inequality?  The ECB and the euro area national central banks have purchased many green bonds, both public and private, within the framework of their asset purchase programme, while ensuring that their purchases are conducted in a market-neutral manner. Furthermore, these asset purchases and the other measures taken by the ECB in recent years have been the main source of support for the economic recovery and the fall in unemployment in the euro area. All the studies we have carried out show that job creation is the main lever for reducing inequality.  Many people feel that the EU is not doing enough to protect them from globalisation. Are they right?   Despite national concerns on the subject, the recovery in the euro area is bearing fruit. It is creating jobs, and people are taking note of that. By way of evidence, recent surveys show that almost 80% of people in the euro area have confidence in the euro. Few political parties can boast such support! And this confirms that the Member States are stronger together than they are alone when it comes to dealing with globalisation.   Were you surprised by the “gilets jaunes” movement in France?  To a degree, yes, because France is one of the most egalitarian countries in Europe in terms of income distribution. But other factors have played a role.  Wouldn’t it be more sensible for us to adjust to permanently weak growth rather than constantly seeking to raise GDP?  It’s true that demographic trends in Europe are not very favourable for growth. But that shouldn’t stop us from implementing reforms that aim to boost growth in the long term.  At the euro area level, we need to complete the banking union and the fiscal instrument that is essential to be able to stabilise the economy when there is a downturn. We also need to achieve greater integration, for example by encouraging the creation of cross-border banks. And that requires us to further harmonise legislation, and to pursue greater consolidation in the sector, even though banks are now much better capitalised and much more resilient than they were ten years ago.   Isn’t money laundering a more urgent issue that needs tackling? Several European credit institutions, such as Danske Bank, Denmark’s largest bank, have recently been hit by scandal…  Yes, it’s a major issue that has been brought to the fore by several very serious cases. The ECB doesn’t have a mandate in this area, but the European Commission has taken action to strengthen the cooperation between the various national anti-money laundering authorities under the auspices of the European Banking Authority. This is the first step, and more needs to be done to achieve greater centralisation in this area.   "
2019-02-18,Peter Praet,Interview with Börsen-Zeitung,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Detlef Fechtner and Mark Schrörs on 11 February 2019 and published on 18 February 2019","  Interview with Börsen-Zeitung   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Detlef Fechtner and Mark Schrörs on 11 February 2019 and published on 18 February 2019  Mr Praet, how badly is the euro area economy doing?  We have lately seen a marked increase in the risks for the euro area economy. That is why we revised our assessment at the last meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council in January. We see the constellation of risks surrounding the economic outlook, in other words the balance of risks, as tilted to the downside. That is a significant change in our communication and reflects concerns about the general economic situation. At the same time, however, we said that our baseline scenario has so far remained intact. In March we will have new macroeconomic projections from ECB staff and we will then re-examine our assessment.   The December projections for 2019 to 2021 forecast growth of 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.5% and a gradual rise in inflation to 1.8% in 2021 – so approaching the ECB’s target rate of below, but close to, 2%. That surely can’t be upheld now, can it?  I expect that the projections for the near term, in particular, will be revised downwards. The data since December have been much weaker than I had expected. But our discussion in the ECB’s Governing Council does not focus so much on the short-term perspective. The medium-term perspective is decisive for us, most especially the question of whether we are dealing with a temporary soft patch or with a more prolonged weakness.  And your response, particularly in view of the continuing weak data since the last Governing Council meeting?  First of all, the data since the January meeting have not only held negative surprises, they have also contained a few positive signs such as the further decline in unemployment. But it’s also true that growth in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 and most likely also in the first quarter of 2019 is well below the potential growth rate of the euro area economy. So growth will have been below potential for three consecutive quarters and that’s not good news. The question now is whether there will be a rebound in the second quarter and beyond. A rebound is likely, but it is too early to say by how much.  So would you say that the ECB’s Governing Council is becoming less confident that we are now merely seeing a temporary economic dip?  The economic slowdown is broader and more persistent than had been thought and growth in the short term is likely to fall short of previous expectations. But as I said, what counts for us is the medium-term outlook and we see positive and negative factors there.   What does that mean in practice?  On the positive side, the situation for households and so for consumption is still favourable. That is a key driver of growth. Employment is still increasing and wages are picking up, boosting disposable income. Lower oil prices are also strengthening purchasing power. The fiscal stance has become slightly more expansionary in the euro area as a whole. That is not a major development, but it helps a little. Euro area non financial firms are doing well too. Of course there are still some weak spots in the corporate sector and these pose some risk. But all in all, corporate balance sheets are in good shape. So they have the capacity to invest. But there is indeed a negative side too.   And what’s on that side?  The biggest problem by far is that political uncertainties have been persisting for so long now – whether they are related to protectionism, to Brexit, etc... The more time passes, the greater their likely negative impact on the economy. In the context of persistent uncertainties, additional shocks can have large effects on the economy. The uncertainties are already tempering business confidence more severely than expected. The state of the UK economy shows the damage that can occur when uncertainty persists for too long. Investment in the United Kingdom has fallen sharply. It is high time to put an end to these uncertainties in a positive way.   Is your main concern for the euro area economy also to do with firms’ readiness to invest?  The uncertainties are increasingly affecting business confidence in the euro area and are likely to affect investment in 2019. If confirmed, this would be bad news for the European economy that needs investment following years of underinvestment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Moroever, the question is how the financial sector would react.  What exactly do you mean by that?  The financial sector often tends to act procyclically. Banks are a case in point, because they tend to amplify cyclical developments. When the economy is performing well, they are willing to grant credit, but when it is faltering, they are not so keen.   Do you see such a risk at present?  As far as the capital markets are concerned, credit risk premia have increased significantly over the past months – for both high and low credit-rated firms. That tightens borrowing conditions for firms on capital markets and weighs on the economy. On the other hand we have so far not seen any such tightening in bank lending conditions in the euro area. Overall, in light of these developments, we consider that the probability of a recession remains low.  But are you worried that that will change, that the banks will tighten conditions too?   Banks in the euro area now hold much more capital than before and are better able to withstand shocks. They also have larger liquidity buffers. That’s all good news. At the same time, bank equity prices have fallen sharply and profitability is often very low, as is also reflected in the banks’ very low price-to-book ratio of around 50%. In such a context there is a risk that the banks could act even more procyclically than they usually do and would amplify the cycle. To be clear, the uncertainties and the economic slowdown have so far not caused banks to tighten their lending conditions or to grant less credit. But we need to keep a very close eye on how this evolves. How will the banks behave if the economic slowdown continues?   Would you say that financing conditions in the euro area as a whole have already tightened significantly?  Financing conditions have tightened somewhat in recent months, but not significantly, thanks in part to our forward guidance on interest rates. This partly compensates for such effects. But you’re absolutely right, we as central bankers must always ask ourselves whether our monetary policy stance is appropriate for us to attain our objective.   And what is your answer at the moment?   We have revised our assessment of risks to growth downward. I would say that is a clear indication that the level of alert is higher than before.   Three quarters of below-potential growth, higher risks and at least slightly tighter financing conditions – what does that signify for the inflation outlook? Is the ECB’s Governing Council losing its confidence in reaching the target of 2% over the medium term?  Three quarters of below-potential growth are certainly not good news. But we have a medium term perpective. At our last monetary policy meeting, we upheld the assessment that inflation will converge to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Wages are picking up at a pace that is more or less in line with expectations from our models. One thing that has not worked out as expected is the transmission to consumer prices. This pass-through is not working in line with projections. We are analysing this very carefully. But we remain confident that it will eventually do so; we need to be patient and persistent.   But what if the economic outlook deteriorates further and more permanently?   In our baseline scenario, capacity utilisation will remain high and firms will be in a position to pass higher wages through to higher prices. That would be more difficult if growth remained below potential. Downside risks to growth could then lead to downside risks to inflation in the medium term. We are not at that stage yet, but this will be an important discussion point at the next meetings of the ECB’s Governing Council.   But if the outlook becomes gloomier, what will happen then? Will the ECB’s Governing Council be even more careful in continuing on its cautious path towards monetary policy normalisation or could there be another turn towards more easing?   I have never spoken about a normalisation of our monetary policy stance. I have always referred to a normalisation of our instruments. There is a big difference. After the end of our net asset purchases, the primary instrument to steer our monetary policy stance is again our key interest rates. And as far as their path is concerned, we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This rotation of instruments from net purchases to the rate path has been implemented in such a way as to preserve our accommodative monetary policy stance. We have thus not tightened our monetary policy. Moreover, we have made it clear that, in any event, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards our inflation aim in a sustained manner.   President Mario Draghi always stresses that the toolbox is full. But with interest rates at or even below zero and the asset purchase programme at its self-imposed limits, what else is really left?  If there is a problem, there needs to be a careful assessment to establish the cause. A financial shock, for instance, is something different from a slowdown in growth for fundamental reasons. In the case of an economic slowdown, interest rates are generally the instrument of choice. If the euro area economy were to slow more sharply, we could adapt our forward guidance on interest rates and this could be complemented by other measures. But one thing is clear: the ECB’s Governing Council will always find ways and means of acting if it needs to. In case we would cease to be confident that inflation is converging to a level that is below, but close to, 2%, it would be our mandate to act.  As a result of the weaker economic data, market participants have shifted their expectations for a first interest rate hike from autumn 2019 to, in some cases, well into 2020 – despite the Governing Council’s unchanged outlook that interest rates will remain at their current levels “at least through the summer of 2019”. Do you feel comfortable with that?  First of all, it shows that our forward guidance is effective. Our forward guidance on key interest rates has both a calendar-based – “at least through the summer of 2019” – and a state-contingent leg – “and in any case for as long as necessary”. The shift in market expectations reflects the state-contingent leg of our forward guidance. Of course there will be a point in time when the calendar-based leg of our forward guidance will be discussed and, if needed, adapted. We have been very careful so far not to validate market expectations.  And at your meeting on 7 March – will that still be too early?  I can’t say at this stage.   Would new net asset purchases also be an option in an emergency?  Asset purchases are part of our current toolbox, President Draghi has been clear about that. But that doesn’t mean that they are the preferred option in current conditions. And it should be said that if forward guidance on interest rates is credible and steers expectations in the desired direction, further purchases may not be needed at all to ensure that financing conditions are appropriate.  Observers increasingly expect the ECB to launch new longer-term refinancing operations for banks – TLTROs – and they make the case that this measure, especially in conjunction with an increase in the deposit facility rate, could improve the situation for banks and support lending. What would you say to that, especially in the light of your concerns about the procyclical behaviour of banks?  Our TLTROs have been a very useful tool to deal with impairments in the transmission of monetary policy and are part of our toolbox. As the procyclical behaviour of banks is an important reason why economic cycles sometimes end badly, we do need to monitor the transmission of monetary policy through the banking system carefully. In March we will make an assessment of the current and expected state of bank transmission.   You will be leaving the ECB at the end of May, having experienced and helped to shape a period of great change at the ECB. Do you think that zero and negative interest rates, forward guidance and extensive asset purchases are the “new normal” for central banks, including the ECB, or can there ever be a return to the old regime that existed before the global financial crisis?  A return to greater normality will certainly take a long time. We are very cautious at the ECB about estimates of the natural rate of interest…  … meaning the rate at which growth and inflation are in equilibrium…  … but there doesn’t seem to be any doubt that this rate, for reasons including demographics and technological progress, is now lower than it used to be. And that also means that the likelihood of reaching the lower bound on interest rates is much greater than previously thought. Then other tools are needed.   As the Federal Reserve did after the global financial crisis, does the ECB need to have a fundamental debate about its mandate, its objectives and its strategy, especially since the last review, in 2003, was more than 15 years ago?  The mandate is of course out of questions, it is enshrined in the Treaty. However after the experience of the past few years, it may also make sense for the ECB to review its overall monetary policy framework in the future. But now may not be the right time. Our strategy has a medium-term orientation, which gives us more room for manoeuvre. And with our two-pillar strategy, with the monetary analysis, we also look closely at aspects of financial stability. Financial cycles have become increasingly important. I think that our framework has strengths that we should preserve.  Central bank independence is increasingly coming under attack around the world – not just in the United States, but also in Italy, for example. How much does that worry you?  The independence of central banks is of key importance and should not be called into question. Whatever the criticism may be, every other regime in which the central bank is closer to the finance ministry is much worse than the current system.  But not everybody seems to agree.  There may be populists who dream of something different. But most politicians are very conscious of the need to keep monetary and fiscal policy separate. Any other approach can quickly turn dangerous.   "
2019-02-07,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Barron’s,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Pierre Briançon on 5 February 2019 and published on 7 February 2019","  Interview with Barron’s   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Pierre Briançon on 5 February 2019 and published on 7 February 2019  Why did the European Central Bank both warn against increased risks for the eurozone economy and choose to do nothing at its last meeting?  At this stage, we don’t think that we have enough elements to conclude that we’re facing a lasting and serious slowdown of the eurozone economy. That said, we have a duty of transparency, we have to communicate on the way we see the economy. Forward guidance implies that you’re being honest on the risks ahead. Hence our conclusion that risks have moved to the downside.  And these elements are?  The slowdown itself is not a surprise. Growth in 2017-18 was fast, boosted by world trade and somewhat artificially by the US fiscal stimulus, and we knew this was not sustainable. What we’re seeing now is that the slowdown may be broader and longer-lasting than originally forecast. That’s mostly due to the uncertainty linked to a possible slowdown of emerging economies, especially China, and another source of uncertainty created by the tense trade relationship between the United States and China, and in general between the United States and the rest of the world. We don’t see increased risks mainly coming from within Europe at the moment.  If the risks are piling up, why not act more aggressively?  You must remember that the mere fact of changing our communication by itself triggers some monetary easing. Because we changed our vision of the risks ahead, markets drew their conclusions and the eurozone yield curve is flatter than it was in December. Markets that were anticipating our first rate hike in January now see it coming in May/June 2020, whereas we have said that we expect our rates to remain at their present low levels at least through the summer of 2019. So communication is in itself a monetary policy instrument. If we have to do more, it will have to be based on data.  Is what you call your “tool box” of monetary instruments complete now? Or would you have to invent new ones?  We are now well equipped to face many different types of situations. As of today, we have interest rates at the zero level, or even negative for our deposit facility. Our net purchases of bonds stopped in December but we will keep reinvesting the proceeds and keep our balance sheet as it is for now, so quantitative easing hasn’t stopped. We have long-term liquidity operations which could be used again if necessary. And we even have instruments that were announced but have never been used. But even with all this, if we were facing new situations in the future, I’m confident we could be creative again and come up with efficient instruments, all within our legal mandate.  You didn’t mention no-deal Brexit among the risk factors?  That is definitely a material risk for the near future, but for now it’s not an explanation of the current worsening slowdown. The anxiety and pessimism we see is due to the global factors I mentioned. That said, we’ve worked a lot with the Bank of England to minimise the possible consequences of a no-deal Brexit, and our joint conclusion is that most of the risk in financial services could be handled by the market players themselves, save for the derivatives clearing question. But that question has now been dealt with by legal assurances given by the European Commission for the next year.  Do you feel the Bank of England and the ECB can continue to cooperate smoothly, whatever the Brexit scenario?  I have no doubt about this in both dimensions of our activities – monetary policy and banking supervision. Our dialogue is very intense, very close. In the case of no-deal Brexit, keeping that confidence will be essential to manage the situation.  Were you surprised by the change of guidance of the Federal Reserve, hinting that rate hikes might be delayed? Does that complicate your task?  I won’t comment on the Fed’s decision and communication. Let me point out that the US economy is likely at the end of a cycle, and this is a moment that is always difficult for markets in their search for information. That’s not the case in Europe, where we are lagging in terms of recovery and where the normalisation of monetary policy is only beginning. The second element to keep in mind is that the nature of the risks we’re all facing today is fundamentally political: trade negotiations, relations between the United States and China, Brexit, the political situation in emerging countries, and even some political developments in Europe. Putting a price on political risk is something markets don’t do well. It’s not business as usual where you run your models and you crunch your data. It’s less quantifiable. So markets turn to central banks to seek some reassurance on what lies ahead.  Do you have the feeling that among the political risks you mention could be various threats to the independence of central banks?  That’s not my impression. The importance of independent central banks is well understood. But there may be some tensions, because there may be a level of expectation for central banks that is too high after years of financial crisis. There may be a temptation to make central banks responsible for things that governments should address through fiscal policy, for example. Just because central banks had to invent new monetary policy tools to face unexpected shocks in the last decade doesn’t mean they can do everything. It’s very important for central bankers to refrain from hubris. Central bankers are technocrats with narrow mandates; the counterpart of their authority is that they strictly abide by their mandates. Ours is to maintain price stability. Some things we shouldn’t and can’t do, for example redistributive policies, or tackling our economies’ productivity slowdown.  Market operators wonder about what will happen to Europe’s monetary policy once Mario Draghi is gone next November. How much does continuity matter here?  Our own monetary policy committee is the 25-strong Governing Council. Just like the Fed, and contrary to other central banks, we have many people taking part in the decision, so that in and of itself is an element of continuity. Most of our decisions in recent years have been taken unanimously, or by large consensus. The President has an important role, of course, but the overall approach and philosophy of the ECB is unlikely to change at the end of the year.  Some European politicians deplore that the lack of speedy progress on eurozone reform means that the monetary union is ill-equipped to face another potentially serious shock. Do you share their pessimism?  Ever since the euro’s creation we’ve had economists predicting the end of the euro for the next year, and it’s still here. And investors know by now that it’s always a mistake to underestimate the strength of the European project. It is a long-term political construction. It being political doesn’t mean it is easy, and it has both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, it means that it is resilient when tested by short-term economic shocks. On the other hand, that means that any new integration steps involve a political process that must be approved by 27 governments, subject to local and national political interests. That involves slowness and procrastination, but the result is robust. Even after the crisis we have lived through, which has deeply scarred our economic and social fabric, the level of public support for the euro is at its highest in 20 years. That should be the basis for further progress.   "

The British now want to reopen negotiations on the Irish issue but the European Union has already said that it was not willing to. To an outside observer it looks like quite a shambles. How do you feel about what's going on in London right now?   Well, for a start I deeply regret the British people's decision to leave the EU. That's my basic emotion. Simply because I believe that we will only retain influence in the global arena if we stick together in the EU. It pains me that the British think, mistakenly in my view, that going their own way will give them more options when making future arrangements.   Many people are now afraid that Brexit will be the beginning of the end for Europe. Does this worry you too?   Of course it worries me, because I'm such a firm believer in Europe and in the benefits that it brings. But I am basically an optimist and I think that Brexit has in fact brought the other countries closer together.   But the United Kingdom is not an isolated case. There are nationalist movements in some other European countries too.   Yes, I think they will always reappear and will continue to exist simply because a certain group of people will be very unhappy or discontented. There are people who feel helpless and think that retreating to their regional, national domain will give them more options and more control over their own lives.   Where do you think this helplessness comes from?   My view is that, in itself, globalisation offers extensive advantages, but it naturally has disadvantages too and it does not centre around people; at the end of the day it centres around economic ties. And that makes some people, those who are probably not the winners from globalisation, feel helpless. Yes, and perhaps it makes them more aggressive. This feeling of helplessness then leads people to believe that they would have more scope in a national or regional setting. That is why we need to do more to explain what advantages Europe brings, for each and every one of us, and what prosperity. We must again emphasise how important it is to have peace and that Europe is a major reason why we have enjoyed peace for so many years now.   You were born in 1964, for your grandparents’ generation, was the war a topic...  ...that was very much alive.   ...did your family talk about it?   Not with my grandparents, but with my parents. My mother was with her sister and my grandmother in Dresden when it was bombed. They were the only ones to come out of the cellar alive.  That was obviously something we talked about. Something very important. We also talked a lot about what happened after 1945, how my mother had suffered from terrible hunger. She had lost her father and the three women had to get by on their own. Yes, that was an extremely important topic in our family. My parents came from East Germany, from Saxony and Thuringia, and both escaped over the border. Perhaps I have a very particular background in that sense.    You are clearly a genuinely committed European. You've taken a pro-European stance since, and I think this is really interesting, you were a young woman living in the United States of all places. You spent a year there as an exchange student. What happened there that made such an impression on you?   First of all, that year made a big impression on me as regards tolerance, because I felt what it was like to be a foreigner. I was a foreigner for a year and I had to constantly justify why I held a different opinion. One of my subjects at school was called “discussion and debate”. During those special classes I joined the US pupils in learning how to discuss and debate issues, for one hour a day, five days a week. It was the early 1980s and the teacher took full advantage of a European's presence in her class. So every day, for a whole year, I stood up alone and defended European ideas, European values. I lived in the Bible belt, the extremely conservative states in the middle of the United States, and defended our European values every day.   So Europe is a driving force in your personal life in any case. Is it also a driving force for you as a member of the ECB's Executive Board?   That is my job. It would be appalling if it were any other way.   And Brexit? That's an important issue for you now, isn't it?   There are several major issues, but yes, Brexit is one of them. As a banking supervisor, I deal with it on a daily basis as we are making preparations. Brexit will make certain things in the financial market more difficult. There will be banks that also need to have a licence here, for example. That is all part of our day-to-day work. But as far as the ECB's remit is concerned, we feel that we have prepared ourselves as much as we can.   At the ECB meeting in Frankfurt last week, ECB President Mario Draghi took a rather pessimistic view of the future and spoke of mounting risks for the economy. Looking at what the experts are saying, a disorderly Brexit could have serious consequences for Germany and for Europe. There are some horror scenarios: chaos at the borders, collapsing exports, job losses. What is your most serious concern?   I can only give a reasonably good assessment for the financial markets. And as I said, we are very well prepared. We will never be able to predict what the different market participants will do on the anticipated Brexit starting date.   You don't have a crystal ball?   Of course not, and if anyone claimed that they knew what was going to happen, I would be very wary.   Your term as banking supervisor at the ECB expires in February, after five years. You were born in Stuttgart, Ms Lautenschläger, studied law in Bonn and could perhaps have become a lawyer or a judge. Why did you, as a lawyer, feel drawn to the world of banking and finance of all things?   I have always been interested in economic connections. But I will openly admit that I did not consciously study with a view to becoming a banking supervisor.   That's a relief!  To be honest, there was a vacancy and I applied for it.   Throughout your career, the role of supervisor emerges as a leitmotif even before you joined the ECB in 2014. You worked for the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, and then became Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank where you were also responsible for banking supervision. What do you find so sexy in supervising banks?   Well, it is sexy, let's be honest!   I don't get it. But I'd like to understand.   That may take a while.   In a nutshell...   You're working in an area in which not everything is governed by rules down to the last detail. So you can be creative. You work in an area in which your counterparty is highly innovative. I've been doing that now for almost 25 years but I learn new things every day. Every day brings new challenges and every morning you are asked questions that you don't yet know the answer to. And when you leave the office in the evening, you do know some of the answers that you didn't know that morning.   And you find that appealing?  Yes, that is truly delightful. You're dealing with people for much of the time – if you don't like confrontation, you're in the wrong place. You have to show that you're assertive, that you can say no, that you will keep on asking precise questions about certain things and will not be satisfied with vague answers. So you do need to have a certain kind of personality to feel comfortable in that role.   You've experienced some turbulent times, including the financial crisis in 2008. As Head of Supervision at the BaFin you had a crucial role in the crisis negotiations on the German side. Your job probably wasn't so much fun for you then. What affect did that experience have on you?   In times of crisis the learning curve is especially steep and it does have an impact, I can tell you. You learn an incredible amount about political connections and political constraints.   You're raising your eyebrows as you say that.   Everyone has their own personal experience. You're right, though, at that moment, in that particular case, it wasn't much fun. But it does make you stronger and you come out of it with your own set of “lessons learned"".   So what were the most important lessons that you learned from the crisis?   Oh, I learned many lessons from it. I'm not sure if it's possible to name the most important one. We supervisors – and I think also the market participants, politicians and legislators – definitely learnt that markets are far more interconnected than we had thought.   At the time we all clearly saw that a single domino could set off a whole chain reaction.   Exactly. We saw that banks must take liquidity far more seriously. Supervision has its own distinct business cycle. After the crisis, supervisors are given many powers and large numbers of staff. But then it tapers off, and it becomes increasingly difficult to push things through.   Would you say that your experiences during the financial crisis have made you a tad tougher and more strict?   Oh yes, definitely.  Ms Lautenschläger, this is our interview box, we always use it in our interviews. I'll pass it over to you. For each guest we have on the programme, we put something appropriate into this box. Would you like to open it?   Ah! Boxing gloves?   Yes, small boxing gloves that you can hang on your car mirror.   Lovely, thank you.   They're a fitting gift for you, aren't they?   Yes.  Could you sometimes use such boxing gloves when dealing with bank managers?   But don't boxing gloves actually soften the blows? They probably wouldn't be suitable...but I wouldn't only think of them in connection with bank managers. But simply..  So you would prefer to be bare-fisted?   No, I prefer transparency, in the first instance, and precise instructions. And I think if you're working in a kind of authority, i.e. with the competence to take administrative measures – sorry, but I am a lawyer, after all – you must give precise instructions. You should not be vague, but that doesn't have to be forbidding. The underlying tone does not have to be nasty; the message must simply be very clear: That is not good enough. You have to remedy the issue. I will give you a certain period of time in which to do so, otherwise.... And I think that every supervisor needs to have that capacity if they want to succeed.   Staying with the boxing metaphor for the moment, could we say that you had to fight your way up from modest beginnings.   No, I would not say that.  Your father was a pastry chef?  Yes, my father is a pastry chef. My mother was a waitress. So, in that sense, I suppose it's fair to speak of modest beginnings.   What kind of upbringing did you have?   I was brought up in the firm belief that I could do anything if I put my mind to it. My parents set great store by me having the good education that they never had themselves.   There's something else for you in the box, could you take another look? You see I figured that stress tests for banks were part and parcel of your job as ECB banking supervisor. But if we turn the tables, are there any stress tests for the supervisor? There aren't any, are there?  Oh yes there are! Every stress test for the bank is also a stress test for the supervisor.   Ok, but I've nonetheless prepared a few very special stress cards for you in order to test your personal stress resilience. Please go ahead and read out the first card.   It reads: “Your office manager calls in sick.”   Do you find that stressful?   Yes, in the first instance. But then I would simply put their calls through to me and get on with it.   So you would really do that?   Yes, of course I would. I'm a woman. I’m well able to multitask.   The next stress card.   It reads: “Someone hacks into your work computer which stores important sensitive bank data.”  How would you react?  I think that's actually impossible. We have an extremely good security system at the ECB. You want to know how I would react?  That would surely be a stress factor, wouldn't it. Confidential data?   Yes, of course. But our IT experts would deal with it, and our colleague from Communications would probably step in too and would then speak to you. It has never once happened to me, by the way.  Next card. It reads: “You need to fly to an important meeting, but the pilots go out on strike unexpectedly.” That has actually happened to me. That can happen occasionally and then you ask...  You take that in your stride?   Yes, exactly, I would then return to the office and ask my staff to arrange a conference call. That is easily done these days.   A video conference or something like that?   Yes, that's right.   We've one more card, if you'd like to take it?  Yes! It reads: “You need to get to an Executive Board meeting at the ECB but you're surrounded by a group of Blockupy demonstrators as you enter the building.”   Is your heart racing?   Well, I assume that the demonstrators pose no threat to life and limb, they simply want to make their views known, don't they?   Yes.  Well, I'm in my element if I can put forward my side of the argument. As I mentioned, that one hour a day...  ... in the debating club.   The debating club, exactly. Of course my heart would race if my life was in danger.   In the past, the ECB was repeatedly the butt of criticism, ranging from the zero interest rate policy to the purchase of government bonds of indebted countries. Do you ever have any doubts about your own role?   Well, I think that if you never questioned your own role you would not be the right person for the job. For each and every one of the decisions we take, I naturally ask myself: What is my task? What interests are at stake? What is my statutory mandate? For the ECB, the mandate is to preserve price stability. As banking supervisor, other things come into play such as contributing to financial stability and that's what I do every day. I ask myself: given this mandate, this task, what do you think is the best way forward? In many cases, I then agree with the decision taken by the majority in the ECB, but I sometimes think that other decisions would be better.   So you are quite self-critical?  Yes, of course. At any rate, I hope I am. I mean, one should never say that about oneself, but of course I question myself.   Let me sum up. I think you've mastered the stress test very well. I would say that you’ve passed.  Thank you!   The stress test for banks, which is also part of your daily business, does look a bit different in terms of content, though. You test how susceptible banks are to crises, such as a real estate bubble bursting somewhere, the economy falling apart or unemployment going up. How are European banks faring right now? What is your assessment?  The banking sector in Europe is now much more robust. We have seen to it that banks have to hold more capital, more liquidity. We are taking a very intensive look at risk management, at governance within the banks, and we are asking them to make improvements. So, European banks are now more crisis-resistant, that’s certain.  But when you conducted the last stress test two months ago, in November, which involved 48 banks from 15 European countries, it’s true that none of the banks failed, but the German banks, for example, came out somewhere in the middle. You can’t be satisfied with that, can you?  Well, someone has to be in the middle, of course – not all 48 banks can be top of the list. But again, to be clear, a great deal has been done in the last five years to make European banks more robust, more crisis-resistant. That doesn’t mean that everyone has done all their homework or that we can sit back and say that everything is perfect now. Incidentally, that’s never the case for banking supervisors, because banks have to deal with the economic environment in which they find themselves. Banks are also a mirror image of the economy in which they operate. You just mentioned the specific case of German banks. It must be said that we have a very high number of banks facing a great deal of competition in Germany, and profit margins are very, very low. If you look at other countries, it’s very clear that it’s much easier for their banks to make a profit.  What do you think of the idea of banks merging, of banks that are in poor health hoping that a merger will help them to survive? Do you think that is a good way forward?  There needs to be consolidation in the European banking sector, including Germany, because we are “overbanked”, meaning that we have too many banks. I don’t know if it is still the case, but five years ago we had more bank branches than bakeries in Germany. If I could set up the banking world of my dreams, I would like it to be diversified, with small, medium and large banks, some of them operating at the regional level and others at the national level. But I would also like there to be banks that could support the European real economy in its operations abroad. I would like German firms to get from German or European banks the services they need to be able to conduct business in Asia, the United States and South America.  In your business it is not just about ensuring that banks are able to withstand a crisis, it is also about the negative image that the whole sector acquired during the financial crisis. And for many people that has led to an abiding loss of trust, and most of all to the feeling that taxpayers’ money was used to save banks. Can you guarantee that nothing like that could ever happen again?  I am convinced that the likelihood has fallen, because we have more capital, more liquidity and better risk management. But I would never say “never”. I would never say that there will never be a crisis again. The links in various markets to possible collapses beyond our sphere of influence – beyond Europe, for example – could of course also affect financial stability in Europe. And in that case the European banking sector would definitely be more robust than what we saw in 2008. But I would never want to claim that there won’t be another crisis.  Your term as Vice-Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board comes to an end in a few weeks. The term of Mario Draghi, ECB President, finishes at the end of the year. Isn’t it about time for there to be a woman at the top? Would you be interested in applying for the job?  Quite honestly, I don’t see myself as ECB President. And I also wouldn’t reduce it to the leveI of “it should be a man or a woman”. It should be somebody who is capable of taking on this position of great responsibility. And if that person happened to be a woman, then I would of course be glad.  Thank you, Sabine Lautenschläger.  Thank you.   "
2019-01-25,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Bloomberg TV,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua on 25 January 2019","  Interview with Bloomberg TV   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua on 25 January 2019  Benoît Cœuré, the ECB executive board member, joins us right here in Davos. Thank you so much, Mr Cœuré, for joining us.  Good morning.  You flew in after the news conference in Frankfurt yesterday. Overall we heard President Draghi talk about these risks to the downside, but how would you explain it in your words? Why did we not foresee this?  We did foresee it, actually. The tone of our discussion yesterday was acknowledging that there is quite a lot of uncertainty around, that a lot of the uncertainty is political, has political sources and, first and foremost, global trade which is a politically-engineered uncertainty. We knew that growth would have to slow down because it started from very high points back in 2017-18. But the slowdown has surprised us. We have been surprised. We have to be very careful to monitor the data and that’s what we’re doing now. We are analysing the data, trying to understand what’s going on, and in particular what we have to understand is the persistence of this shock to eurozone growth. I would say: today the jury’s still out.  When you talk about a shock to eurozone growth, how much of it is actually trade and how much of it is actually internal slowdown?  A lot of it is trade. A lot of it comes from the outside. The Governing Council has said for months that most of the downside risks come from the outside. Until yesterday we had said risks were balanced or they were moving to the downside. Now, we say they have moved to the downside because these risks to global trade have materialised.  What about Brexit?  First, the ECB is not part of the negotiations. I very much hope that it will yield results and that we can find a solution. But it’s not for us to discuss. What I would say is that there are substantial risks to real growth in the United Kingdom, but also as a knock-on effect on the eurozone. So we are not complacent about it, but the financial sector is now pretty well prepared for a no-deal Brexit, if that were to happen, because there has been a lot of work.  But have companies actually prepared for a Plan B? If there is a no-deal Brexit, what would it mean actually for growth in Europe? You say: systemically, we’re okay…  Systemically we are okay. For the functioning of the financial sector, which is a lot in London, as we know, I think most of the players are well prepared now.  Do you worry about a big shock, though, to PMIs, to GDP if there is a no-deal Brexit?  That would be a big shock to the UK economy. How much will it ripple around? We don’t know yet, but there would be an impact, of course.  Given this environment, can the ECB hike rates this year?  As I said, we are monitoring the data. We have this rate guidance: we say we are not going to move before through the summer. We could change it, we could extend it. The market sends a signal that it expects the rate hike to be much later than what we have said. It is part of the functioning of our rate guidance; it shows that the rate guidance works well to anchor expectations. It’s too early to have the discussion because we are still (in the process of) understanding the nature of the shock.  Are you comfortable with how the market took the President’s comments yesterday?  Yes, we are. We’ve seen quite a lot of flattening of forward curves, even ahead of the Governing Council, and that, in itself, provides financial accommodation, so it’s part of the solution. We are comfortable with it. If the market were to overreact, if at some point we see market expectations which don’t fit the way we see the economy, then we would have to react. We would adjust our guidance; and we may have to do it at some point.  Would that be after March?  I don’t know. It’s a thought process and it’s very much data driven.  What tools does the ECB actually, or could the ECB, deploy to counteract this slowdown?  Looking back, any time we’ve had to adjust to a new environment, we’ve done so, either using existing instruments or finding new instruments within our mandate, legally. We’ve been able to do it. What we have today in our toolbox, as you know, is negative rates. It’s rate guidance, which we can adjust. And it’s liquidity provision which, as you know, was part of the discussion yesterday, even though, here again, it’s way too early to take a decision.  Benoît Cœuré, talk to me about TLTROs. We heard from President Draghi yesterday that the ECB will need to have a good monetary policy case to offer a new round of long-term loans. The market is reading this as actually this is now less likely. Was that the message?  No, the message is: there are different contingencies and we need to find the instruments, which one is best fitted to the contingency we’re seeing. TLTROs are about credit, right? It’s not about providing liquidity per se. There is a lot of liquidity in the system; excess liquidity is very ample in the eurozone. The TLTROs are addressing what we call “impairments in monetary policy transmission” – that is, they are supporting bank credit. We have to know if what we are seeing now is an impairment or is likely to lead to an impairment of bank credit. Then, that could be an instrument; it’s very much – possibly – on the table, but depending on the contingency we are facing. We need to think more deeply about it.  So do you have an idea what kind of conditions you would need to actually offer a new round?  Obviously that’s a lot about monitoring the way credit is extended by banks all around the eurozone, globally and locally, and how much bank funding will impact the rate of lending to the economy. So far, financial conditions remain very supportive of growth and that’s also why we didn’t move yesterday; because we feel that the setup we have, the instruments we’ve deployed, provide for a financial environment which is very supportive of the economy.  But do you worry that there’s a risk that, basically, the banks will start repaying some of these TLTROs this summer?  Yes, there is, and that’s why we are starting that reflection now. But as the President said yesterday, that has to be a monetary policy discussion. We are not going to have an LTRO or a TLTRO for the sake of banks meeting the net stable funding ratio. That’s not the business line we are in; that’s for banks to prepare for themselves.  But if they repay, that would tighten financial conditions?  Well, that’s part of many business decisions that banks are taking. Our job is to look at the outcome in terms of financial conditions and to see if it’s proper in terms of the monetary conditions that we want to see. So it’s one issue. But it’s only one argument among many others.  Are you talking to the banks to have an idea of what they’ll do so that you can prepare yourself also for the balance sheet?  Yes, we are, of course. And we are talking to our supervisory colleagues because that’s what they do: talk to banks.  Benoît Cœuré, how much does the personality of the President actually influence the decision of the Governing Council?  Well, that’s an interesting question. The Governing Council is a collegial body; the President has to be in a position to filter information out of the diversity of the Governing Council and to build consensus, which the Presidents so far have been able to do and have done very well. It is important to be in a position to build consensus.  How can you see the dynamics of the Council changing once President Draghi leaves?  I don’t see the dynamic of the Council changing very much. We have a diversity of individuals and that’s why we have a Governing Council. It’s right because we need to filter out the diversity of views in Europe. That’s what the Governing Council is there for.  Benoît Cœuré, you said that you will continue to work for Europe and you don’t exclude any possibility. If you were offered the top job – President of the ECB – would you accept?  Yes, who wouldn’t? But it’s really not for me to decide, it’s not for me to reflect on. I want to continue to be useful. There are many opportunities. I have a job at the ECB until the end of the year, so it’s really not for me to have that discussion.  Benoît Cœuré, thank you so much for joining us right here at of course Davos, World Economic Forum 2019.    "
2019-01-17,Sabine Lautenschläger,Interview with Politico,"Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Politico on 14 January 2019 and published on 17 January 2019","  Interview with Politico   Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Politico on 14 January 2019 and published on 17 January 2019  Are we heading for a clash between regulators and banks?  No, I don’t believe so. Firstly, the kind of increases in capital requirements you will see are an improvement of the rules in regards to risk sensitivity, which are very bank specific, depending on their business model. It is not an average increase of capital for all banks, as such. Second, the Basel implementation is spread over nine years until 2027 — nine years!  Are banks overplaying this?  I think that most of them are overplaying it. You always need to look at whether risk sensitivities are considered adequately. But that is up to the supervisor. The rules in Basel are general abstract rules.  Former ECB executive board member Vítor Constâncio warned against the risks of shadow banking, and Luis de Guindos has continued along that line …  I fully agree with him. As banks are regulated more strongly, some business has become much costlier for them to take on. A lot of business moved over into the shadow banking sector, which is interlinked to the banking sector. This is why this sector is so important to look at, not as a banking supervisor, but from a financial stability point of view. For me, the first step would be to ensure that you have much more knowledge about a sector that is growing and increasing in importance. They influence liquidity in some asset classes in the market and might thus have strong implications for financial stability.  How do we do that? Stronger disclosure rules?  I would first like to know what is the exposure, what is the risk, what are the interconnections in the sector. Then I’d ask myself, do we need more rules? So, more reporting, yes. A different way of reporting.  Because the current setup is insufficient?  Yes, it is insufficient. Somebody has to look into it. If these are global players, perhaps the global standard setters should look at it. And not only in a static way. The mistake you should never do is only to look at what you have in your balance sheet. You also need to look at the flows in and out.  On to monetary policy. Inflation has been dipping since October.  Which we projected. So, nothing surprising.  You wouldn’t say we’ve been overly dependent on quantitative easing?  This is a little too much of a link to QE. We expected a dip in the inflation ratio. It was clear that with the base effects of the energy prices, the inflation rate would drop. That’s why we’ve always said that we need to see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation; not a change in the month that we just had but a sustained adjustment. The core inflation rate didn’t dip that much.  You said in November that you expect rates to rise this year. Do you still think that?  I’ll wait for the projections coming in March before I change my view. I’m data-driven in this, and I think that as we are still in the environment we projected. I do not feel disheartened yet and then you have to think where you will start with a rise in interest rates. We have different key rates, not only one.  I wanted to ask you about the ECB jobs: Has the appointment process become too political?  There are appointment rules, they have to be complied with. It’s not in the ECB’s power to appoint. Other people appoint. We have to accept the rules.  But do you not have a view on it?  For me, it’s important to have people proposed that can do their job because of their experience and their knowledge. That for me is the most important thing.  Soon, we’ll have a new European Parliament, a new Commission, and a new ECB president. What’s the next focus for supervisors and regulators?  Looking forward to the next five years, for sure we have to work further on getting the banks to clean up their legacy, to strengthen their resilience, not only in regard to capital and liquidity but also in regard to risk management. This is a very important issue. What we will do in the next two years, among other things, is to look at credit underwriting standards. This is very important when the sun has been shining for so long, with so much liquidity in a low interest rate environment. This is usually the environment where banks drop their credit underwriting standards, which then lays the ground for the next crisis. So, we will look into credit underwriting standards, in particular in real estate and leveraged finance.  When will we see development in credit underwriting?  This year. It’s in our supervisory priorities. We will have dedicated onsite inspections to assess the quality of specific asset class exposures. We are already starting on drafting a methodology.   "
2019-01-16,Yves Mersch,Interview with Hospodarske noviny,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Kristina Votrubova on 11 January 2019","  Interview with Hospodarske noviny   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Kristina Votrubova on 11 January 2019  There are rumours about the ECB´s plans to raise interest rates, however there are also voices that it is not a good idea, as the situation is changing. What is the ECB´s position?  The ECB’s position is that we will continue with our policy of monetary accommodation for as long as necessary. We are confident that what we have done is helping us to get inflation in line with our objective at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  So no date has been established for raising the interest rates.  We never announce in advance how, when or by how much we intend to use different instruments. That is not how central banks work. We give broad forward guidance on the direction of our monetary policy. But we always look at incoming information and evaluate whether it is in line with how we expected the economy to behave. What is currently happening to the economy is still broadly in line with our baseline scenario. We had already anticipated a slowdown in growth when we announced these baselines. Now that the slowdown is materialising, we do not have to take it into account for a second time in our policy response. Fundamentals have not changed but political uncertainty has increased.   Slovakia would need interest rates to rise as household debt is increasing alarmingly. What is the ECB’s view of the situation in Slovakia?  First, we conduct monetary policy for the euro area as a whole rather than for individual countries. Second, if we raised interest rates to curb household debt, the effect would also impact the corporate sector and investment. That is why there are macroprudential instruments at the disposal of national authorities. And I have seen that the competent authorities in Slovakia, including the national central bank, have taken action to tackle the dynamic rise of household debt. I think once you have put such instruments into action, you would like to see also what the effect of these instruments is. Do they work as is expected? And, as I have been told, there seems to be a positive reaction.  In the majority of European countries, the economic cycle has already reached its peak and the euro area economy is slowing down. How does the ECB view the situation and what are you going to do about it?  As I said, we take the expected path of the economy into account in our policy decisions. However, a slowdown does not mean that we will slide into a recession. What is happening right now is what we expected to happen.  So are you reconsidering plans to end quantitative easing?  At each meeting of the Governing Council we assess whether the economy is in line with our expected baseline scenario. If we identify a deviation, we analyse the reasons for it and the impact it is likely to have on inflation. Let me remind you that our sole objective is to maintain price stability.   The German economy, which is the largest economy in the euro area, has underperformed expectations. What does this mean for the euro area as a whole?   The slowdown in the third quarter was mainly caused by the automotive industry, which was affected by the diesel scandal and related aspects. But a slowdown in one quarter in one country is not sufficient to prompt a monetary policy response at the euro area level. We would have to see whether a slightly deeper slowdown in one quarter might not be followed by a slightly better performance in the following quarter. Once the relevant data are available, we will assess the trend and the future path of the euro area economy. We will then judge whether it is still in line with our inflation expectations, as price stability is the only needle in our compass.  How will Brexit affect the euro area economy?  The UK economy has been deeply integrated into the European one in very diverse sectors. Inevitably, Brexit will have some consequences. However, it is unclear which players will be relative winners or losers, as the consequences will not be evenly distributed. Obviously, we would have preferred not to have Brexit, because we are not eager to see unnecessary shocks to the economy. For me, the main concern is uncertainty, which has a negative impact on all sectors of the economy and on all countries.   "
2019-01-09,Luis de Guindos,Interview with Latvian TV,"Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Toms Pastors on 7 January and broadcast on 9 January for Latvian TV1 “Pasaules Panorama (World Panorama”)","  Interview with Latvian TV   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Toms Pastors on 7 January and broadcast on 9 January for Latvian TV1 “Pasaules Panorama (World Panorama”)  The euro as a currency has just entered the age of young adult, if you will. There have been some growing pains especially during the sovereign debt crisis. How would you rate the role we have taken thus far? Did we barely survive these 20 years, or are we in a good position at the moment?  Well, it's obvious that we've had difficulties but if you look backwards, I think that you can realise that the euro has been a very important success. Undoubtedly the euro is the most important element of European integration. It's not only economics or financial issues; it's that this is the real instrument in terms of cooperation. Despite the difficulties, because undoubtedly we had the debt crisis, as you have said, today the euro has delivered financial and economic stability to the euro zone. It is the second most important world currency now in terms of reserves. And we have an inflation rate that's below 2 %, -but close to 2%. Even if you look at the measures we have taken in the last five years, monetary policy has been one of the main drivers of the recovery that we have now in Europe. So, all in all, despite the difficulties and although we still need reforms to be taken in the near future, I think that we can conclude that the euro, the single currency has been a real success.  There was a time when we were actively speaking about the possibility that we might lose one member state and this last year Greece finished the whole programme. Do you feel that at the moment the mechanisms are there to avoid a situation like this; that crisis in one country could lead to a really large problem for the whole euro zone?  I think there is something about the euro that is quite relevant. The euro is a project that you can join in but that is much more difficult to leave. In that regard, I would say that we come from the difficulties over the last ten years making reforms. We created the ESM, we set up the banking union, so we have been acquiring additional instruments to overcome the difficulties. I think that we are much more prepared to face a new crisis despite the fact that there are gaps; gaps that we have to fill.   One of the gaps, if you look at the euro zone as a whole and the member states of the EU, you can see that even countries that are really financially stable are still refusing to do what they signed up to do – to introduce the euro, like in Sweden or Poland. Twenty years is a long time. Why haven't any steps been taken towards introducing the euro in these countries?  Well, I think that you know some countries have joined the euro. Latvia is a very good example. Now you are celebrating your fifth anniversary of joining the euro. The euro is the currency of the European Union, so in that regard I think that is a question of time. I am totally sure that besides the United Kingdom, that unfortunately is leaving the Union, and besides Denmark the rest of the countries will eventually join the euro. I think that in order to do that, we have to complete the financial and institutional architecture of the euro zone.   Do you have any timetables in mind?  No, it's very difficult to put forward a timetable in that area, but I'm fully convinced that as the euro makes progress and time goes by more and more countries will join the euro zone – we have the case of Bulgaria now. And I suppose other countries will rapidly start to apply to join the euro. If you look at the polls – the polls are very clear – 75% of the population of the euro zone is in favour of the single currency. So we cannot be complacent but I think, and this is quite relevant in the times that we are living now, the euro is the main instrument that we have in terms of political integration, in terms of financial integration and there is a lot of political will behind the single currency, so what I would expect is that more and more countries will eventually join the euro zone.  As you mentioned, this is the time when the UK is leaving the European Union and many are unhappy, including many Brits themselves. But there is also this talk that without the UK, Europe could further develop towards closer integration, towards fiscal union, banking union and so on. Do you feel that this is also a possibility for the rest of the EU to go towards deeper integration?  Well, the first thing that I have to say is that Brexit is something that is detrimental especially to the UK, but also for the rest of the Union. These are the decisions made by the British population, we have nothing to say in that regard. But I think that it’s going to be quite negative in terms of economic performance for the UK. The rest of the members of the Union will have to continue cooperating and continue integrating our economies. I think that in that aspect further integration is the correct answer. I repeat again, it’s quite unfortunate that the UK, such a big economy, leaves the Union, but this decision is taken by the British people. We regret that decision. I would like to express that we have to continue cooperating with the UK and that I hope that we will have a divorce that will be orderly and that will let us continue operating with the UK. But now the decision has to be taken by the British parliament, so full respect for the decisions taken by the British population and by the British parliament. But I think that we will have to continue our integration process in the euro area.   Given the current political climate in Europe, do you feel that moving towards closer integration is the right step because we see a lot of backlash at this moment both in nationalistic, populist and so on?  Undoubtedly we have seen more populism all over Europe in recent years, but I think that the correct response is to take further steps in terms of integration. There is not an easy fix to the problems of Europe. But I think that the euro indicates that there is a way forward and that we can overcome difficulties together and that the very nationalistic and domestic approaches are not enough in order to do that, but that it’s much better to do it together. And in that regard the euro is the main element of coherence and the main element of political integration and financial integration that we have in the EU.  If we take one case in particular – that of Italy – we see that there is this new government that is really pointing the finger against these technocratic institutions, including the ECB, and saying this is not the future, we cannot go on like this. They're the third largest euro zone member, so third most important. So what can you answer to that kind of political sentiment that indeed is rising?  I do not want to comment on any particular country, but even if you look at Italy, if you look at the polls, there is a very important majority of the Italian people who support the euro. We have seen that the Italian government – and I think that is something that is quite positive – has switched to an agreement with the European Commission on the draft budgetary plan of Italy. We have seen that since this agreement has been reached, the financial tensions in Italy have started to ease. I think that this is an indication that there is a way forward. My impression is that we have to explain very clearly to the European people that there is not an easy fix, that there are no magic solutions for complicated problems, but that the only way forward is to continue with the process of further integration at the European level, and that this is going to be the best solution and the best alternative in terms of the well-being, the lives of the European people.  How do you see this integration in the next five or ten years? Do you have some idea? For example, you mentioned a new member state - if the convergence criteria are fulfilled - regarding Bulgaria. Other things? What are you looking for?  I think that we cannot be complacent. If you look backwards with respect to the evolution of the European economy you realise that monetary policy has been the main driver of the recovery. We are entering into the fourth consecutive year of recovery in Europe. More than nine million jobs have been created within Europe. I think that monetary policy has been the main driver of this recovery. But there are other steps that we have to complete. For instance we started the project of the banking union; that is something that is quite relevant, we have a level playing field for all the banks in the euro zone. We created the SSM, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, also the Single Resolution Board. But there is a third part that has not been completed, there is a third pillar, the common deposit guarantee scheme. I normally say that a banking union is like a table. A table needs three legs in order to be stable. We have two – supervision and resolution – but we need a third one that is quite relevant, a common deposit insurance scheme, what we call EDIS in our jargon. So this is something where we have to take steps in order to make further progress.  And there is another very important project, the capital markets union. In order to do that we need to harmonise the different regulations among different countries, something that is not easy, something that has been put forward by Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis. But I think that is going to be key. Finally, well, we will have the discussion about a fiscal instrument in order to confront potential asymmetric shocks in the euro zone. From a political standpoint the last European Council decided that we should start with this fiscal facility. I think that is a first step. Normally long trips start with the first step. We have taken the first step in order to have this fiscal facility. I'm thinking that is something that should complement monetary policy in order to have all these instruments to confront shocks, to confront a crisis, because a crisis will arrive for sure.   Given the different approaches that the member states are having, do you feel that a two speed, a multi-speed Europe is a risk, a possibility, an inevitability?  I do not see it now. I think that we should work in parallel. I hope that we should create the political will in every country in order to work together and to advance and make progress together. I believe that a single speed is much better than a multi-speed euro zone or European Union.   "
2019-01-07,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with France Inter,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Ali Baddou and Alexandra Bensaid and broadcast on 4 January 2019","  Interview with France Inter   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Ali Baddou and Alexandra Bensaid and broadcast on 4 January 2019  Thank you for taking the time to talk to us here at France Inter before returning to your office at the ECB in Frankfurt. The ECB, the European Central Bank, plays a prominent role in the lives of Europeans, in our day-to-day lives, and yet we don’t always know what you are doing in your ultra-modern tower in Frankfurt. If you had to explain the ECB in just a few words, say, to a high school student – we currently have a number of high school interns here at France Inter who are listening this morning – what would you say, Mr Cœuré?   The ECB is actually two towers in Frankfurt, because we do two different things: we look after the euro, we ensure the stability of the euro, the purchasing power of the euro...  Which has just celebrated its 20th anniversary...  Which has just celebrated its 20th anniversary, yes. The ECB was established in July 1998 and the euro on 1 January 1999. So, on the one hand we decide on monetary policy for the 19 countries of the euro area to ensure the stability and purchasing power of the euro, and on the other we supervise European banks. These are two different jobs, in two different locations in Frankfurt.   Did everything change at the ECB after the 2008 crisis?  Yes. It is fair to say everything changed. The crisis accelerated the ECB’s shift towards a model more similar to those of other central banks around the world, such as the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England. It was a dramatic event – traumatising – but it was a kind of coming of age for our institution.  Do you also – and this is also a question for our high school students – monitor the techniques used by counterfeiters, for example those who print fake euros?  Yes, and this is really important because money seems to be a very abstract topic – take the macroeconomy and percentages, for example – but it’s also a very real issue: we do a lot of “plumbing” at the ECB! We manage banknotes, coordinating their printing and preparation, as well as their design with security features. As you know, a new series of banknotes is currently being introduced. The €50 banknote was issued recently and will be followed by the €100 and €200 banknotes soon.  And you’re withdrawing the €500 banknote from circulation?   Exactly. We’re no longer printing the €500 banknote because it has become too popular for money laundering purposes and other unsavoury uses. So we’re stopping it. A great deal of our time is also occupied by payments, all the techniques used to transfer money from one account to another. Just a month ago, we launched a real-time payment system which allows all euro area banks, if they want, to make person-to-person transfers within a matter of seconds.  There’s a second thing I wanted to ask you. What is QE, or quantitative easing? It’s incomprehensible to the general public, but it’s a staggering programme: over the past few years, ECB traders – your traders – have purchased €2.5 trillion in public and private debt. The programme has been halted. What purpose did it serve?  Yes, that’s right. Over four years, between 2015 and 2018 – our last net purchases were made a few days ago, just before Christmas – we bought European public and private debt amounting to €2.6 trillion. Why? It’s very simple: to reduce the cost of financing in the euro area. The central banks – they teach this in high school – steer the overnight interest rate. But, this is not sufficient as firms borrow over a period of three, five, ten years. So the three-year, five-year and ten-year interest rates also need to be lowered. To do this, we buy government bonds, and this has considerably improved financing conditions, which, in turn, boosts consumption and investment in the euro area.  €2.5 trillion, Mr Cœuré – you say this has given a boost to consumption and investment. But ultimately if we look at growth, all this money quite frankly doesn’t seem – at least to people in France – to have gone to them, into their pockets, into a rebounding economy...  Of course it’s gone to them! Through all the mechanisms that make the economy work: lowering interest rates for lending to companies, which we did not only in France and Germany, but also in Greece, Italy and everywhere in the euro area, has boosted investment. By boosting investment and consumption we create jobs. Just to give you a figure, since 2013 almost ten million jobs have been created in the euro area. In terms of the level of employment, we have now returned to a level higher than that before the 2008 crisis, and that’s partly, largely – in no small part – due to monetary policy.  And in this regard, Mr Cœuré, we’re going to experience, we’ve just experienced, a big turning point. You’ve said you’re going to stop this quantitative easing policy, this policy of injecting liquidity to boost the economy. Does this mean that interest rates will rise for French people? And when?  No, we’re not stopping it, but we’ve stopped increasing it. You mentioned this figure of €2.5 trillion. It’s going to stay at this level, but it will not decrease, so it cannot be said that monetary policy is more restrictive. In addition, the short-term interest rates that the ECB controls directly are going to stay at their current level, i.e. at zero and even below zero, at least through the summer of 2019, and for as long as required for inflation to return towards 2%, which is our aim. So interest rates will remain low for a long time yet.  You’re currently making a major turnaround – the same thing is also happening in the United States – while growth is already slowing down.   It isn’t a major turnaround, it’s an adjustment which is justified by the fact that this programme was launched in 2015 when the euro area was on the edge of a precipice, faced with the risk of deflation. We’re no longer in this situation at all. It’s true that growth is slowing down, but it is still around 1.5% in the euro area, whereas at the time it had been zero. So this allows for an adjustment, but interest rates will remain very, very low for a long time yet.   The euro has celebrated its 20th anniversary. Did you celebrate at the European Central Bank?  No. One doesn’t really celebrate a currency. Besides, we have work to do. We have had a dinner and we will have a conference in Sintra in Portugal in June to discuss what has worked and what hasn’t worked with a broad range of participants.   What hasn’t worked?  Since it’s time to reflect on the past 20 years, I would say the euro as a currency has been a huge success: it’s stable, inflation has been considerably lower in the last 20 years than in the decades before that, and this has supported purchasing power, it has supported the purchasing power of Europeans.  Really?  Yes, really.  That’s really the opposite of what every single person thinks, namely that since the euro prices have shot up. Why do you say this, Mr Cœuré?  There are purchasing power issues, problems with wages, problems with wage distribution. That’s why people are taking to the streets and that’s true for many countries in Europe and beyond...   Everyone thinks that life has become more expensive since the euro!  ...but this isn’t linked to price inflation. Price inflation since 1999 has been 1.6% on average. If you look at the 20 years before that, before the euro was created, inflation was 4%.   But why do people have this perception of reality? Is everyone crazy?  No, I think it’s due to people comparing prices in euro with prices in francs – for those who can still remember prices in francs. As time goes on they will become fewer and fewer. There are a lot of young people who don’t remember prices in francs...  Apparently, 54% of French people still mentally convert euros into francs...  They’re remembering prices from 1999, prices from 20 years ago. You can’t compare today’s prices with prices from 20 years ago. In other words, even if we’d kept the franc, there would have been inflation, and that’s what people are not seeing.   You say that purchasing power ultimately isn’t an inflation problem which would eat away at French people’s budgets. You spoke about wages. Do wages need to rise?  Throughout Europe we’re seeing dissatisfaction, frustration and feelings of injustice when it comes to matters of income and distribution of income. But ultimately, what distributes wages is growth and productivity, and so the priority for all countries in Europe, including France, is to have an economy that creates productivity gains and allows wealth to be distributed, and this is what enables wages to be distributed. Wage growth without productivity gains isn’t good for the economy.   The European Central Bank is an unelected institution that appears to be extremely far removed from citizens. You’re criticised for being essentially responsible for a form of “democratic hold-up”, an expression used by journalist Jean Quatremer: you’re taking away budgetary sovereignty; the euro area is described as being under German sovereignty; you’ve invested absolutely huge sums in saving banks and the financial system, but it’s European people who have paid the price, with taxes, strict policies, the list is endless. What would you say in defence of your institution, Mr Cœuré?  I’ve read Jean Quatremer’s book, “Il faut achever l’euro”. Now, when he speaks of the “democratic hold-up” he’s not talking about the ECB, but about European institutions and the way the euro functions in general. And it’s true, I agree with him: there’s a democratic deficit in the way the euro area functions. Look at the discussion with Greece. Extremely painful measures have been discussed for the Greek economy, for the Greek people, and this discussion was between the Greek minister and the other 18 finance ministers – it never went to the European Parliament. So there is a problem. But it’s not the ECB.  Ok, but the ECB formulates monetary policy that does not depend on governments or citizens, but considerably influences the economic policies and day-to-day lives of European citizens...  That’s true, but what allows the ECB to be independent is its very narrow, very clear, very simple and very precise mandate, which is to bring the inflation rate back towards 2%. This is how we are judged. And we are accountable to the European Parliament. We go everywhere – I visit high schools, go to conferences, I discuss with people. We are on Twitter, we’re in dialogue with European citizens...  And with France Inter!  And with France Inter, which is important as it allows me to explain all of these things. Yes, we are bureaucrats in Frankfurt, but this independence is possible...  And technocrats!  ...and technocrats... This independence is possible because we have a very narrow mandate which can be monitored. The rest of the system is political, and requires democratic accountability.  You’re a left-winger, Mr Cœuré, but despite that you won’t get rid of the idea that some people have of you that you’re investing huge sums in saving banks, money which could have been used for social policies, for example, or for investments directly benefiting citizens’ day-to-day lives.  No, that’s not true. First, my political opinions have nothing to do with my job as a central banker, which is not a political role. And second, the €2.6 trillion we’ve invested...  That’s political!  Why did we do it? We did it because we were on the brink of deflation. We brought inflation back towards 2%, we created ten million jobs, and if it’s good for employment, it’s also good for European citizens.  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has two mandates: inflation and full employment.  Yes.  And if you were to add full employment?  In one respect, it’s not up to me to discuss this. I cannot decide on my own mandate – that’s up to the Parliament. It’s a political discussion. But honestly, over the last five, ten years, this wouldn’t have changed anything. Everything we do – creating liquidity, buying securities, cutting interest rates to zero – is to support both output and inflation. So we would have done the same thing. Today, this debate is largely theoretical.  Mr Cœuré, reflecting on the “yellow vests” movement in France – I’d also like your opinion on that – citizens, in Italy too, have been calling for budgetary constraints to be loosened. Budgetary constraints are governed by the Maastricht Treaty – 3% budget deficit and maximum 60% public debt. Do these rules need to be reviewed?  I don’t think my answer is going to make me very popular on your show.  Go on!  I think these are good rules. France has almost never complied with them. I find it a little strange to complain about rules you’ve never adhered to! France has not balanced its budget since the 1970s, as you know...  Yes, but when budgets are tightened, one says: “those are the Maastricht rules”. They haven’t been complied with but clearly, at the moment, cuts are being made at every level...  I completely understand that people feel hard done by when it comes to redistribution, and that’s also an economic efficiency issue. There is a redistribution problem. But I don’t agree that the solution is more deficit and more debt. Redistribution is a political discussion.  So you don’t agree, but we are all thinking about the arm wrestling over the Italian budget, between a government that has just been elected and taken power, and the European Commission. The Commission actually embodied the denial of universal suffrage. Do you appreciate the difference there?  Yes, I do. But the mechanism has worked; in fact, it’s worked well. The European Commission expressed its point of view, based on European rules. Then there was a discussion, a negotiation between Pierre Moscovici and the Italian finance minister, and an agreement was reached on a revised budget that was debated and voted on by the Italian Parliament. It cannot be said that the Commission was holding a knife to their throat or pointing a gun at their head.  Really?  If anyone was holding a gun to their head, it was the financial markets, not the Commission. Italian interest rates were rising, which meant the debt burden was increasing, which was bad for the Italian people. That wasn’t Europe’s doing; it was simply a reflection that, ultimately, you have to be able to finance yourself.  Nevertheless, it was in the name of these Maastricht rules that in 2011-2012 austerity was imposed on Europe and the growth that had begun to take hold dropped off again...  Yes, that may have been excessive. It’s all about finding the right balance. I don’t disagree with you on this. But I don’t think it’s good for a country like France to permanently run a deficit of over 3%, simply because you have to be prepared for the next economic downturn. Today we are seeing growth – not enough – but there is some growth. If we don’t reduce the deficit now, we won’t be ready when there are real economic difficulties, and it will be even more painful the next time.  Before taking questions from listeners, Mr Cœuré, a question to you as a banker: the stock markets, in particular the US stock market, have been falling for two weeks. Should we be worrying about a major financial crisis in the coming months?  There are many uncertainties around the global economy that are not primarily financial in nature, but first and foremost linked to trade and to the tensions surrounding trade, especially between the United States and China. The financial markets, understandably, are very concerned about this, because it’s the whole engine of global trade that’s challenged.  Understandably, you said? Aren’t the financial markets also involved in purely speculative activity that is detached from the real economy?  They can see that these discussions over trade are acting as a brake on the global economy. There are speculative mechanisms and amplifier effects coming on top. But the root of the concerns is linked to the fact that the international relations that have supported global growth for the past 20 years are crumbling, are being eroded, and that’s a concern for everybody. Questions from the audience:   The European Central Bank has poured trillions of euro into the European economy, which still hasn’t reached an inflation rate of 2%. These trillions must have been hidden away somewhere, otherwise inflation would have been much higher. So who hid away these trillions of euro? Probably the financial markets?   No. First of all, we’re not giving money to banks. This is money that is lent and that returns to our balance sheet. The liquidity that is created is deposited by banks overnight at the ECB. So the answer to the question “who is hiding this money away?” is that it returns to the ECB. We have it. Moreover, these deposits bear a negative interest rate, so we actually earn money on them which we redistribute to the European taxpayers, because our profits are distributable and returned to taxpayers. And by the way, this has allowed banks’ liquidity constraints to be loosened, which has enabled them to lend more to businesses and households.  The ECB was able to free up billions of euro to help banks in 2008 and 2010. Why couldn’t it free up the same amount for the ecological transition and thereby help individual citizens, for example to ensure that buildings are insulated?  We are doing that, to a certain extent...  And there are many questions in the same vein.  Of course, and it’s a very important topic for us. A network of central banks is working on climate-related issues, also from the financial regulation perspective. For example, how can banks and financial institutions be mandated to take into account the risks linked to climate change? This is also an important question.  We’ve seen that six large French banks have been investing massively in polluting energy sources. You at the ECB have supported polluting energy sources by purchasing the bonds of Total and Shell, for example...  With regard to the banks, this is becoming a priority area for banking supervision – monitoring the risks the banks are taking by financing polluting activities. As regards the ECB itself, we have public and corporate debt purchase programmes. Among other things, these programmes have enabled us to purchase “green bonds” issued by the French government, by the European Investment Bank, etc. We are purchasing some of these bonds, in fact we are purchasing a substantial amount of them: around a quarter of the green bonds issued in Europe have been purchased by the ECB. They are on our balance sheet and we are thus directly providing climate finance.  So you’re purchasing both? Total bonds and green bonds at the same time?  Yes. We’re purchasing Total bonds because, when we purchase corporate bonds, we do so precisely according to what is available in the market. We don’t want to distort the market structure. The ECB could be asked to add a climate objective to its price stability objective, but that would be getting into a political discussion. Why climate over equality, over employment? This is a political question. We can’t decide it for ourselves.  First I would just like to comment on what Mr Cœuré said about salary increases being linked to growth and productivity gains. For years, productivity gains were huge and it was shareholders who benefited more than workers and employees. But my question is the following: why does the ECB not finance governments directly, as was done in the 1970s before Mr Giscard d’Estaing intervened and forced the French government to finance itself on the financial markets? It’s much less restrictive in the United States, for example, where they can finance themselves through the US central bank. This gives much more room for manoeuvre as the government is being financed by its central bank rather than the markets, as Mr Cœuré just mentioned.   We understood your question but first we need you to explain something: when a government, for example the French government, needs money, where does it borrow that money from?  When a government needs money it borrows it on the “financial markets”, which in reality means it borrows from institutional investors, many of which are, in fact, French. More specifically, we’re talking about the savings of French citizens, funds and insurers. Life insurance is invested in government bonds.  The French government can’t borrow directly from the European Central Bank?  No, it can’t borrow directly from the European Central Bank. Since 2015, as we discussed, we have been making purchases on the secondary market, after public debt securities have been issued by the governments. But we are only doing this to a limited extent, and we have imposed an upper limit on these purchases.  €2.5 trillion – that’s quite the upper limit!  Unfortunately there’s a lot more debt in Europe. We have imposed an upper limit on our purchases: we would not purchase more than one-third of a single government’s debt.  Could the ECB lend directly to governments?  No, this is forbidden by the EU Treaties. Even before 1974, we didn’t do it! The famous Giscard decrees ratified an already-existing situation. It’s been a long time since France borrowed money or financed itself by printing money, before 1974, even. And the idea that the United States could finance itself directly by printing money is also a myth. It isn’t true. The US government borrows on the financial markets. The Fed, the US central bank, does not lend to the US government. It doesn’t lend a single cent to the US government.  France’s public debt has reached 100% [of its GDP], but on the markets we’re still borrowing at very low rates. We’ve reached a symbolic milestone. Mr Cœuré, is it really that serious?  Yes, it’s serious, because the direction of travel is serious. France is a country that is really struggling to get its deficit below 3%. Its debt is at 100%. If the deficit stays above 3%, the debt will then mechanically be above 100%, and at some point one will find it increasingly difficult to borrow on the markets. Today, it is not too serious because, thanks to the ECB’s monetary policy, rates are very low. But one has to prepare oneself for situations when the rates will be higher, especially if there is no more growth. The debt burden will begin to crowd out all the government’s other budgetary expenditure. It’s not normal for the debt burden to crowd out spending on healthcare, justice or education.   It’s not normal...  It’s what the future has in store for us, if we don’t reduce the deficit.  Who decides this?  We’re talking about budgetary policy, so it’s the French government, not the ECB.  In his New Year’s address, the French President declared that “ultraliberal capitalism is nearing its end”. This is something of a prophecy, and a little difficult to understand. What does it mean to you?  I don’t want to try to interpret the words of the French President. How I would put it is that there is a certain vision of unbridled globalisation with no restrictions, particularly on financial transactions and the international capital markets, and with no real control of finance. This vision has been shown to have failed. This has been clear since 2007/08, and we are still dealing with the consequences.  But we’re still there!  We’re still there.  There’s shadow banking, there are the effects of speculation that are more significant now than ever.  Yes.  Is the crisis machine still there?  The crisis machine is still there. There will be other financial crises. We haven’t done everything that could be done in terms of financial regulation, especially in the area of shadow banking, but also in terms of banking regulation. We might even be turning the dial back. As the financial crisis recedes further into the past, bad habits are creeping back in. The lobbies are reasserting themselves. There is a whole movement to deregulate finance once again. We really have to resist it.  Could 2019 be a new crisis year? Is it a big concern that China’s economy is slowing?  We hope not and we don’t foresee it, because global growth remains strong. Even in the euro area as a whole, and in France specifically, growth is still comfortable. We are no longer in recession, there is no need to overreact. But it’s true that there is a slowdown caused by worries surrounding trade and, as you say, there is still the risk of a financial crisis. We have to be very vigilant.  Mr Cœuré, could you possibly say something to make us fall in love with Europe again?  We’re living through a period when globalisation is being reshaped. Europe is our most powerful weapon because we will do better together. We will be better placed to negotiate with the United States, China and Russia if we do so together rather than in isolation. We must take full advantage of all the tools we have available at the European level. We aren’t doing enough; we have to do better.  Thank you, Benoît Cœuré, for talking to us here at France Inter, for answering our questions candidly and for taking on the role of educator and explaining your work. We wish you a safe trip back to Frankfurt and a happy New Year.  Thank you, and a very happy New Year.   "
2018-12-30,Sabine Lautenschläger,Interview with Deutschlandfunk,"Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Klemens Kindermann and broadcast on 30 December 2018 ","  Interview with Deutschlandfunk   Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Klemens Kindermann and broadcast on 30 December 2018   Ms Lautenschläger, the euro is now 20 years old. On 1 January 1999 it became legal tender for 11 out of 15 EU Member States, initially in electronic form and then as cash as of 2002. Germany has participated from the outset, alongside countries such as France and Italy. Has the euro been a success?  Yes, the euro has definitely been a success, and indeed a success on an economic level. Many people merely associate the euro with being able to travel more easily to other countries without having to exchange German marks for French francs or Spanish pesetas, but it has most especially had economic benefits for our business enterprises and our firms. We are now truly an export-driven country. Trade within the euro area has increased and, thanks to the single currency, firms find it much easier to estimate the value of the payments owed to them. They do not run any exchange rate risk. But the euro has also been a success in political terms. We should not forget that the EU, and therefore the euro, has also been immensely important in preserving the peace that we have enjoyed in the euro area, in the EU, for the past 70 years. And since we are stronger together, and as part of the EU and the euro area are able to play a greater role in the global arena, also on the political front, we can do more to ensure peace for the political environment. So, in my view, the euro is a huge success.   According to a survey, even now around a third of German people still mentally convert German euro prices to German mark, at least for larger purchases. Can you understand that some Germans are still pining for the D-mark?  I’m not so sure that this mental conversion really is a sign that people are missing the D-mark. Especially for the older ones among us, it is simply a better way of estimating the value. Some people also do it out of habit. So I don’t think that Germans really want to have the D-mark back. I’ve heard that more than 80% of the German population have a very positive view of the euro…  On that note, the latest survey conducted by the EU Commission indicates that the German people’s acceptance of the euro is on the decline. Has a slide set in? In 2018, some 70% thought that the euro was good for Germany, compared with 76% in 2017. Those levels of acceptance are still high, but they have begun to slip back.   Yes, there are fluctuations here and there and of course there are years when some Germans feel more at ease, and more nationalistic, in their own country and some may then prefer to have their own currency. But, as you say, the levels are still at 70%, 76%, so I see no grounds for concern. l think that firms and younger people greatly appreciate having a currency that not only facilitates travel but also cross-border trade and payments.   Your reference to national sentiment actually brings us to the topic of the euro and populism. It is easy to forget, but the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party actually started out as an anti-single currency party. The refugee issue followed. Are you afraid that, in Germany too, an anti-euro stance might be rediscovered by the AfD?   I’d rather not make any statement on the political aspects. That is not a task for the ECB, although we do of course observe and take on board the fact that people in many countries have concerns and harbour a certain fear of globalisation.  I don’t think it’s about the euro, but rather that some people fear that they will be left behind in a global context and that they will no longer be able to control the situation. And then they believe, wrongly so in my view, that they will find more security by retreating to their national domain, their own sector and their own region.   But anti-euro sentiment has been explicitly stirred up in France and Italy during the respective electoral campaigns of Marine Le Pen, the Five Star Movement and the right-wing Northern League. Do populist movements pose a threat to the euro?  I would not say that it’s under threat but I think we must take the matter seriously and we must give a much better explanation – as this interview today enables me to do – of the benefits of the euro, the degree of prosperity and security that it brings and the number of jobs that depend on it. We need to explain that the euro simplifies trade between euro area countries and brings economic prosperity and jobs. All this is extremely important to me and it shows that we need to state this more often and much more clearly. In essence, however, I really believe that nationalistic tendencies – and I don’t just mean in Germany, but in the whole world, as we don’t need to confine ourselves to speaking about the EU – result from the fear of globalisation, that people can no longer control their own independent inner domains in the way they could before.   Let’s stay with Italy which had promised to limit its budget deficit next year to 0.8%. The target is currently set at 2.04% of GDP and the European Commission has now accepted that figure. Can the stability of the euro be preserved in this way?   I believe it is extremely important for all of us to adhere to the commonly agreed European fiscal rules.   Italy too?  Every country, including Germany, for example. It’s important because for a functioning economy, for sustainability in the euro area, all countries need to keep to certain budget limits and have sound public finances. That’s very important for the euro, but it goes beyond that because it also concerns the sustainability of government debt, etc. That’s important for every country, for Italy, for France, but also for Germany. And you may wish to remember that we were one of the first countries to infringe these rules.   Speaking of France, the French President Emmanuel Macron has made commitments in the order of billions of euro to the “yellow vest” protesters. France will next year have violated the new debt rule for the eleventh year in a row, apart from in 2017. Shouldn’t an excessive deficit procedure be launched against France?  To the best of my knowledge, the budget plans have not yet been fully decided on in France. It would be important to know whether if they spend more on one side, they may save more on the other side. I’m not aware that France has already discussed compensatory measures and presented them in a European context. So I don’t think the French government has got to that stage yet and we will have to wait and see,   The EU Commission wants to strengthen the euro’s role as a global currency. Is that possible and if so, how?  Yes, it is possible but is not the ECB’s role to do so. Our mandate is to maintain price stability. But we have just spoken about the euro’s importance for the economy, also for the German economy. And the European economy, i.e. firms in the euro area, who would benefit from as many payments as possible being made in euro rather than in US dollar or in other currencies. That would remove the exchange rate risk. They would not have to calculate exchange rates and so it would be to their advantage if the euro gained in importance. Your second question was how that could be done. Well, we could create circumstances that would make it easier to use the euro as a currency. Infrastructure, more payments in euro, would then mean fewer risks. That could be achieved by promoting the capital markets union, by advancing the banking union, by harmonising insolvency regimes. All of these things help enormously.   You are listening to Deutschlandfunk’s interview of the week, today with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the ECB’s Executive Board. Ms Lautenschläger, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates shortly before Christmas, for the fourth time this year. They are now between 2.25% and 2.5%. The ECB is taking no action at all on interest rates, why not?  The US economy is different, as are US price developments. It is not our task to copy the Federal Reserve; our mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area…  But many people are waiting on an interest rate hike here, too.  Yes, some people are waiting while others are very happy that the interest rates for housing construction in Germany or for investment in companies, in new jobs, remain low. It completely depends on whom you ask, Mr Kindermann.  Yes, there are many savers who are concerned about their pension plans because interest rates are simply not going up. What would you say to them?   Well, I’m a saver myself. I understand their position very well and I will be the first to vote in favour of further normalisation of monetary policy once the necessary conditions are in place. Our asset purchase programme ends in January. That means we have taken a first step towards the normalisation of monetary policy and I hope that the data that we receive in 2019 will be such that we can take further steps in 2019.   When you say the end of the asset purchase programme, it's actually not the end at all, because the ECB is still blithely purchasing assets. It just means that no additional assets are being purchased, but those maturing will be replaced. So we can't actually say that this programme is stopping.  We're stopping net purchases. This means that our balance sheet will not increase any further. We will keep it stable in the first instance because an expansionary, accommodative monetary policy is still needed to stimulate investments, including in Germany, and to continue to support economic growth in order to achieve inflation rates within our very narrow corridor of below, but close to, 2%.  Will you also continue to purchase corporate bonds?  We will continue to purchase maturing corporate bonds and then reinvest again.  Even corporate bonds?  Yes.  But with these steps it will take a relatively long time to return to normality. Is it perhaps possible that you've already missed the turning point? The Federal Reserve is already much further ahead. Interest rates can only be reduced to combat a possible recession if they have previously been raised.   Yes, but the United States is in a completely different stage of its economic cycle. Its economy is much more mature, and its economic upturn started much earlier than ours and has been going on for much longer. The inflation rates you see in the United States are much more stable, exactly where the Federal Reserve wants them.   But here in the euro area, inflation has also been where you'd actually like it to be at for several months now.  Yes, but you need to look further ahead. You can't just look at the current month or one or two or three months ahead. You need to look at how prices develop over a longer period looking forward. Otherwise you would have to change the interest rates every month, and I don't think that would do the economy any good. You'll also see that the inflation rates are projected to fall again next year. This is because some effects, particularly those resulting from higher energy costs, drop out of the calculation after a year ‒ this is called the base effect.  But then we will have to wait even longer for interest rates to increase here in the euro area.   We have to see how the situation develops.  Do you think that interest rates will increase above 0.0% in 2019?  It depends on the price inflation data we receive in the first and second quarters of 2019. Personally, I hope and assume that we will see a change in 2019, but I won't try to suggest I know exactly where we'll be, say, in the middle of next year.  When will savings interest rates increase for savers, provided that interest rates are raised in 2019?  It all depends on which interest rate adjustments are made and how quickly the institutions pass them on. But for deposits interest rates are actually negative, and so it will obviously take longer to increase these gradually (as this cannot be done in one go) to a level that resembles where rates for savers were 10 or 20 years ago. It will take some time to be honest.  So savers still have to wait another one or two years?  Again, it depends on how the inflation rate develops.   In the United States we're seeing signs of a recession. Yields on longer-term government bonds in the United States are sometimes lower than the yields on those with shorter maturities, which is a completely abnormal situation. Normally you get more money the longer you lend. This is what is referred to as an inverted yield curve. This has happened eight times since the Second World War. In the United States this has always resulted in a recession. The Federal Reserve is already actively preparing itself for a recession. What is the ECB doing to protect us here in the euro area from a downturn?  Once again, the US economy has achieved a different level of maturity. The country's upswing started much earlier – years earlier – and was much stronger.  But a recession in the United States would also affect us here in Europe.  Yes, but if you take a look, we have become much more independent. So I wouldn't want to draw or confirm the same parallels that you saw in the economic cycles 20 or 30 years ago for today. The euro area economy is much more diversified in terms of partners, in terms of trading partners, and we are no longer quite as dependent. We are in a different economic cycle. So you can mention US interest rates another 150 times, but it's not going to help us, because we need to base our assumptions on data in the euro area.  You are listening to Deutschlandfunk's interview of the week, today with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the ECB's Executive Board. Ms Lautenschläger, you're not only a member of the ECB's Executive Board, but also Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB. I would therefore like to put the question to you: are our banks safer than they used to be?  Yes, they are. They have much more, and higher-quality, capital. They hold much larger liquidity reserves. Risk management practices have improved. So yes, a lot has been done in the euro area, and even internationally, as a lot of rules have been changed and tightened globally. They are therefore safer.  Banks really like to buy government bonds, as these are given a zero risk weighting. As such, banks currently do not need to hold a loss buffer for these bonds. Is this the next problem waiting to happen, especially for Italian and Spanish banks?  I can tell you that the institutions have all actually reduced their shares of government bonds in the last ten years.  Would they not still have to back these with capital?  I agree with you here – I am very much in favour of institutions backing risks with capital and also taking into account concentration risk, i.e. considering the amount of specific government bonds an institution has per country.  Ms Lautenschläger, on the subject of Brexit the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warns that an unregulated Brexit on 29 March 2019 would have massive consequences for the economy. According to Mr Carney, it could cause more damage than the financial crisis did ten years ago. What provisions has the ECB made for the event of an unregulated Brexit?  Of course, we have looked at all of the possible consequences for the financial sector in depth, particularly for banks. This is because, as a central bank, we naturally maintain an overview of the financial sector and, as a banking supervisor, we supervise banks. And I can tell you that there are obviously still risks in this respect. You should therefore never just sit back and relax and stop watching what's going on. But I think we're also quite well prepared. We've been working to prepare institutions for two years, ensuring they submit contingency plans and alternative options, for example for certain trading activities. The European Commission is working on a regulation on clearing and payment processing, for example. So I think we're well prepared, at least as well prepared as you can be in such situations.  The British pound will probably end up crashing.  No one knows that.  No one knows that, but the Bank of England is expecting it in any case. That means you'll also be asked about it.  We’re not responsible for the pound; we look after the euro here.  But there's an exchange rate between the pound and the euro.  Yes, but again, I think it's better that Mark Carney speaks for the pound and we speak for the euro.  How many foreign banks have already applied for a banking licence in Germany to retain access to the European markets after Brexit? Can you give a figure?  I think it's around 20, if I'm not mistaken, and we're in regular contact with 40 institutions. Some only need their licence extended, some need a completely new licence and some don't need a licence at all, but want to substantially expand the business that's covered by their existing licence, and this all obviously also entails work, as we then impose other conditions on their set-up here in the European market.  Will Frankfurt, Germany's financial centre, become more important after Brexit?  Yes.  Why?  Because quite a few banks will move parts of their business from London to Frankfurt, or to Paris, Amsterdam or Dublin, so not only to Germany's financial centre. London will always be a very important financial centre, but continental European business above all will be relocated in part – and perhaps to a larger extent over the years – to Germany, France, Ireland and Spain, and therefore also jobs.  And finally, the eight-year term of the current President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, will be coming to an end at the end of October 2019. Has the time not come for a woman to head the ECB?  The time is ripe to appoint women to all kinds of positions, not only at the ECB. There are lots I could list.  But also at the ECB?  Yes.  The previous ECB presidents have come from the Netherlands, France and Italy. Shouldn’t it be Germany's turn next?  I don't see it so much from a national perspective. First and foremost I'd like to have someone – a man or a woman (a woman would of course be nice) – who is an established expert in monetary policy and ensures stability. I think that's really important, and then nationality takes more of a backseat, as we're not working as representatives of our own countries, but as representatives of the euro area as Europeans.  Mr Draghi has had to navigate through a number of crises during his time at the ECB. What do you think are the most important qualities a new ECB president needs to have?  As I said, definitely expertise in monetary policy and national economy, steadfastness, stamina, strategic thinking, and I think a talent for communications is extremely important.  In that case, wouldn't Deutsche Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann be the right candidate?  I'm sure there are several people who possess these specific skills, but Mr Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, also has these skills, yes.  Ms Lautenschläger, thank you for the interview.    "
2018-11-26,Sabine Lautenschläger,Interview with Agence France-Presse,"Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Agence France-Presse on 22 November 2018 and published on 26 November 2018","  Interview with Agence France-Presse   Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Agence France-Presse on 22 November 2018 and published on 26 November 2018  The European economy has slowed down in recent months and external risks are growing. Will the ECB stick to its plan to end net asset purchases next month?  The incoming data are somewhat weaker than expected, but economic growth is overall within our projections. I am confident that we will reach our objective of an inflation rate below, but close to, 2.0%. That's why we should decide to exit the net purchases in December as anticipated. Despite the uncertainties that have increased in the last six months, right now I don't see anything on the horizon that could change this assessment in the next three weeks. It is time to gradually normalize monetary policy.  Will the ECB also be able to raise interest rates before President Mario Draghi leaves next October?  Our policy decisions are data driven. Based on the current information I am confident that we will raise key interest rates next year. It might be in the summer or in the autumn, depending on the input we get from incoming data.  Isn't it dangerous to withdraw support from the economy just when the horizon is darkening?  The outlook has not changed significantly. Risks are still broadly balanced and with our monetary policy, in particular with the reinvestment of the maturing assets, we will provide ample support to the economy. Extending the net purchase programme would not bring significant additional benefits, but it would increase negative side effects. The reinvestments will act as a sufficient stimulus. This, in addition to all the other measures we have in place – the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, low key interest rates, the full allotment policy, among others – will ensure that there is still an expansionary, accommodative monetary policy.  Will the ECB make changes to its bond-buying criteria in the new year, to maximize the impact of the reinvestments?  With regard to the reinvestments, I think we should use well-established, known criteria, such as the capital key and limits on the issuer and the issuance. We should not bind ourselves for a long period of time with regard to the reinvestments, as we cannot exclude the possibility that we will reach our inflation objective earlier than expected or that there will be an increase in negative side effects from our expansionary monetary policy.  Is quantitative easing (QE) a tool the ECB could use again in the future, as some current and former Governing Council members have suggested?  In the context of a monetary union with many different sovereigns and no fiscal, genuine economic and political union, QE should not be part of the normal policy toolbox. It should be a tool of last resort, to be used only when there is a clear risk of deflation. With a long-lasting, very accommodative monetary policy, side effects and risks emerge. And while pursuing price stability is the main objective, we also have to keep in mind the costs – and not only the benefits – of our monetary policy measures.   What danger does the row between Rome and Brussels over the Italian budget present for the country's banking system?  As a banking supervisor it's not our task to comment on political discussions or decisions with regard to the budgets and fiscal stances of individual countries. Banks have to acknowledge changes and risks in the macroeconomic environment they operate in. And if these changes are relevant, we as supervisors adapt our assessment of banks’ risk profiles, too. Overall, the Italian banking system has become more resilient and banks are better equipped to deal with uncertainties than they were before.  What do you see as the top priority for banking supervision in the coming months and years, in Italy and elsewhere?  Among other topics, there is still further work to do on non-performing loans. They will keep us busy for the coming years. The cleaning up of banks’ balance sheets should be pushed through as quickly as possible. This is not specific to Italy. All banks should do their utmost to improve their resilience in sunny times when the economic cycle is on the upside. Not all banks have done all of the work we would like them to do. Some are well under way, and some still need to do much more.  Some observers are disappointed that a male candidate – Italy's Andrea Enria – will take over as head of ECB Banking Supervision from Danièle Nouy next year, rather than Irishwoman Sharon Donnery. How did you feel about the news?  I hope that our ratio of women in central banking, as well as in banking supervision, will increase. I’m convinced that diversity in management positions is an intelligent idea to pursue.   "
2018-11-22,Peter Praet,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 19 November 2018 and published on 23 November 2018","  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 19 November 2018 and published on 23 November 2018  Mr Praet, economic sentiment indicators have recently fallen steeply and markets are increasingly nervous. How concerned are you about the euro area economy?   Growth in the euro area is normalising. We shouldn’t forget that it was exceptionally high over the past two years. That was mainly due to the strength of the export sector. Following the turbulence in financial markets in China in mid-2015, central banks and fiscal authorities around the world conducted expansionary policies, and this supported trade. The momentum from exports has now abated. There are also a number of risks, such as protectionism, vulnerabilities in some emerging markets and financial market volatility.  What impact are the trade disputes having?  Our main scenario is that trade conflicts would be mainly confined to the United States and China. Moreover, one of the United States’ main concerns is to improve the protection of intellectual property. We are not yet seeing much of an impact on sentiment in the euro area, but that could change, of course.  How great are the risks of Brexit, of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU?  The risks related to a hard Brexit should not be underestimated. The consequences would be greater for the United Kingdom than they would be for the euro area, but we would feel it here too – the United Kingdom isn’t a small country.  The German economy contracted in the third quarter. What is your assessment of that?  The new emissions tests for the car industry had a significant impact in the third quarter, mainly in Germany. This matter may also affect the reputation of the companies involved. But we agree with the Bundesbank, which expects output to recover in the fourth quarter.  We’ve talked about a number of serious risks now, but the ECB still believes that positive and negative risks are balanced. Why is that?  The downside risks have increased, but at this stage we still think that the picture remains broadly balanced. In the case of some risks, things may turn out better than feared. A Brexit agreement with the United Kingdom, for example, could improve sentiment. And the trade disputes may eventually subside. But uncertainty has clearly increased, and this is unfortunately likely to have a dampening effect on investment.  Doesn’t that mean that the balance of risks is on the negative side?   I believe it is too soon for a negative assessment, because many issues are of a binary nature, resulting in either a “good” or a “bad” outcome. This makes any risk assessment challenging. Also, any statement by a central bank that downside risks prevail must result from a thorough assessment, not least because of high market sensitivity to any change in our communication.  Markets have been pretty volatile recently. What does that mean for the ECB?  Our monetary policy has significantly helped to stabilise financing conditions for firms and households and shield them from developments in China, the United States and emerging market economies, for example. It was mainly stock prices that were affected; interest rates have been fairly stable overall – except in Italy.  Euro area inflation has risen recently, so many people – especially in Germany – are asking why the ECB is sticking to its accommodative monetary policy.  Our mandate is to safeguard sustainable price stability in the euro area. This means that the rate of inflation must reach our aim of below, but close to, 2% in a sustained manner. At the moment, the increase is mainly related to the higher oil price. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has for some time been around 1%, sometimes even lower, and that’s not enough to reach our aim in a sustained manner. We are confident that underlying inflation pressures are rising, but it will take time and it requires monetary policy to remain accommodative.  Are there any indications that this is happening?  We see that wages are increasing, and we expect that this will feed through into higher prices in six to twelve months.  Will Germans have to come to terms with price increases of more than 2%?  Price developments in Germany will probably be at the upper end of the range in the euro area, but I doubt they will be much above the 2% mark.  So far, the higher oil price has been the main contributing factor to inflation, but recently it has recorded a significant fall. Is that not dampening inflation too?  A higher oil price pushes up inflation but dampens growth. Lower oil prices have precisely the opposite effect. When many economists were predicting that oil prices would go above 100 dollars a few weeks ago, that had me worried. But the current level is good for growth in the euro area.  How big are the problems in Italy, in your view?  Financing conditions there have tightened. Short-term rates have remained low, but longer-term rates have risen considerably, and stocks are under pressure – especially those of banks, which have fallen by more than 30%. Banks will eventually have to pass on the tighter conditions they are facing to customers. Our estimates show that this will offset – possibly more than offset – any positive impact resulting from higher government spending.  Is there a risk of recession?  Italy’s current financing conditions are much too tight for a country with weak growth and low inflation. Italy needs supply-side reforms to improve productivity. The European Commission has always been relatively open to the idea of allowing higher government spending in the event of such measures being taken. But we have not seen much happening on that front – it’s mainly about higher spending. And this has led to much higher risk premia that if protracted, would, in my view, have detrimental effects on the economy.  Could there be a situation where the ECB would have to intervene?  We conduct monetary policy not for individual countries, but for the euro area as a whole. Italy is a large economy, but so far there have been no real contagion effects for other countries. Financing conditions in the euro area as a whole remain very good. And so our monetary policy assessment is unchanged for the time being.  So does that mean in other words that the ECB would step in if contagion effects occurred?   We would have to analyse the situation. The appropriate instrument would be what’s known as Outright Monetary Transactions. Under this programme, the ECB would make targeted purchases of the relevant country’s sovereign debt subject to certain conditions. But we would not even contemplate this move unless that country applies for assistance from the European Stability Mechanism, the ESM rescue fund, and accepts its conditions.  At present, however, people are also speculating about new targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTROs, for banks. Might this not lead to misunderstandings, as it seems reasonable to assume that these operations are motivated by a desire to support Italy?  The TLTROs are a monetary instrument and we conduct monetary policy for the whole euro area. We carried out TLTROs for banks in 2014 and 2016 in order to shore up weak lending. In the meantime, lending has improved and fragmentation within the euro area has practically disappeared.   But could new TLTROs be needed all the same?  If these loans have a residual maturity of at least one year, the banking supervisor categorises them as long-term financing. The first TLTRO tranche expires in June 2020. This will start to have effects on the net stable funding ratio as of mid-2019. The banks are aware of this and they have been preparing themselves for it. It is premature to decide on a new TLTRO now.  As of January, the ECB no longer wants to make net asset purchases but only to replace maturing securities. How exactly will that be done in practice?   The principle is that we take a market-neutral approach. In December we will discuss the guidelines for our reinvestments.  You have said that forward guidance on monetary policy will become the ECB’s most important instrument in 2019. This will also increase dependency on the markets. How long will this go on for?   Forward guidance is particularly important as long as the economy still requires support and the central bank’s policy rate is at its effective lower bound. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed at present. We expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In due course, when monetary policy begins to normalise and uncertainty abates, forward guidance will also lose importance as a monetary policy instrument.  Will the first step be to increase the interest rate on the ECB’s deposit facility from -0.40% or the interest rate on the main refinancing operations from 0.00% – or both at the same time?   The rate on our deposit facility is currently decisive for the market rate, and so for the transmission of our monetary policy signal, because the banks are operating in an environment of excess liquidity. As that situation will continue for some time to come, the deposit facility rate remains the most important monetary policy instrument. However, it is still too early to discuss any adjustment to our key interest rates and their constellation.  Let’s look beyond monetary policy. What do you see as the most serious deficiencies of the euro area?   The Franco-German agreement on a fiscal capacity is welcome and also has important political significance for European integration. Building up the ESM rescue fund is more urgent. We also need to complete the banking union and the capital markets union without undue delay.  The banking union envisages a common deposit insurance scheme. Germany has serious misgivings that this would amount to risk-sharing.  A common deposit insurance is essential for the completion of the banking union and to underpin the confidence of all depositors in the financial system. This protection of deposits up to €100,000 will be funded by contributions from banks. But this scheme is just one of the components that are necessary to make the banking sector more resilient and safeguard financial stability. It is of the utmost importance to implement the rules for bank resolution which stipulate that at least 8% of banks’ liabilities should be made up of instruments that could absorb losses in the event of bank failure. In my view, all of these instruments should be either equity or subordinated bonds so that all customer deposits would be effectively protected.  We have now talked a lot about problems. Let’s now ask what you see as the greatest achievement of the euro?  Citizens have overwhelmingly embraced the euro. People appreciate how it brings Europeans closer together. Many aspects of everyday life have become easier, such as doing business or travelling. The level of acceptance is high in all euro area countries.  Let’s look ahead: your term of office expires at the end of May. Do you have any regrets?   I am confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term will proceed. I will be here for another six months, and I expect to see further progress towards our aim by the end of my mandate, but I will clearly have to leave before the normalisation of our monetary policy. To be successful in our monetary policy we need to be patient, prudent and persistent.   "
2018-11-02,Peter Praet,"Interview with BdP Revista, staff magazine of Banco de Portugal","Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabel Arriaga e Cunha on 18 June 2018 and published on 2 November 2018","  Interview with BdP Revista, staff magazine of Banco de Portugal    Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabel Arriaga e Cunha on 18 June 2018 and published on 2 November 2018  Europe is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the European Central Bank (ECB), and in a few months the 20th anniversary of the euro. What do you think are the main achievements and successes of these 20 years?  20 years ago the responsibility for monetary policy was entrusted to a new European institution with the mandate of maintaining price stability. This was a major step forward in the process of building an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe. We are a European institution that has been capable of deciding and acting in good times as well as in very challenging times. This is a remarkable achievement from an institutional point of view. And we have fulfilled our mandate in very difficult times – despite the financial and economic crises during the last decade. The euro is a stable and safe currency. We see with 74% in the Eurobarometer the highest approval rating for the single currency since 2004. That is quite remarkable, even more so as there are strong political forces challenging European integration.  So, you see the ECB as having lived up to its responsibility so far?  The ECB has had three presidents over 20 years. There have sometimes been differences. This is quite normal within a decision-making body of today 25 members, but the Governing Council has always enjoyed a strong sense of collegiality. We are all fully committed to fulfilling our mandate and are always open to debate and each other’s ideas. This is why the ECB has always had the ability and the willingness to act, whenever it was needed and within its mandate. So, back to your question: what are the main successes of these 20 years? The euro was created, because the single currency is a necessary condition for the completion of the Single Market. This remains true, but you need more than the single currency for the Single Market to function properly: once you have a single currency with a single market with free mobility of labour, goods and services, you are urged to reach a higher degree of political integration. There is a need for more European integration. This integration can take time, it will not come overnight, but each politician should keep in mind that further integration is necessary. If we didn’t agree on this need and we neglected the high degree of interdependence between Member States, we would run the risk of going backwards – and that would probably be in a brutal way. In this sense, the sovereign debt crisis acted as a wake-up call and led to substantial steps forward in European integration, including the creation of the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Supervisory Mechanism.   The ECB is a federal institution where competences, such as competition and trade policies, are European, as you said. Does that mean that the euro can only survive in a federal setting, a federal union?  To put it very simply: in the long run Europeans will decide as much as possible in local communities and countries, and will decide jointly at a European level whenever necessary. That is the principle of subsidiarity. Which decision-making belongs to which level is up for debate.   The euro is the currency of the European Union. To reap the full benefit of Monetary Union, it is essential to put in place a sound institutional framework for other policies, where responsibilities are assigned to the right level. Some policies, but certainly not all, are best assigned to the Union level. This is a long process, and the Union has already demonstrated its ability to make progress.  There was a high degree of consensus after the financial crisis that banks would be best supervised at the Union level. The responsibility for banking supervision was accordingly assigned to the Union level, following a decision taken by the European Council in June 2012. In some policy areas, rules are not sufficient, you also need institutions. Crisis management is another example. The rules that we had before the crisis didn’t even foresee the possibility of a crisis, and this made the response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis particularly challenging. Lessons were learnt from this painful experience and a permanent institution for crisis management was established, the European Stability Mechanism.  Assigning monetary policy to the Union level was relatively easy, because there is a broad social consensus on central banking whereby the central bank should be independent and be assigned the pursuit of a single objective, price stability. Defining the right allocation of responsibilities between the Union and its Member States is by nature a long historical process; it will continue to elicit lively political debates in Europe. Such debates are to be welcomed, as they are part of our writing a common history.  Is the ECB’s mandate enough for a single currency? For example, shouldn’t its mandate include the role of lender of last resort?  The role of lender of last resort is a traditional role for central banks and we fulfil it. This contributes to financial stability. The problem is that some economists and some politicians say that the central bank should stand ready to finance government deficits. This is incompatible with the mandate of a price stability-oriented central bank. This is why in the Treaty there are clauses prohibiting monetary financing and guaranteeing central bank independence. In a monetary union, it is however important to have institutions that can support Member States confronted with serious financial difficulties. If you don’t have that you face the permanent risk of instability. This is one of the lessons of the crisis and was the reason for creating the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a permanent crisis management institution.  For the ESM to properly play its role, shouldn’t it become a European institution, with joint decision-making at the “community” level? I mean, a federal institution instead of the present intergovernmental institution?  It is essential for successful crisis management to have an efficient decision-making procedure, because crisis management requires effective and quick action. Crises risk being exacerbated by decision rules, such as unanimity, that prevent timely decisions from being taken and cast doubt on the effectiveness of crisis management institutions. Decision-making procedures of a federal nature are in this sense preferable to intergovernmental ones that often come with veto rights.  In Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), emergency funding is basically provided subject to conditionality on economic and fiscal policies. It is not a transfer; rather, financial support is granted to smooth the adjustment process.   Is this the correct way to deal with potential crises?  I think so. It is a responsibility of Member States to consider their economic policies as a matter of common interest and ensure sustainable public finances. Adverse economic developments can put a Member State under financial stress and bring about a need for reform. Ill-designed policies, fiscal profligacy for example, can also eventually lead a country into crisis. It is a collective responsibility of Member States to ensure a smooth functioning of EMU and this is why they agreed that a crisis management framework was needed.   The EMU Member States have lost the traditional adjustment tools to deal with shocks – such as the devaluation of their currency – whilst EMU had no proper crisis management instruments…  That’s true. Our Economic and Monetary Union was not complete when the crisis hit us. When the crisis came, some countries had weak public finances. Doubts about their creditworthiness led markets to require higher risk premia, thereby stretching even further their public finances. These countries then fell into a vicious circle whereby expectations of them not being able to repay their debt pushed up interest rates and, as in a self-fulfilling prophecy, those higher refinancing rates made their public finances look increasingly unsustainable, thereby leading to a liquidity crisis. If you have a conditional lending facility, a country cannot be pushed into a liquidity crisis based on self-fulfilling market expectations, because markets know there is a facility to cater for a lack of liquidity. This calms down speculation too.  But then, states in difficulty will get even more indebted…  No, because you don’t necessarily need to use these facilities. The fact that there is a backstop can, by itself, prevent speculative attacks based on self-fulfilling market expectations. It is important to stress that to access liquidity facilities, such as those provided by the ESM, countries have to accept policy conditionality, to agree on implementing an adjustment programme. But it is true that, when the crisis came, there was a blame game between current account surplus and deficit countries.   Shouldn’t this be recognised at last?  It is true that during the crisis there was some asymmetry in the adjustment mechanism. Historically, the deficit countries have always been weaker than the surplus countries. But there is an important point one should keep in mind. What would have happened if the crisis had happened without our Monetary Union guaranteeing capital mobility? For example, when the Spanish or Portuguese banking systems were in difficulty, Dutch and German creditors were still paid back. The counterfactual would have been that controls on the movements of capital would have been imposed and there would have been a sort of debt renegotiation – but this didn’t happen thanks to the currency union. With the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) we now have burden-sharing mechanisms for the creditors.   Talking about the BRRD, isn’t it dangerous that the banking union remains an incomplete project?  We should not stay in the middle of the river for too long. That’s why we need a clear roadmap to complete the banking union relatively soon – not tomorrow, but in a not-too-distant future. It is abnormal that the supervision responsibility is collective but the consequences, if something goes wrong, go back to the national authorities. I’ve said very often that we have to go further. But on the other hand you hear that there are legacy portfolios from the past, and before you can go forward into the banking union, the issue of non-performing loans (NPLs) has to be addressed.  The countries that complain are mainly the ones that had the opportunity to clean up their banks with public money before 2013, when the European state aid rules were in abeyance. Now their banks have been cleaned up, whilst the banks in some other countries that were the main ones to suffer from the economic crisis face a huge NPL legacy which, politically, prevents the banking union from progressing. Is this fair?  It’s true that some countries put a lot of public money into the banking system during the crisis. Germany’s support for its banking sector had an impact on its public debt of more than 10% of GDP at the peak. Now it’s lower, because most of the money has been recovered. In a country like Italy, the difficulties came later, after the rules had changed. The transition to the new rules could have been better designed.  Does this endless discussion on risk reduction before any progress in risk-sharing make sense?  Banks today remain mainly exposed to the national economy and the national debt. The “doom loop” between banks and sovereigns has not yet been fully severed. One way to improve risk-sharing is cross-border consolidation. This doesn’t mean that we no longer need local banks. Local banks are still very important for the financing of the economy, but there is a need for consolidation. The regulation doesn’t incentivise banks to do that, because of the capital and liquidity requirements for subsidiaries.  It is also important to have more internationally diversified bank bondholders, so as to prevent a situation in which only creditors located in a specific country are affected in the event of a bank failure.  What we really need today is a clear end-point. What would it mean for a bank to eventually be in a complete banking union, and when is this going to happen? There is still too much uncertainty for banks to think Europe-wide and to consolidate across borders, and I think that’s a problem.  EMU was launched with a promise of peace, security and prosperity, and that it would accelerate the EU’s political integration. What went wrong?  European integration is a process, and it is important to learn from the experience so far to make further progress. I would like to stress two points. First, EMU came with too-high expectations, for example that the growth rates we had just before, or at the beginning of, EMU would continue forever. Many borrowed on the basis of those optimistic expectations. So there was a basic fragility in debt markets. The second thing was the absence of mechanisms to deal with debt overhangs. The crisis was the motivation for establishing the banking union and improving financial sector regulation.  On your question: did the Union deliver prosperity and security? The Single Market is a source of prosperity and it needs a single currency. The currency crises of the 1990s were very detrimental to the internal market. Just remember the big exchange rate crisis we had before the Monetary Union in 1992-93. In Belgium, for example, people were importing Italian cars directly from Italy, where prices were much cheaper. It was possible to do that in the internal market. Then the car dealers and repair outlets in Belgium started to discriminate against these cars because they were not bought in Belgium. When going to a garage for maintenance, the car was put on a waiting list. In practice, non-tariff barriers were put up in response to the exchange rate effect. And that was jeopardising the very principle of the internal market.   You would say then that for countries most hit by the crisis, such as Portugal or Greece, it would have been even worse if they were not in the euro?  I think so. For small open economies, exchange rates can be very destabilising. That is why smaller economies usually try to peg their exchange rates to a stable currency. In the Monetary Union, insufficient attention was paid to competitiveness divergences, because such divergences build up over time, little by little, and at some point there is a need for a significant adjustment. We should have paid more attention to economic divergences.   Why?  It is important for sound economic policymaking to identify at an early stage the erosion of competitiveness. For example, we should understand why Germany was able to increase the value added in manufacturing during the crisis, while in other countries manufacturing suffered. What happened? Why did German manufacturers do better? The decentralisation of labour negotiations at the firm level proved to be useful to cushion the impact of the crisis. Why did the German unions collaborate to have contracts at the firm level? You also have to look at the fiscal situation, and at education and training. In Germany, you have a lot of jobs, but at the same time inequality has increased. In France, it’s the opposite: less inequality but higher unemployment. It is important to understand much better these developments so as to design better economic policies.  European citizens seem to be increasingly disaffected with Europe. In many countries people feel poorer, they are tired of austerity, and they blame Europe, as is happening, for example, in Italy. Everywhere voters are increasingly turning to anti-European parties. How dangerous can this be for the European project?   I think most people realise that the European level is essential. A large majority of people agree that Europe can provide better answers to certain international problems. For example in Italy, according to the Eurobarometer, people say migration should be dealt with at the European level. Think about the threat of protectionism and the necessary response to it, climate change or preserving the environment: people believe these things should be dealt with collectively, because that is how we can make our voice heard on a global stage. But then they feel disappointed in some cases by the inability of the EU Member States to decide together and perceive the discussion between Member States as a game of shifting problems to neighbours. And the reaction is then often: well, let’s do it at the national level because at the European level it doesn’t work. My point is: Europe can provide the right answers, but all of us have to meet our responsibilities.   But what if the Europeans feel tempted to try something different?  Most people understand the risks and what we would lose by giving up the objective of an ever-closer union. All of us would become weaker and eventually less influential. If we want to decide about how we want to live, we have to decide together. If we want to preserve our sovereignty, we have to share it. We should think European and move forward.    "
2018-10-01,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Der Tagesspiegel,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Carla Neuhaus on 19 September 2018 published on 1 October 2018","  Interview with Der Tagesspiegel   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Carla Neuhaus on 19 September 2018 published on 1 October 2018  Mr Cœuré, the financial crisis erupted 10 years ago. Is the eurozone now better prepared for a crisis?  As central bankers we always need to be prepared for the next crisis. It is our job to make the financial system as resilient as possible. And a lot has been done on that front. The financial system is now much safer than it was 10 years ago. We have better regulation and higher capital and liquidity buffers in banks. Good progress has been made, but we are not there yet.  Why not?  There are still parts of the financial system that are not nearly as well regulated as we would like them to be. I’m thinking of the shadow banking sector, for example, meaning financial institutions that conduct activities similar to those of banks but don’t have a banking licence. Regulators still don’t have proper instruments to adequately monitor and control risks in these institutions.  It would be up to politicians to change that. But are they still ready to do so, 10 years after the start of the crisis?  There is indeed a risk of complacency. After all, the economy is doing well, memories of the crisis are fading, and bankers have been trying again and again to soften regulation. We have to continue to defend the rules that have made the financial system less crisis-prone.   How well prepared are we then?  The next crisis might not necessarily start in the financial system. It might come from another quarter instead. At the ECB, we are currently looking closely at cybersecurity, for example. We don’t want the next crisis to be triggered by a hacker. Continued investment is needed to protect the financial system from cyberattacks.  What is the ECB doing in this respect?  For example, we have set up a Euro Cyber Resilience Board, which is a forum for regular discussion and cooperation between central bankers, supervisors and providers of critical financial infrastructures. We have designed a European framework for red-team testing in the financial sector, Tiber-EU. And cybersecurity is also becoming more important for ECB Banking Supervision. Credit institutions have to report any attacks on their systems. Those are just a few examples. The next few years will bring many more initiatives on this front, also at the G7 and G20 levels. After all, cyber threats don’t stop at borders.  Bitcoin and the like are giving rise to new crypto currencies and new risks. Do we need regulation in this area?   I prefer to speak of crypto assets rather than currencies – if anything, their volatility clearly disqualifies them as currencies. The priority is to prevent them from being used to launder money and finance terrorism. Europe has already made good progress on this with the fifth EU anti-money laundering directive, which obliges providers of cryptocurrencies platforms and wallets to report conspicuous transactions to the authorities. When it comes to the use of new technologies such as blockchain, we need to weigh things up carefully. On the one hand, similar activities should be regulated in a similar way, so the requirements for (say) blockchain transactions need to be similarly stringent to those for traditional transfers. On the other hand, we should be careful not to stifle new, innovative technologies.   Some central banks are thinking about developing their own cryptocurrencies. The ECB as well?   Whether central banks should develop their own digital currencies is a relevant question in countries where people are turning away from cash. There is then a case for offering them a digital alternative safer than commercial money. This is why we are seeing such initiatives in Scandinavia, for example. But in the euro area, cash remains a popular means of payment and the question does not arise. To be clear: the ECB is not developing a crypto currency. That said, as all central banks, we are studying in depth the underlying technologies, such as blockchain.  Cyber security is just one of the risks currently facing the economy. Another is the escalating trade dispute. How well prepared is Europe on this front?   The euro area economy is proving very robust at the moment. There have been five years of uninterrupted growth. And we believe that growth will remain resilient, despite all the uncertainties. But trade disputes and, more generally, declining support for the multilateral order make strengthening Europe an urgent task. And strengthening Europe includes strengthening the euro area.   So do we need a eurozone budget, for example, as Merkel and Macron have suggested?  Germany and France have put forward interesting ideas in this respect. If properly designed (that is, if it complements sound national fiscal policies), a common euro area budget could help to dampen the impact of large economic downturns and make the economy less dependent on the ECB’s monetary policy. But it cannot and should not be the only way to make the euro area stronger.   What needs to happen first?  First of all, we need responsible fiscal policies and economic reform in all Member States. Many euro area countries still don’t have the fiscal space to support their economies in the event of a crisis, and their economies are not well prepared to long term challenges. So in my view, reform at the national level is the first line of defence. Second, we need to complete the banking union and the capital market union to strengthen our single market and better fund innovation and growth. A common fiscal capacity is a useful complement, but it only comes third.   What is still missing from banking union is a shared deposit insurance scheme. But this is a controversial topic in Germany. Savers are afraid that Germany could at some point end up being liable for the collapse of, say, an Italian bank. What would you say to that?  A European deposit guarantee scheme is not about paying for other countries. It does not mean permanent transfers and it does not mean new taxes. A European scheme would increase confidence in banks and help them to operate on a pan-European basis, supporting the Single Market and hence growth and jobs. At the same time, it is of course important to keep reducing risks in European banks, in particular when it comes to non-performing loans.  Savers need to be patient. The ECB has decided that it won’t raise interest rates before the summer of 2019. Why can’t it happen sooner?  The euro area economy is growing and unemployment has fallen significantly. Price pressures are gradually picking up. But this doesn’t happen in one day. Ample monetary stimulus will remain needed to support a sustained convergence of euro area inflation towards our aim of below, but close to 2%. In other words: monetary normalisation has started, but it is a gradual one. We expect interest rates to stay at the current level at least through the summer of 2019. But we have already started to reduce our net asset purchases and anticipate to end them after the end of December. That is an important step towards normalisation.  What role does Brexit play in your planning?   As a central bank, we have to be prepared for all contingencies. And likewise, the financial sector should prepare for the worst: a no-deal Brexit. At the same time, I hope, of course, that Europe and the United Kingdom will find an agreement allowing for a transition period that gives everyone time to prepare for an orderly Brexit.  I would like to end with a personal question. The ECB needs a new President next year. Would that be a job for you?  No one can “apply” to become the ECB President. It’s in the hands of Heads of States and governments, and that discussion has not started.

2018-09-05,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Kathimerini,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eirini Chrysolora and published on 5 September 2018","  Interview with Kathimerini   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Eirini Chrysolora and published on 5 September 2018  Does the completion of the programme mark a new era for Greece in your view? Is enhanced surveillance not just a continuation of the programme?   Let me start by saying that it would be all too easy to take the opportunity of Greece graduating from the programme to turn the page and say “mission accomplished”. The programme years have been very difficult for the Greek people. Policymakers across Europe have a duty to learn the lessons of this painful journey and improve policy, at both European and national levels. With hindsight, one can argue that the design of the programmes could have been more effective in supporting social safety nets and combating rent-seeking, that the pace of reform of the financial sector could have been faster, and that the need for debt reduction was overlooked by creditors. All this has gradually improved over time. I would like to congratulate the Greek government for its remarkable work in recent years, implementing key reforms in the economy and the society in general and in the financial sector in particular. For example, social solidarity income helps direct scarce resources to those who need them most, and opening up industries or sectors, such as pharmacies, benefits households which have borne the brunt of crisis adjustment. Regarding the financial sector more specifically, the new legislative framework provides much better support for reducing non-performing loans (NPLs) compared with the situation a couple of years ago. This will help banks support economic growth and job creation more effectively. But let’s not forget where it all started. Never again should a euro area country end up in such an unsustainable position as Greece’s in 2010. We need responsible national fiscal and economic policies, and a better euro area governance framework. As for enhanced surveillance, it is not a new programme but rather a strengthened form of cooperation between Greece, the European institutions and the euro area countries to support the transition towards full market access. Make no mistake, the burden of gaining the trust of markets and depositors has now fully shifted to the Greek government. Don’t expect building trust among investors to be easier than convincing the institutions.  What will be the ECB’s role in the context of enhanced surveillance? Will you provide your contribution as in the past?  We will remain involved in the enhanced surveillance, as mandated by the European regulations underlying this framework (the so-called two-pack). But the end of the programme is also an opportunity for us to refocus our activities, as already indicated in the opinion we published in April 2018. Looking ahead, our work in Greece will now be focused on financial and macro-critical issues. More specifically, this includes financial sector stability, macroeconomic projections, headline fiscal targets, and sustainability and financial needs.  What do you see as the main priorities for the post-programme period? What are the areas that Greece should focus on in the years ahead so as to achieve sustainable growth? And what are the main risks?  In line with what I have just said, allow me to focus on the financial sector. Reducing NPLs is certainly top of the list from our point of view. On the one hand, only stronger and healthier banks can provide the necessary basis for an increase in the supply of credit that can support economic growth. On the other hand, the restructuring of private and tax debt that could accompany the reduction of NPLs is also expected to help healthy companies restart their activities and thus reinforce the demand for credit. A lot has been achieved under the programme. The legislative framework is in place, but continued implementation will be key. Improving the effectiveness of the judicial system is also essential to guarantee a well-functioning financial sector. We also still envisage improvements in banks’ governance frameworks, which will be essential to establish the conditions necessary to attract both domestic and foreign investors and allow the divestment of Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) holdings over time. In any case, it will be very important that the authorities refrain from trying to influence banks’ credit decisions and focus instead on improving the framework within which they operate.  Are Greek banks now safe in terms of their capital position? Will they manage to reach the NPL targets as agreed? Should the targets be tightened for the years after 2019?  The capital position of Greek banks has strengthened substantially during the programme and is now quantitatively at higher levels than in other countries affected by the crisis. However, the quality of Greek banks’ capital is lower than elsewhere in Europe, consisting partly of deferred tax assets, and there is still a large amount of non-performing exposures (NPE) as a legacy of the crisis. There is a need to be prudent and to set ambitious targets in order to significantly reduce the NPE ratio by the end of 2019. The performance of Greek banks has so far been broadly in line with their approved NPL targets, as shown in the Bank of Greece’s quarterly NPL monitoring reports. However, the targets to be achieved by the end of 2019 are back-loaded. Beyond 2019, continued efforts are needed to further reduce the NPE ratio in Greece in the years ahead, until it is closer to the euro area average. Swift progress in resolving NPLs is crucial not only for economic recovery, but also for the forward-looking capital adequacy of Greek banks. This depends on the economic environment stabilising and, importantly, on the continued and improved effectiveness of the relevant legal frameworks (household and corporate insolvency, out-of-court workout, NPL sales and e-auctions). For example, it will be easier to reduce the amount of NPLs if there is a reduction in the backlog of cases related to the household insolvency framework (the so-called Katseli law) that are still pending before the courts. In June the government presented an ambitious action plan that will be closely monitored in the context of the enhanced surveillance framework.  Are you satisfied with the pace of e-auctions?   A comprehensive approach involving all stakeholders must remain in place at all times to ensure that the e-auction system continues to be successful. We have seen a clear improvement here in recent months, but further progress in raising the number of auctions is needed, especially for properties located outside Attica. So we will continue to monitor the situation closely, in cooperation with the authorities. It is also important to recognise that e-auctions have incentivised borrowers (including strategic defaulters) and banks to work towards a mutually beneficial solution. There are indications of increased restructurings and settlements of loans now that e-auctions have started.  The ECB lifted the waiver for Greek government bonds. Wasn’t the enhanced surveillance sufficient to keep it? How much liquidity did banks have to get from ELA as a result of lifting the waiver?   The minimum credit rating rule for ECB collateral eligibility pre-dates the Greek crisis. In 2010, we acknowledged that the rule could be procyclical and granted a waiver to countries under an EU/IMF programme, because policy conditionality and access to comprehensive information gave us confidence about the sovereign’s creditworthiness. The framework has been applied unchanged to all countries since 2010. But enhanced surveillance is not a programme and does not entail conditionality – I assume this is exactly why the government accepted it! It therefore does not comply with our framework.  That being said, the lifting of the waiver was a “non-event” for banks, as one Greek bank CEO recently pointed out. Greek banks have broadened their market financing and successfully shifted parts of their financing from monetary policy operations onto the interbank repo market. The significant increase in deposits during the summer months helped as well. Overall, bank liquidity has been continuously improving. It is important that this trend is further supported in the period ahead.  Is the Greek debt sustainable according to the ECB? We were wondering, if you consider it sustainable, why you couldn’t have included the Greek bonds in the public sector purchase programme (PSPP – also known as QE) for at least a few weeks after the Eurogroup decision on debt measures, when the waiver was still in force. Are you going to publish the ECB’s debt sustainability analysis?  The agreement reached by the Eurogroup on 22 June was a significant step towards restoring debt sustainability, especially over the medium term (that is, until the end of the deferral period). In the long term, we welcome the Eurogroup’s readiness to consider further debt measures if there are adverse developments. Indeed, downside risks to both macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions remain sizeable. As for the PSPP, Greek government bonds lost their eligibility on 21 August when the programme ended. At that point, the Eurogroup’s debt measures had still not been ratified. In any case, purchases would have been very limited over such a short period.  Is there any chance that Greek bonds could be included at some point in the future in the reinvestment phase of the PSPP? How many years do you think the reinvestment of maturing securities will last?  Without a programme, Greek government bonds are now treated like any other bonds for the purpose of ECB eligibility. Once they regain investment grade status they could be included in all ECB programmes, subject to a Governing Council decision. As you know, we intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme (APP) for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.  The government seems to have put on hold, for the time being, plans to return to the markets. Do you think that Greece has now regained full access to international capital markets? Do you think it should wait until after the elections to go back to the markets?   Greece’s market access conditions have clearly improved compared with one year ago. Bond market liquidity has also improved after the swap operation conducted in November 2017, which contributed to the normalisation of the Greek government bond yield curve and also supported increased foreign participation in the bond market. Over the past few months, however, Greek bond yields have remained elevated and volatile, reacting to international and European stress, even after the approval of debt measures by the Eurogroup in June and the upgrade of Greece’s credit rating by the rating agencies. So we should be patient and prudent when assessing market access. Crucially, investor confidence will rely on the continued implementation of reforms and on avoiding backtracking on past improvements.  Are you concerned that a crisis, for example in Italy, could jeopardise Greece’s market access? Wouldn’t a precautionary credit line, as Mr Stournaras had suggested, have been useful in this respect?  Indeed, a precautionary credit line would have helped to cushion negative spillover effects from the international markets and to reinforce the credibility of the Greek sovereign as an issuer. It was therefore a less risky path from a purely financial standpoint. That being said, it would have entailed continued policy conditionality. I respect the government’s judgement that, after eight years under various programmes, it was time for Greece to regain ownership of its policies.  Is the ECB concerned about a hostile spirit often expressed by the government toward the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Mr Stournaras, and recently even indirectly towards the former Vice-President of the ECB, Mr Papademos?  We do not intervene in internal political discussions, whether in Greece or elsewhere. It is important that the independence of the Bank of Greece and its governor is preserved. Personally, I have the highest appreciation for Mr Papademos and Mr Stournaras as economists and policymakers. I must stress that an independent statistical system is also crucial. I won’t comment on Greek judicial decisions, but one should not underestimate the damage inflicted on Greece’s credibility by never-ending legal action against the former president of Elstat. Mr Georgiou discharged his duty in compliance with the European framework and his findings remain unchallenged today, including by the government.  Do you think that the planned pension cuts for 2019 should be suspended or postponed, as the government wants? Has the government made any concrete proposals ahead of the mission and in view of the 2019 draft budget? The government also plans tax cuts in 2019 using the expected excess primary surplus, affecting ENFIA and social security contributions, among others. Do you agree with these measures?  In line with what I said on the refocusing of our contribution to the programme, we do not want to discuss specific fiscal policy measures. What is essential for us is that fiscal targets for 2019 are met and that the budget composition is growth-friendly. As is the case in a number of countries in the euro area, it is important that the level of direct income taxation supports economic growth while ensuring that fiscal targets are met.   What about a reversal of labour market reforms (minimum wage, collective bargaining)? Do the institutions have to consent? And do you think the markets will react, interpreting it as a sign of backtracking?   Again, I don’t want to discuss specific measures.   When do you think capital controls should be fully removed?  The pace and composition of capital controls are in the hands of the Greek authorities. Many of the restrictions imposed in mid-2015 have already been lifted; the government published a roadmap for relaxing capital controls in May 2017, which it is closely following. This steady and responsible approach has been successful so far. Only once capital controls have been completely removed will the Greek economy and Greek banks be able to function normally inside the euro area. To achieve this, it is crucial to build an environment which strengthens depositors’ confidence and makes the Greek financial system resilient to outside stress.   "
2018-08-05,Sabine Lautenschläger,Interview with Welt am Sonntag,"Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Anja Ettel and Anne Kunz on 30 July 2018 and published on 5 August 2018","  Interview with Welt am Sonntag   Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Anja Ettel and Anne Kunz on 30 July 2018 and published on 5 August 2018  15 September marks the tenth anniversary of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers. You were then the chief banking supervisor at the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Do you remember that day?  Yes, I can remember it vividly. I was in the BaFin that weekend and participated in the crisis calls with the international supervisors. I saw at first hand how things came to a head that weekend. In the night from Sunday to Monday, the US colleagues decided not to rescue Lehman. Three of us were holding the fort at the BaFin that night.   Were you immediately aware of the magnitude of what was happening?   We knew that the collapse of such a bank would not leave the financial world unscathed. Nonetheless, we all underestimated the severity of the fallout. Nobody foresaw a crisis of confidence that would bring whole markets to a standstill.   Would Lehman still be possible today?   I would never say that there will never be another crisis. But there’s no doubt that institutions and supervisors are now better prepared. Banks hold much more capital and liquidity. Their risk management and corporate governance are better too, albeit not yet good enough at every institution.   One theory has it that the financial crisis would not have unfolded as it did if more women had been on the banks’ boards. Is there some truth in that?   I don’t know about that – but there is good reason to believe that mixed teams come up with better results. Unfortunately, women are still under-represented at board level.   Not in supervision though.  There have always been more women in supervision. But I would resist any attempt to attribute certain behaviours solely to gender. People at the top need to have qualities such as assertiveness and decisiveness – that goes for men and women. And that applies in supervision too.  For example?  As a supervisor I have to state unpleasant truths and take tough decisions; I have to fight my corner time and time again. And that leaves its mark. People are shaped by their profession.   How do you react to the criticism that supervision has become too strong – and is partly why European banks are so weak compared with their US peers.   Do you think that’s true?   The profitable US banks are in any case leaving European banks further behind.   I find that idea quite amusing. Conversely, it means that the weaker the supervision, the stronger the banks. The truth is that strict supervision leads to strong banks. Institutions become more resilient when supervisors require them to hold adequate capital to cover their risks and insist on sufficient liquidity and better risk management.   The US institutions received comprehensive state aid during the crisis. And now the United States is even rolling back regulation. Both of these represent a disadvantage for domestic banks.  Up to now, the US authorities have generally only revoked rules that went beyond international standards. But you do have a point. It’s important that large international institutions meet the same standards, particularly in trading. That is why we need to have the new Basel rules implemented in all major financial centres. Moreover, let’s not forget that the United States managed to quickly return to a growth path. That has of course been of great benefit to the US banking system too. We were much slower in that regard, also in tackling structural problems.   One outcome of the financial crisis was the ECB’s controversial asset purchase programme. The Governing Council has indeed decided to stop purchases, but only very slowly. Meanwhile German social security funds have been suffering enormously from the negative interest rates for a long time. Shouldn’t you be moving more quickly?   Ending the asset purchase programme is a major first step. But I agree that the side-effects of an extraordinarily loose monetary policy increase over time and I have pointed that out repeatedly. But after pursuing such an expansionary monetary policy, it would be wrong to now move abruptly in the other direction. That wouldn’t help either the economy or price stability.   But rather?  I am very much in favour of normalising monetary policy. That implies that we should gradually increase interest rates again. However, we can only do that if we are on a sustainable path towards price stability. Moreover, we should not forget that the social security funds would be in a much weaker financial position today if economic growth had been held back by very tight monetary policy and higher unemployment. And German savers too sometimes forget that they can only save if they have a job. The trick therefore is to move steadily towards the exit without disrupting growth.  Non-performing loans are another problem. There are in fact new rules for reducing them. Compared with the ECB’s earlier plans, the compromise appears very half-hearted.  Objection. The rules are definitely not half-hearted. Uniform expectations have been specified for future non-performing loans (NPLs) and each bank will receive clear and ambitious supervisory targets for the stock of existing NPLs. We need to bear in mind that the starting level of NPL stock differs across banks.   Nevertheless, a single currency area needs uniform rules.  That’s exactly what there is now. We have found a yardstick for all loans which become non-performing. And not only for newly arranged loans, but also for existing loans which will cease to be serviced in the future. I considered that to be very important because it prevents institutions from deferring too many loan loss provisions.   You don’t seem to be really satisfied with the outcome.  I think the concept is good. However, in some respects I would have liked to be somewhat more ambitious.  Have the plans failed because of Italy?   The agreement now reached is a decision taken by the ECB’s Supervisory Board, in which 25 supervisors find a common position. The outcome is a very good package, all in all.  Institutions with long transition periods could be treated leniently.  Don’t worry, we are tough. It’s not our job as supervisor to prevent banks from leaving the market. In other words, we aren’t here to ensure the survival of each bank. We are here to react promptly to risks. And also to recognise when a bank is indeed no longer viable and has to be resolved.  How can it be then that a bank such as Monte dei Paschi is still viable as far as the ECB is concerned?  I cannot talk about individual institutions. In principle of course, banks hit by a crisis should also be given a new chance to become viable through appropriate measures, such as a capital injection or a change in the business model.  Are national champions still important?  I would like to see more euro area champions.  Companies in Germany have good credit lines, but banks hardly earn anything from their lending activities.  Competition is indeed fierce. Too much competition can also bring disadvantages.  What can we do about that?   Supervisors have to work with the existing banking market. Consolidation is primarily a matter for the market. What’s more, customers need to realise that they have to pay for good services.   Listening to you, that all sounds great. Is there anything that keeps you awake at night?  I always sleep very well. That’s probably one of my strengths [laughs]. But to be serious, what I really do worry about is the threat of deregulation. Not only in the United States, but also in Europe.   Domestic banks haven’t noticed this yet.  That may be, but I see a clear movement in that direction in current proposals to change European legislation. Attitudes towards strong supervision are no longer so positive. After the financial crisis, politicians reinforced the supervisory function and gave it tools to pre-empt looming risks. Prior to that, supervisors were often unable to react until the damage had been done. We need to watch out for the pendulum swinging back.  Where do you see signs of that?  There are some proposals for the Capital Requirements Directive that I am concerned about. It may become more difficult for supervisors to require more capital for certain risks. This would weaken the supervisory tools.   Danièle Nouy’s term as Chair of ECB Banking Supervision finishes at the end of the year. Could you imagine taking her place?  I have a great passion for banking supervision, and it will be a turning point for me when I stop doing it. But I am convinced that job rotation is good, at all levels. It would be wrong to exclude the Chair and Vice-Chair from this. A fresh perspective is also important in banking supervision.   And for you personally?  My ECB Executive Board mandate will then still have three years to run. I will take on new tasks there in early 2019. I won’t get bored.  For example, what about heading the Bundesbank, a position which is likely to change next year?  I’m not giving that any thought at present.   "
2018-07-09,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Bloomberg TV,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Caroline Connan and broadcast on 9 July 2018","  Interview with Bloomberg TV   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Caroline Connan and broadcast on 9 July 2018  Donald Trump has pulled the trigger on tariffs on China; China is retaliating. Could that complicate the ECB’s task going forward?  What’s really important for us to gauge is the impact on business confidence, which so far has been limited. We see this escalation process: we start with skirmishes and then skirmishes may turn into clashes and then, at some point, clashes may turn into a fully-fledged war. That would be very bad for business confidence. So far, the backdrop is very strong growth in the Eurozone, resilient growth in the Eurozone, meaning that what we’ve seen so far doesn’t have the potential to derail the recovery.  Can the ECB just sit back and watch this trade war happening?  We are never sitting back and watching; we have to understand what’s going on. So far we believe that growth is strong enough to withstand the shock.  Have you already seen some companies holding back investments because of these protectionist policies risks?  Yes, that may happen. We are not complacent on the possible risks. A fully-fledged trade war would be extremely bad for the world economy – starting with the United States, by the way. The first victim would be American jobs, American workers. We very much hope that this doesn’t happen.  What could be the long-term impact?  The long-term impact is about how the world is run. It’s about having an open, free market economy globally, with the rule of law and with instruments for nations to talk together. That’s how we’ve worked since World War II and we’ve been very well served by the system. We want it to continue. It has to be improved; it has to become fairer, it has to deliver fairer outcomes for workers and for households, but it has to remain open. It has to remain built on trust between nations.  We’ve got this trade war going. We’ve got uncertainties around Brexit. We’ve got geopolitical risks, with new sanctions on Iran. What is the biggest risk you see throughout this summer?  To start with, we see risk as coming mainly from outside the Eurozone. Primarily that’s about trade tensions, as we’ve just discussed. That’s about escalation of trade tensions denting business confidence globally, and that’s the main risk.  Could the ECB have to rethink its path between supporting growth and fighting inflation because of these risks?  These risks were discussed when the Governing Council met in Riga last month. We discussed risks thoroughly and we designed a path of sustained monetary accommodation, anticipating that net asset purchases end in December 2018, but with a continued degree of monetary accommodation being delivered by rate guidance – enhanced guidance on rates – and by reinvestment policy. That is the balance we struck in Riga and it already took account of the risks.  Despite all these headwinds we’ve been discussing, the ECB still plans to exit QE by the end of this year. What could derail these plans?  That’s clearly what we anticipate. Now, that said, it will be data dependent – as with everything we do. But as we speak, in mid-July, I see no reason to change our expectations.  There has been some confusion among investors about the ECB keeping rates on hold until “at least through the summer of 2019”; can you explain to us again what this means?  “At least through the summer” means “at least through the summer”. It is date-based guidance, which so far we haven’t done, so it’s a step forward in enhancing our forward guidance. At the same time, it gives us enough flexibility to adjust depending on the data flow.  Does that mean we could see a decision on rates as soon as September 2019?  That’s not something I can comment on today, by definition; we did not discuss it in Riga.  Could this actually come before the summer of 2019? Could we see any change of policies before then, depending on the risk we are currently seeing?  The expectation is that rates will remain low, at the current level, at least through the summer of 2019.  The ECB wants to keep this guidance quite vague at the moment?  It’s not vague; it’s precise enough to anchor, to pin down money market rates. It has been, by the way, very effective. It has been well understood by the market, so I see no reason to change it while it works.  Mario Draghi, the ECB President, has flagged that the reinvestment of maturing bonds could be the next important policy step for the ECB. Will this become a way for the ECB to provide a little easing?  It is an important part of a package of measures that delivers monetary accommodation, sustained monetary accommodation beyond the end of net asset purchases, that is, after December 2018. There are two aspects: we have the enhanced rate guidance and we have the reinvestment policy. So it is clearly part of the package. It will ensure that the ECB keeps a very significant market presence beyond the end of the net asset purchases and for an extended period of time after the end of the asset purchases. That said, we haven’t discussed any details, so any details related to the maturity of our reinvestment, that’s a technical discussion. That’s not something the Governing Council or even our committees have discussed.  Is it going to be done before the end of this year?  We’ll certainly have to discuss it. I see it as a technical discussion; I don’t see it as a major aspect of our monetary policy when it comes to the maturities. But the commitment to reinvest is important because it will ensure a continued market presence, which is important to maintain the degree of monetary accommodation.  Could these reinvestments exceed €160 billion next year, could they be closer to €200 billion, for example?  The reinvestments are quite mechanical. They derive from past investment policy. As you know, we are committed to being very transparent. We are publishing the reinvestments 12 months in advance so you will have the numbers when they come.  There is some flexibility when it comes to reinvestments. Can the ECB and some national central banks reinvest a government bond into a corporate bond, or vice-versa?  That is not something we’ve discussed. That will be a technical discussion. What I don’t expect is any departure from the principle of capital key investment of government bonds, which has been a key principle at the heart of our public sector purchase programme.  There are reports about some kind of “operation twist” from the ECB about buying long-term bonds. Is this happening?  As I said, that’s not something we’ve discussed.  That’s something you’re planning to discuss? That’s something that’s on the table?  We will discuss the reinvestment policy; that will be a technical discussion. I don’t think it’s a major aspect of our monetary policy.  With Brexit it seems like we’ve had a major step; on Friday night, after 12 hours of discussions, Theresa May managed to get some kind of blueprint. Do you see this as good news or bad news?  The ECB is not part of the negotiations. The negotiations between the United Kingdom and Europe are led by Michel Barnier on the European side. So we certainly defer to Mr Barnier when it comes to the political direction of those negotiations. It is clearly very positive that the UK authorities are willing to engage in a constructive way, in a practical way, in a detailed way. It will be for Michel Barnier to react to the paper. That said, and beyond the positive news in terms of how the discussion is moving on, we also believe at the ECB that private players, industry, have a responsibility to prepare for the worst outcome. So hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.  In fact it seems like we have an agreement to have similar regulation in the industrial sector and the agricultural sector, but not the services sector. As we know, the financial services sector is what worries investors the most. Is this the big concern here?  I will defer to Michel Barnier to pass judgement on that. What we certainly believe very strongly – as does the European Commission and as do all Member States – is that the key principles which uphold the Single Market should not be harmed. Certainly, a good solution should be found with the United Kingdom, but that cannot be at the expense of the fundamental principles that have upheld the functioning of the Single Market.  Should the EU actually extend the deadline beyond March 2019 – if that’s a possibility – to have a better agreement?  That’s part of the political discussion; that’s not for us to decide.  Very finally, the Eurozone budget – which is an idea wanted by the French President, Emmanuel Macron – seems to face a lot of opposition. Do you think it’s a good idea? Is it necessary and what could overcome this opposition?  It is not an easy discussion. It’s a fundamentally political discussion that’s about sharing money, that’s about sharing sovereignty. It’s good the discussion has started. It’s good that ministers and leaders are discussing ways to make the Eurozone more resilient and to make the Eurozone stronger. Given the amount of uncertainty that we see around us in the world, all of us in Europe, in the Eurozone, have a duty to make our system stronger. It’s good that that the discussion has started, finally.  Even if it’s being delayed, even if it might not happen in this mandate of Emmanuel Macron?  No one expects that discussion to be easy, so there is lower-hanging fruit such as completing the banking union. We would certainly hope that the capital markets union would feature more prominently on the agenda and also that the rules, the fiscal rules and the macroeconomic rules we’ve been working with, can be improved, can be made more credible. Fiscal union is not low-hanging fruit; it is difficult, it will take time, but it’s good that that discussion has started.   "
2018-06-25,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Le Figaro,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Fabrice Nodé-Langlois and published on 25 June 2018","  Interview with Le Figaro   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Fabrice Nodé-Langlois and published on 25 June 2018  At the summit on Thursday France and Germany are to present their joint roadmap for European reform. At a time when many citizens are calling Europe into question, why should it be reinforced?  We are living in a confusing, dangerous world which is evolving very fast and not always in the right direction. Europe is once again in rough waters and it is its duty to protect its citizens. If a boat is caught in a storm, the crew needs to cooperate closely, not work at cross purposes. Europe will not be able to establish a joint defence capability or improve border control unless it has a robust economy. That is why we urgently need to strengthen the euro area. We cannot afford to have another ten years of crisis. Existential discussions on the single currency are a waste of time. Surveys show that the vast majority of European citizens are in favour of the euro.  Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel propose creating a budget for the euro area. What is that budget for?  The Meseberg agreement is an important contribution to the reform of the euro area. The euro area budget is a useful idea. In the first instance, the common budget can help to accelerate convergence among Member States. At the time of the Maastricht Treaty, it was somewhat naively thought, in France especially, that Monetary Union was going to bring about convergence by and of itself. That was not the case. With time, it could help a country hit by a recession that it could not tackle alone, even if its public finances were in order. Look at Ireland, which in 2008 was hit by a severe financial crisis, followed by a recession, despite having a sound budget. It was not able to manage on its own. The budget is also a political symbol for the shared interest of euro area countries. The euro area should be about more than individual interests in a currency managed by the ECB.  How can this convergence be improved in practice?  We can invest in infrastructure or in facilitating reforms that strengthen the euro area. I am thinking for example of the Greek land registry, which is still not in place and which could have been financed by this budgetary capacity if it had existed.  The roadmap does not mention any figure for this budget. Do you find that disappointing?  Let’s wait to see the amount, which can build up over several years. The budget should be large enough to deal with an economic shock in a euro area country.   What do you see as the priorities for improving the euro area?  First, we need to strengthen the single market, complete the banking union and the capital markets union. These are very technical projects but they can boost growth and stimulate investment and innovation.  Next, the euro area countries should be able to absorb shocks without things going badly wrong, as happened in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus. How do we get to that point? In France people still think the solution lies in new taxes or in more European spending. There may well be a place for such measures, as discussed, but the first line of defence is that each country should make its economy more resistant and restore the fiscal room to manoeuvre that has now disappeared. Yet we have to admit that our budgetary rules have not attained their objective. At present, virtually the only country with fiscal buffer is Germany. France needs to keep reducing its deficit to below 3% of GDP in order to restore its resilience to shocks.  And what else is needed?  The ECB needs a well-functioning political framework, which requires coordination and trust between the member countries. One has to rebuild this trust, which has been damaged by ten years of crisis. It is of vital importance to the ECB that the different countries have a shared vision of their future and are able to work together. It’s not up to us to steer euro area politics.   What about the euro area Minister of Finance? The Franco-German roadmap doesn’t mention this at all…  Let’s not put the cart before the horse. A euro area Finance Minister would imply the existence of a common political area, which I think is essential, but we aren’t there yet. The starting point is the Eurogroup, with its toolbox, including the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the European rescue fund. Germany and France are proposing to strengthen it by enabling it to intervene fast in the event of a banking crisis or to help a state before it’s too late, and that’s a good thing. By the way, at the ECB we don’t much like the term “European Monetary Fund”, which creates confusion both with the IMF, a very different institution, and the ECB.  “Fast”? So you mean without necessarily waiting for a vote in the German Bundestag to save, for example, an Italian bank?  In fact, it’s vital for the euro area to be able to take decisions fast. The ECB can do this. The 25 members of our Governing Council may have their differences, but we analyse, we debate, we try to build a consensus and, finally, we take a decision on which nobody has a veto. By contrast, the crisis management system in the euro area is essentially intergovernmental. This method carries a high economic cost because it’s a procrastination machine. Look at the Greek crisis, which is finally coming to an end after eight years! And it turns every decision into a zero-sum game. The challenge for the European Council, at the end of this week, will be to move from a Europe of horse-trading to a Europe that builds its own future. Europe has to show that it is taking its destiny into its own hands.   Last Thursday you took part in the Eurogroup meeting on Greece. Are you satisfied with the agreement? Will the debt relief granted be enough?  This is a turning point for Greece and for Europe. Greece can now free itself from European stewardship. The sacrifices made by Greek society, supported by European solidarity, have paid off. For those who have doubts about this solidarity, I would like to point out that Europe provided Greece with funding of €245 billion! I particularly admire the determination and courage of the Greek Finance Minister, Euclid Tsakalotos. Greece will also get a clear boost from the debt relief that was promised a long time ago by the European governments. The ECB was clearly in favour of this. The measures decided upon by the Eurogroup go in the right direction, because in the medium term they will make Greece’s debt more sustainable and in the long term the ministers declared their willingness to take additional measures should the need arise. But let’s not be naive: Greece will move from a dialogue with the European institutions and the IMF to a dialogue with the financial markets, which will be neither easier nor more pleasant. To maximise its chances, the country must continue with its reforms and stick to a prudent budgetary policy.  Greece failed to leave the euro area in 2015 and has been through a deep recession. If you could go back in time, would you support Greece in a different way?  If we want to take a long, hard look at ourselves, we should go back further than the Greek crisis, to the beginnings of the euro area. Between 1999 and 2010, we allowed budgetary situations and wage costs to diverge between countries, which led to the crisis. That was the first lesson. Faced with the crisis, we had to support Greece – it was a question of solidarity. We also had to involve the IMF which, unlike Europe, had experience in supporting countries through crises. And it was essential to reduce public expenditure, because Greece was clearly living beyond its means. The mistake, from my point of view, was in reducing it too drastically, which made the recession worse. We should have been more realistic about the sustainability of Greece’s debt and insisted on competitiveness and combatting rent-seeking from the start, instead of leaving taxpayers and workers to foot the bill for the adjustment. I might add that Europe lacks a budgetary instrument to support social adjustment in crisis countries, which could have prevented dramatic situations – schools without heating and hospitals without medicine – such as we saw in Greece.  On 14 June the ECB announced, as expected, the end of its policy of asset purchases, referred to as quantitative easing or QE. In contrast, the first rise in interest rates is going to come later than expected. Does that reflect your concerns about the robustness of growth?  Growth is still robust throughout the euro area, despite the moderation in the first quarter, and even in the second quarter in certain countries. But there is increasing uncertainty arising from tensions in world trade as well as the risk of volatility in the financial markets and in certain emerging economies, and we have to take all that into account. Hence the unanimous decision by the Governing Council: on the one hand, due to the robust growth we are confident that inflation will return to close to 2% and we anticipate our net asset purchase programme to end in December; on the other hand, we recognise the need to maintain a very accommodative monetary policy. We expect our policy rates to remain unchanged until at least through the summer of 2019. and we will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities in our portfolio, or around €15 billion per month, in 2019.  That’s what surprised most observers, and the markets…  Yes, for the first time, we are communicating about future policy rates with a date, even if it’s still only indicative. In our jargon, we call this “enhanced forward guidance”. Now that we have decided to end the net asset purchases, this enhanced guidance is necessary to anchor expectations.  In the end, what will these three years of QE have achieved?   Don’t forget that these measures were decided on in autumn 2014, in the face of a slowdown in growth and a heightened risk of deflation. We needed to react very strongly. QE has considerably improved the financing conditions of households and firms, restarted growth and eliminated the risk of deflation. A Spanish SME can now borrow at the same interest rate as a German SME.  QE has been criticised for benefiting those most well off…  I disagree. First, our monetary policy has helped the millions of unemployed who lost their job during the recession. The unemployment rate in the euro area is falling steadily, to a large extent thanks to monetary policy.    "
2018-06-23,Peter Praet,Interview with Expresso,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 18 June 2018 and published on 23 June 2018","  Interview with Expresso   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by João Silvestre on 18 June 2018 and published on 23 June 2018  Is the asset purchase programme (APP) really going to conclude at the end of this year?  What we did last week was to express an anticipation that net asset purchases would end at the end of the year. We didn't say we were now deciding to stop the programme in December. We still have six months to go. We translated the increased confidence we expressed about developments in the economy and inflation into an anticipation about the APP. And, at the same time, we also enhanced the forward guidance on interest rates. But, in any event, to anticipate the end of the programme is to give a strong signal.   What exactly do you mean by giving a strong signal?  We undertook a careful review of the progress made towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. It was a strong signal because, in spite of a recent moderation in euro area economic growth, we concluded that progress towards our aim has been substantial so far, and actually sufficiently substantial for us to be in a position to express this anticipation of an end to net asset purchases at the end of the year. We think that the underlying strength of the economy gives grounds that inflation convergence will continue in the period ahead, even after a gradual winding down of net asset purchases.  What is that confidence based on?  There is a path of gradual improvement towards our inflation aim, as the euro area economy will continue to grow above potential. Increasing pressure on the utilisation of resources, notably in the labour market, will continue to support inflation over the medium term.  Is the ECB comfortable with the recent projection pointing to annual inflation of 1.7% over the period to 2020, clearly below the 2% aim for these three years?  The Eurosystem staff projections are only one element of our assessment. What is crucial is that we see a sustained path of adjustment of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. Over the projection period, the contribution of energy to inflation declines, and inflation excluding energy and food gradually rises, as capacity constraints become increasingly binding.   What the ECB anticipated last week was the halving of asset purchases between October and December. But there was a proviso: the measure was subject to data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook. What does this mean in practice?  Our baseline scenario is that the euro area expansion will continue in the period ahead. But new uncertainties have arisen in 2018. Last year was exceptional, with euro area GDP growing by about 3% in real terms between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, with the combination of strong growth in domestic demand and a rebound in international trade. This year, international trade dynamics seem weaker. It may be attributable to a delayed impact of the appreciation of the euro since the beginning of 2017. Temporary factors and supply-side tensions related to very high levels of capacity utilisation in some euro area countries also contributed to a moderation in economic growth in early 2018. In a nutshell, both demand and supply-side factors are at work, and our baseline scenario is surrounded by more uncertainty. So we must be prudent and carefully monitor economic developments.  Why?  The level of uncertainty has increased. Protectionism, for example, is having an effect on business sentiment, which might already be holding back investment. It is still too early to tell. In addition, Brexit will have financial implications for firms not only in the United Kingdom, but at this stage no one knows what the final Brexit conditions will be.   Are these uncertainties the reason for your prudence in the way the asset purchase programme is being concluded?  Our baseline scenario still holds, but we must monitor the risks. This is why we decided to express an anticipation about the evolution of our net asset purchases. By doing so we are keeping what we call optionality.   Ultimately, if risks materialise, could one of the options be a further extension of the programme into 2019?  As our President, Mario Draghi, said last week, the asset purchase programme is now an integral part of our ""toolbox"". It is definitely an option, but, last week, we announced our anticipation of the end of net asset purchases, which reflects our confidence that inflation is on course to reach levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.   Well, are you being vigilant?  We are alert to the tail risks that may, for example, stem from protectionism and, potentially, from an associated sharp fall in confidence.   Might another option be to increase the monthly pace of purchases for the last three months of the year, to purchase more than €15 billion, if the situation deteriorates?  The asset purchase programme remains an integral part of our ""toolbox"". This being said, our monetary policy decisions altogether maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that is still needed for inflation to converge towards our aim. This includes, first, our enhanced forward guidance on interest rates, which we expect will remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary, and, second, our very large stock of assets for which we intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities. The reinvestment policy plays a very important role, as the amounts are sizeable.  How long will the reinvestments last?  We intend to maintain our policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Our policy of reinvesting is another instrument at our disposal.  Regarding a change in interest rates, the ECB guaranteed that it will not take place until ""through the summer of 2019"". Does it mean until the end of next summer?  At our last Governing Council meeting we said that we expect our key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019. In any case, they will stay at their present levels for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.  Our enhanced forward guidance signals that we will remain patient in determining the timing of the first rate rise. The path of very short-term interest rates that is implicit in the term structure of money market interest rates is compatible with our intention of being patient.  Negative interest rates are one of the most controversial points within the ECB's current monetary policy framework. Particularly for the banks. What do you have to say to them?  You have to look at the whole package of measures that we have implemented. Consider, for example, the lines of funding aimed at bank lending to the real economy, known by the acronym TLTROs. They supported bank lending to the real economy. Banks that borrowed from the ECB and lent to the economy more than a pre-specified lending benchmark also benefited from a negative interest rate on their funding.   What role did the negative interest rates play?  They were important for enhancing the asset purchase programme and for forward guidance. They are an essential instrument in our toolbox that supports very favourable financial conditions, and therefore the economy. This led to improvements in the credit portfolio of banks. It also stimulated the demand for loans of households and firms.   Was the impact on savers one of the reasons for the negative reaction?  For those savers that do not want to take risks and therefore keep their assets in savings accounts, it is an issue. But it is important to look at the overall situation, and to take into account the impact of our measures on growth and jobs. Young people who need to borrow have benefited and, in general, the important thing for them is to find jobs. Our measures have supported economic activity and job creation.  Has the policy of monetary tightening of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) put pressure on the decisions of the ECB?  There is no pressure. We are in a different situation. The Fed and the ECB are at two different stages of their monetary policy cycles. PORTUGAL  Could the ending of this zero interest rate environment be a problem for more indebted countries, like Portugal?  Obviously, countries with higher debt levels have benefited more from lower refinancing costs, but this is not the objective of our monetary policy, which to ensure price stability. More fundamentally, we should always keep in mind that investor confidence in the sustainability of public finances is the key determinant of interest rates on sovereign debt. If there are doubts about the sustainability of public finances, spreads can increase to very high levels, despite the ECB's asset purchase programme.  I have noted that, following heightened market volatility due to developments in Italy, spillovers to interest rates on Portuguese public debt were contained, thanks to significant progress in public finances. This again stresses the importance of sound public finances.  What is your assessment of Portugal's progress?  Commission and ECB staff concluded their eighth post-programme surveillance mission last week. They stress that the current favourable macroeconomic and financial conditions provide an opportunity to accelerate structural reforms, further reduce macroeconomic imbalances and increase Portugal’s resilience to shocks. Fiscal consolidation remains necessary to ensure a steady decline in the debt ratio.  They also note that, while Portuguese banks have made considerable progress in strengthening their balance sheets, remaining vulnerabilities in the banking sector need to be addressed, in particular the high level of non-performing loans (13.7% in 2017 compared with an EU average of about 5%). Finally, addressing impediments to investment, increasing productivity and further improving the business environment remain key for strengthening potential growth. To conclude, my assessment is that significant progress has been made, but that ensuring prosperity on a lasting basis requires continuing the implementation of an ambitious reform agenda going forward. BANKING It is essential to complete the banking union. In this respect, the European summit on 28 and 29 June is very important. The European banking landscape is still characterised by one important feature: a strong exposure of banks to their national economy, including a high exposure to domestic public debt. The completion of the banking union will, over time, lead to a lower exposure to national economies. Regarding the situation of the banking sector, there is still a sizeable legacy of non-performing loans in some banks. An impressive effort has been made to reduce the level, but the situation has not yet been fully rectified. The banks are now much more capitalised. Their liquidity is much stronger. But, on the other hand, we have to be clear: for the large banks, the new regime under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive – BRRD, to use its English acronym – has still not been tested in the event of a crisis – luckily. The banks still have a strong national orientation: they have exposures to the public debt of their country and a strong focus on the domestic economy. If the national economy goes into recession, if budget deficits soar and public debt rises, this has immediate repercussions for the banks. European banking is not yet sufficiently diversified geographically. More consolidation, more cross-border holdings between banks from different countries, is needed. There is a need for more geographical diversification within the European Union. Smaller, local banks are also necessary to provide financial services to households and firms in a diversified banking landscape. ITALY We have seen very large market movements, following political declarations that unsettled market confidence. After political campaigns, it is normal that more precise government programmes are set out, and we now have to wait for more information about the fiscal plans of the new government.   "
2018-06-15,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Europe 1,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Cohen on 15 June 2018 and broadcast on 15 June 2018","  Interview with Europe 1   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Patrick Cohen on 15 June 2018 and broadcast on 15 June 2018  For three years the ECB has been purchasing huge amounts of public and private debt. Almost €2.5 trillion has been injected into the euro area economy. Yesterday, the ECB announced that all this would come to a stop at the end of the year. Does that mean the crisis is over?  Indeed, we plan to stop these purchases after December. Why? For two reasons. First, Europe is seeing strong growth. At the beginning of the year this growth slowed a little, but we feel that it remains robust and will bounce back and continue. And second, inflation is returning towards 2%, which is the ultimate goal of everything we do.  But the policy was working, and now you’re stopping it?   We’re stopping it precisely because it has worked. But it’s the asset purchases that we’re stopping. €2.5 trillion is not an insignificant amount, and our asset purchases have been very effective. However, we’re going to keep interest rates very low, at their current levels, in other words close to zero, at least through the summer of 2019. So we’ll be sticking with a monetary policy that will support the economy for a very long time.  You haven’t raised interest rates since 2011, and they remain very low. So they won’t rise before the summer of 2019 at the earliest?  Something else could happen, but we don’t anticipate raising rates before the summer of 2019, as you say, because the economy still needs some support.  But if growth picks up, could interest rates for individuals and businesses increase?  Long-term interest rates for individuals and businesses are naturally increasing because global growth is picking up and because US interest rates are rising. So yes, people have to be prepared. And, inevitably, government borrowing rates will also increase, and so governments will also have to be prepared.  You say that people will inevitably have to be prepared. Does that include our personal loans, our mortgages, for example?  Yes, but as I said, not right away – short-term rates will remain very low, close to zero, for a very long time, and at least until the middle of 2019.  Yesterday the Banque de France revised its 2018 growth forecast downwards, from 1.9% to 1.8%. But it still says growth is robust. Is that your assessment too, Mr Cœuré?  Yes, that’s our assessment. We talked about it yesterday in our meeting in Riga, which the Governor of the Banque de France was attending. We have all made the same assessment – the economy went through a short soft patch in the first quarter of 2018, because growth had been very strong at the end of 2017. Exports and global trade, in particular, were extremely buoyant in 2017. But now that is settling down and stabilising. Clearly, global factors are causing some uncertainty – there is the risk of a trade war, for example. But the US economy is still very strong and is being supported by a budgetary stimulus, and the euro area’s internal dynamics are also very robust. So we are not unduly worried.  On the risk of a trade war, and the US President’s decision to impose tariffs – what impact could they have?  This isn’t part of our economic projections, because we still don’t know exactly how all this will develop. For now, the impact is fairly limited because the tariffs mainly affect steel and aluminium. Clearly, if this were to degenerate into a full-blown trade war it could have a far more concerning impact. And then there is the long-term impact – the way the global economy works needs to be reviewed, and Europe may find itself a little alone on the world stage. We are more concerned about the historical consequences over the long term than we are about the short-term impacts.  But we’ve heard two different interpretations. The first is that this ultimately affects quite small amounts of the transatlantic trade between Europe and the United States. The second is that there’s been a loss of trust, in a way, and that this free trade area, which has allowed us to grow trade for years, is going to be disrupted or shut down, or at any rate may be damaged by the decisions of the United States. What do you think?  When it comes to trade, this loss of trust is a fact, unfortunately. It’s not about the United States itself, but the current US administration. What I can conclude from this as a European official is that Europe will have to rely on its own strengths: Europe must get organised, build up and leverage its economic and strategic power. Besides, there is an expectation here: the world is watching Europe. On climate change, for example, only Europe can achieve what was decided in the Paris Agreement.  And Donald Trump himself: is he a factor in economic development? And growth? He’s constantly taking credit for the strength of the US economy.  In the short term, yes, because he is going to reduce taxes on US firms – that will create growth in the United States. In the long term, it’s a different story.  Speaking of risks, Mr Cœuré, I imagine you have looked closely at the economic programme of the new Italian Government, which would necessarily lead to an increase in its deficit and debt. What do you have to say about that in Frankfurt?  First of all, we respect democracy. So we don’t lecture newly elected governments.  You’re not saying “the markets will teach the Italians to vote for the right thing”, as one European Commissioner put it?  For example. We will see what the Italian Government proposes. Basically, in the end, when you look at the situation the Italian economy is in, the challenges facing Italy are pretty straightforward. Its public debt is at a very high level.  €2.4 trillion.  Exactly. And its productivity, its productivity growth – so its potential, structural growth – is very weak compared with that of other large European countries. Those two challenges have nothing to do with the euro, or even Europe. We will see what the Italian Government puts forward as a solution. But they are aware of these challenges: the new Minister of Finance, Mr Tria, spoke about this the day before yesterday.  But how will you respond if their deficit exceeds 5% of GDP, or even reaches 7%, as some forecasts suggest? Will you intervene? It’s not necessarily up to you, but it’s instability that...  It’s up to the Commission and the governments to ensure compliance with the budgetary rules. It’s true that in Frankfurt we consider these rules important, because the euro is a community, we are in this together. It’s like shared ownership, so we start by respecting the rules.  Yesterday Mario Draghi, the President of the ECB, felt the need to mention that the euro is “irreversible” when talking about Italy. Why did he say that? Why did he emphasise that?  Because he was asked about it. It was a press conference, so he was answering questions. But it’s true, we don’t think there’s any point in discussing the future of the euro or the future of any particular country in the euro area. The euro is a political project and every time the European Heads of State have faced the question of whether a country should stay in the euro, they have always answered that the euro should remain as it is. And the people of Europe support the euro. More than 70% of Europeans are in favour of the euro.  Benoît Cœuré, you are French. Mario Draghi has to leave his position next autumn. Are you a candidate to replace him?  That question isn’t at all relevant at the moment.  Are you interested in the job?  It’s for October 2019 and it will be decided a priori at the European Council meeting in June 2019.  Are you interested in the job?  It’s not something I’m concerning myself with at all at the moment.  So, you’re not interested?   I have a full-time job. That’s not the kind of question I ask myself, given that it’s scheduled for October 2019.  If you were to be offered the position, would you accept?  Let’s come back to that again in six months, or a year.   "
2018-05-29,Vítor Constâncio,Interview with Spiegel Online,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Stefan Kaiser and Henning Jauernig on 22 May 2018 and published on 29 May 2018","  Interview with Spiegel Online   Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Stefan Kaiser and Henning Jauernig on 22 May 2018 and published on 29 May 2018  Mr Constâncio, you’ve worked at the European Central Bank for 18 years. Was there ever a moment when you thought that maybe the euro wasn’t such a good idea after all?  No. There were times at the height of the crisis when there were existential doubts about how things would turn out. But I was never in any doubt that Monetary Union was the right thing for European countries.   But there were some very severe crises. In 2012, for example, when the risk premia for Spanish and Italian government bonds rose dramatically and there was a risk that the euro area might break apart. Or in 2015, when Greece was close to bankruptcy. Didn’t that demonstrate that the euro area doesn’t work well?  The problems were a consequence of the way the euro area was set up to start with, which was very minimalistic. At the time, it was felt that all we needed was a single currency, a central bank and a fiscal brake. But events have shown that that wasn’t enough. For example, a crisis mechanism was not envisaged and there was no banking supervision at the European level. A number of important decisions have been taken in the meantime, for instance on the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism. The euro area has started to fix itself – and we’re still in the middle of that process.  Have the countries in the south of the euro area done enough on their side to fix Monetary Union?  Yes. The countries hardest hit by the crisis had high budget deficits and high current account deficits at the start of the crisis. So they were importing a lot more than they were exporting. But a great deal has been done since then. In the meantime, all the countries concerned have a primary fiscal surplus, which means that they are reducing their debt bit by bit. And all these countries now have a current account surplus; they are exporting more than they import. That is quite a turnaround.   These achievements are now hanging in the balance because one country may no longer want to do its part. Even if their attempt to form a government has failed for now, Italy’s dominant parties are Eurosceptics who want to make massive tax cuts and spend lots of money, despite that fact that, at 132% of gross domestic product, Italy has one of the highest levels of sovereign debt in the world.   It is certainly a challenge, first and foremost for Italy itself. When financial markets attacked Italy in 2012, it demonstrated that perceptions in the financial markets can be volatile and the risk assessment of a given debtor can change abruptly, sometimes with severe consequences – and this even though Italy already had a primary surplus at the time. We will have to see what happens now.   Risk premia for Italian government bonds have risen sharply again recently. At what point would the ECB intervene again, as it did in 2012?  I would like to stress that every intervention has to contribute to the fulfilment of our mandate and is also subject to conditionality. The Outright Monetary Transactions programme for intervening in national sovereign bond markets of vulnerable countries can only be used if the country in question also agrees to an adjustment programme. The rules are very clear on this. Everyone should remember that.   So if Italy wants to circumvent the EU’s fiscal rules, it can’t necessarily count on the ECB’s help?  I will only say that Italy knows the rules. They should perhaps take another close look at them.   Aren’t we again seeing the conflict at the core of the euro area? On the one hand, you have the stability-oriented northern countries like Germany, and on the other, you have the south. You have followed this debate for so many years now. Can you explain why there is such a fundamental disparity between countries in terms of financial culture?  There are certainly cultural differences that are rooted in history and are still in evidence. Some countries are against credit and high levels of debt, while others are less concerned. It is striking, for instance, that Germany has the lowest rate of property ownership in Europe. Why is that? In other countries people take out loans to build houses – especially now, with interest rates so low. In Germany, you barely see that happening. So, there are big cultural differences in certain respects, but reality has shown that compromises have to be made. And they have happened.  Would it have been easier to resolve the crisis if the German approach had not been so dominant?  Yes, I think so. Germany is a very successful country, and its success is built on a strong set of rules and respect for those rules. And things have gone very well for Germany since the Second World War. But this strict approach also has a weakness in times of crisis, particularly when a fast and flexible reaction is required. The reaction to the financial and sovereign debt crisis could have been quicker, and more flexible. That is my personal view. We have learned from the crisis and are in the process of fixing Monetary Union. But a few more steps still need to be taken. Most of all, we need much closer coordination of fiscal policy – and a stabilisation fund that can absorb sudden significant shocks. And the banking union is not yet complete.  French President Emmanuel Macron wants to eliminate those very shortcomings and thereby change the fundamental features of the euro area. His plans include a common European budget, a European finance minister and a common deposit insurance scheme for European banks. Can you understand that the German government is resisting many of these plans? I think one of the reasons for hesitation on the part of many European governments is that the euro area is currently going through a phase of very robust economic growth. When times are good, it’s always difficult to undertake reforms, because there doesn’t seem to be any need. In the past, significant EU reforms were always decided on at the height of a crisis. But that also makes them more expensive.   Will it take another euro crisis before we have a banking union?  You’d think that the banking union would be the easiest of these reforms. What we need most of all here is to introduce a common European deposit insurance scheme, so that the savings of bank customers are protected at the European level if a bank fails. That would further strengthen confidence in the euro, because our money essentially consists of bank deposits.   Right now, Germany is balking at the idea of this kind of mutualisation – not least because many Italian banks are still harbouring masses of bad loans on their balance sheets. Nobody in this country wants to be liable for that. How can this problem be solved?  It’s already being solved. We have started to considerably reduce levels of what are known as non-performing loans in the euro area – by more than €300 billion since 2014. This reduction has come about as a result of the pressure exerted by ECB Banking Supervision. And that pressure will remain strong.   There’s another point on which Germany stands more or less alone against most other euro area countries, and that’s interest rates. German savers are waiting to receive interest again on the money they have in the bank.  I understand their concern. But German savers didn’t exactly have it better in the past. They might have got 2.25% interest on their deposits before the euro was introduced, but inflation was also much higher back then, at 2.4%. So what we call the real interest rate was negative then too.  Savers’ money was eroded.  But then there is the other side of the coin. Low interest rates help public and private borrowers. People in Germany are not making use of that. As I said before, the rate of home ownership is pretty low – and has even declined in recent years.  That’s probably mainly to do with the steep rise in property prices.  Yes, but only in cities, not everywhere. Germans could use the low lending rates to their own advantage. That would mean borrowing somewhat more, but many people just don’t want to do that. They could have taken much greater advantage of the situation.  Does that also apply to savers and investors?  Yes, people in Germany leave too much money in their account instead of investing it in other, higher-yielding assets.   All the same, can you give German savers reason to hope that interest rates will finally start to rise again in 2019?  The Governing Council of the ECB decided that the Eurosystem will continue to purchase assets at a rate of €30 billion each month until the end of September, and that interest rates should remain at their current levels beyond the end of the purchase programme. Market participants currently expect interest rates to change around the middle of next year.   As a result of the ultra-loose monetary policy of central banks, stock market prices are rising for the ninth year in a row. Can this end without a crash?  There will not necessarily be a crash. But history shows that stock markets cannot go up forever. The economy will go into a recession again at some point, and then there will also be a correction in the stock markets. Nobody knows how big that correction will be. But no one is expecting a major crisis – unless there is a huge geopolitical crisis. That would be a different situation.  The looming trade war could also be a risk for the markets. The import tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump on European products such as aluminium and steel are due to come into effect on 1 June, and Trump is already threatening further tariffs on car imports. What impact would a trade war have on the economy?  That would step up tensions and it would be bad for the entire world. Not just for us, but for the United States too. But the import tariffs concretely announced on steel and aluminium are announced so far are very limited. Products affected amount to just 2% of US imports. The problem is that if the conflict evolves as it did between the two world wars, for instance, it could have fatal consequences for the global economy.  Do you think that it will come to that?  I don’t think that anyone wants a real trade war, because everyone knows that we would all stand to lose.   "
2018-05-23,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Die Zeit,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Lisa Nienhaus and Mark Schieritz on 16 May 2018 and published on 23 May 2018","  Interview with Die Zeit   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Lisa Nienhaus and Mark Schieritz on 16 May 2018 and published on 23 May 2018  Mr Cœuré, we need to talk about Italy, where two populist parties are currently trying to form a coalition. In a draft paper they demanded debt relief of €250 billion from the European Central Bank. They have since withdrawn that demand, but it’s still a shock, isn’t it?   The political discussion is still ongoing in Italy. The ECB will assess the new government’s plans when they are made public.   So, to make the question more general: can the ECB relieve a euro area country from the debts owed to it by that country?   No, it cannot. European treaties prohibit any such debt relief. Central banks cannot finance governments.   The coalition agreement includes tax cuts and spending increases that add up to more than €100 billion according to estimates. Italy is already a heavily indebted country. Are you concerned?   Again, it’s too early to comment on plans we don’t know. On fiscal policy in general, the ECB’s view is well known: Europe has fiscal rules and they should be respected. This is a matter of trust in our common currency.  The ECB’s large-scale purchases of government bonds are highly controversial, especially in Germany. Many of your critics now feel vindicated. Wouldn’t it be true to say that if you were not buying those bonds, then nobody would be able to call for debt relief?   It’s not that simple. The purchase of government bonds is within our mandate. It proved decisive in enabling the euro area economy to overcome the crisis and in restoring growth and price stability in Europe. That is why I will always defend our actions. And we designed the asset purchase programme in such a way that it is not in breach of the treaties.   How did you do that?   For example, we set a strict limit on how much we buy, so as to safeguard the functioning of the bond market. Moreover, the purchases are mainly made by the national central banks, which buy their national government bonds at their own risk: the Bundesbank buys German government bonds, the Banca d’Italia buys Italian government bonds, and so forth. They would have to bear the bulk of the losses if a government could not service its debt. I have always supported this arrangement because it ensures that the ECB does not introduce a fiscal union through the backdoor.   That means that if the Italians failed to repay their debt they would in the first instance harm themselves. The Italian central bank would then bear the heaviest losses.   I can’t comment on hypothetical scenarios.  The euro area Heads of State or Government want to launch a reform of Monetary Union in June. As you said yourself, the economy is growing, the crisis is over. Why the need for yet more reforms?   Indeed, the euro area expansion is strong and broad based. But as Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, often says [quoting JF Kennedy]: the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining. Europe has been made more stable over the past few years, but we are not there yet and now is the right time to complete the job.   Have you honestly ever met a politician that fixed the roof when the sun was shining? Most only start repairing it when it’s raining.   That is understandable, but if you’re right, it means that when the next crisis occurs European leaders will once again have to improvise a wobbly solution during a hectic late-night meeting in Brussels. I don’t think that’s how citizens expect Europe to be governed.   But isn’t that precisely how Europe has always been governed?   It was at the height of the debt crisis, because the situation at the time was unprecedented. The problem with late-night meetings is that, while we can get things done and indeed succeeded in doing so then, this type of improvised decision-making sows the seeds of mistrust – between governments, between citizens and politicians. It is not a tenable situation. Europe needs stable rules and institutions.   In this connection, the ECB has called for a European deposit insurance scheme. So German banks would have to pay towards reimbursing savers in Italy and Spain if banks in those countries failed. How would that make Europe more resilient to crises?   Let me put this discussion in perspective. We need three lines of defence for our Monetary Union. The first is to have well-functioning private markets, which are not yet fully in place. The Single Market needs to be completed, particularly in the services sector. Capital markets are also still too domestic. The second line of defence is to have sound fiscal policies in the Member States. Most countries have now reduced their deficit, but that is mainly thanks to favourable cyclical conditions. Fiscal improvement should be made structural, otherwise governments won’t have fiscal space when the next recession hits. Euro area-wide protection mechanisms such as the European Stability Mechanism, the Single Resolution Fund for banks, or a new deposit insurance scheme are only the third line of defence. All existing currency unions have such or similar mechanisms to safeguard the stability of their currency.  What exactly does deposit insurance protect us against?   For one, it can enhance confidence in the banking system by preventing savers from emptying their bank accounts in a crisis situation. History has taught us that such bank runs are highly dangerous.  That all sounds fine, but Germany has a different perspective: a common deposit insurance scheme means that Germans would also be affected if, say, a bank in Italy failed. To return to the metaphor: if it rains, the roof would be in a worse state after the repair than before. Why should we agree to that?   With a proper European deposit insurance scheme, Germans would have fewer problems rather than more. A deposit insurance scheme should be seen as an insurance against economic risks, just as you take out liability insurance to protect yourself against the risk of an accident. If risks are properly priced, it's not a system of transfers between countries and still less from the “North” to the “South”, as is too often argued.  Of course, banks would need to further reduce risks before the deposit insurance scheme is introduced. Much has been done recently in that respect.  And if the reforms can't be managed by June?   At the moment, all parties seem to be busy drawing their red lines. It would send a more positive signal to think about what they can achieve together. Let me give you two reasons why this is urgent. First, who knows what the next crisis will look like? If our Monetary Union is not made stronger now, then the ECB will have to come to the rescue again the next time there is a crisis, and this may then lead us to test the limits of our mandate. Who knows what the next crisis will look like?  That's not what Germans expect of a central bank, and rightly so. Second, the world is in disarray, and many expect Europe to show the way. Failing to decide on our own future would send a signal that we don't know what we want.  Germany is being very cautious on Europe at the moment. Olaf Scholz says that a German finance minister is first and foremost a German finance minister. Do you find that disappointing?  Absolutely not. Mr Scholz is doing his job. And he also said that strengthening Europe is very important to the German government. What surprises me about the debate in Germany is that the impression is often given that half of Europe is after Germany's money.  Isn't that the case?   No, above all it's about putting the right rules in place, strengthening the euro area’s institutions and making sure that goods, services and capital markets work better. All of this is in Germany’s interest. And not just because other European countries buy German products, but also because German savings are invested in Europe.   But the French government is also arguing for a European budget and a European finance minister. That is about the money.    I believe that a euro area fiscal capacity can be useful to finance investment, including in economic downturns – provided, of course, that Member States respect Europe’s fiscal rules in the first place.     Many politicians don't like to be told by the ECB what to do or what not to do.    I know that we central bankers sometimes get on politicians' nerves. But it is our job to keep the currency stable, and that requires stable political foundations. The conditions for improving these foundations have rarely been as good as they are now, because the economy is doing well.   And what if the trade disputes escalate?    A fully fledged trade war would have a very negative impact. At the ECB we've analysed the impact of an increase in tariffs worldwide. The results are pretty bleak. But that's not where we are right now. Economic growth has moderated recently, but from exceptionally high levels. So, we are not too concerned at the moment. We expect the economic expansion to continue, and we are increasingly confident that inflation will rise towards our aim of below, but close to, 2%.    So you will soon be able to end your asset purchases?   At the end of last year I said that I didn’t expect that our asset purchase programme would need to be extended again. I see no reason to change my view.  What do you mean exactly?  The programme is currently expected to run until September. We still need to have a discussion about exactly how it will end.   Oh, and we thought that ending it meant ending it, i.e. stopping in September.  The baseline expectation is, as Mario Draghi has said, that there will be no sudden stop. This is a technical discussion.    "
2018-05-18,Vítor Constâncio,Interview with Bloomberg TV,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon on 17 May 2018","  Interview with Bloomberg TV   Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon on 17 May 2018  I'm here with Vítor Constâncio, a man who has been at the heart of ECB policymaking basically since the birth of the euro almost two decades ago. For the last eight years he's been Vice-President. His term expires this month, but over that period, dating back to the all-too-brief period of calm between two recessions, he's been through the unfortunate rate hikes of 2011, quantitative easing, negative interest rates and the rescue of the euro area from deflation – or the threat of deflation at the very least. Today, when the Governing Council is almost, but not quite, ready to talk about exiting stimulus, Vice-President Vítor Constâncio is with me today. It's been quite an eight years, and here we are: you're about to go at a critical moment, because the economy is slowing. How worried are you?  Just a slight slowdown so far – which, by the way, was expected. You may recall that the staff projections that were published, after the high growth of last year, already pointed to a certain deceleration. So, what is happening is still within the bounds of the staff projections for the whole year, which nevertheless forecast growth above 2%.  The Deputy Governor of the Finnish central bank, Olli Rehn, who is tipped to, is likely to join the ECB, has been nominated to do so, he says the medium-term outlook is tilted towards the downside. That's not quite the same as the ECB says.  I have not read what he said, but let me remind you: the projections that have been published, they foresee a growth rate for next year around 2% and then 1.7% for 2020. Indeed, on a path of deceleration, because for demographic reasons and other reasons, potential growth is not very high in Europe – by the way, not also in other advanced economies. We have been growing above potential, especially last year, this year also. Of course, as the output gap closes, we are reverting to potential growth.  Are you still comfortable with market expectations, which are roughly for an end to QE – to net asset purchases – this year, then a rate hike the middle of 2019. Does that sound reasonable?  I won’t comment on that. It's difficult of course to anticipate what may happen. All central banks are to a degree data-dependent, so we monitor of course what is happening. But what I can tell you is that we generally consider that markets have been reading our reaction function quite well. It's also, I presume – or at least, being biased, I will say it – that it's also because of the way we have communicated. Indeed, that understanding of our reaction function has improved over the years and has been quite good recently.  One of the risks the ECB has always been citing is unwarranted market tightening. There's a couple of risks out there; one at the moment is Italy, of course. We've seen bond spreads expand. Some of the wilder ideas, such as asking the ECB to write off €250 billion of debt, have been dropped. There is still this issue about how you measure debt-to-GDP ratios. But the problem is, bond yields, bond prices have been falling, the spreads have been widening. Does that worry you?  We have to monitor that situation, of course. It's a change from what has been happening recently. The problems of Italy are the same, as known by everyone, particularly in the market, of course. The yields and the spreads had been contained until recently. There is this spike. We have to see how it will develop. It depends, of course – as always – very much on the policies that will be actually implemented in Italy, as in other member countries.  You're also watching the euro […] as another issue? The euro's softened quite a bit in recent weeks. In fact, you do get the sense from comments from policymakers that there's not a great deal of concern at the moment about the strength of the euro – which wasn't true a few months ago – or the direction, I should say, of the euro. Is that true?  We were concerned always with excessive volatility in exchange rates, but we don't have a target for the exchange rate, as you know. The volatility in foreign exchange markets, particularly among the advanced economies, has been attributable more to what has happened to the dollar than events linked with other parts of the world. So, that is still the story, and what has happened is that, indeed, we have seen different movements now in the dollar, appreciating also for reasons. Because it's always, markets are very good at doing that, or market analysts, at rationalising what markets are doing. There are, of course, very good narratives explaining why the dollar has been going down and up and now is going up.  So you're reasonably comfortable with where the euro is at the moment?  Yes.  Another risk out there is Iran. This is a slightly tricky one, of course, because Europe now has to deal with the prospect of sanctions on companies that deal with Iran via payments. If it’s involving payments, it's going to involve the ECB one way or another. Presumably the ECB takes a view on this situation?  As you know, there have been sanctions already before. They were lifted after the agreement, and we've gone through that period without major consequences, particularly for the central banks. I am not really expecting that whatever happens in that sphere will have a very meaningful impact on what we will do.  There is a big summit next month, of course, of leaders. It's an important one because there's a new European Parliament next year. What's not agreed at this summit next month might not be agreed for quite some time to come, depending on how Parliament changes. You put out some pretty bold proposals for the way the Monetary Union needs to move in a speech today. How confident are you that any of this is really going to happen?  That was not the perspective of my speech. As I explained, I talked as a technocratic adviser, saying what technically would be necessary to really move towards a very solid Monetary Union, working smoothly, and reducing doubts about the solidity of the whole project. I put forward some technical proposals, but I didn't discuss on purpose the political economy feasibility of what I was saying from a technocratic perspective. It's for governments to make their choices, of course. I do think that the vested interest of all countries is to move forward, deepening the Monetary Union, but it's in the hands of the governments.  Yes, somebody else's job, because you're going to move on. Now, eight years in – and just briefly, if you can – if you had to change one thing, if you'd done one thing differently, or the ECB had done one thing differently, in those eight years, what would it be?  Nothing really very meaningful in the end. I made a speech at the beginning of the month where I talked about the past and future of ECB monetary policy. I went through some episodes that were controversial in some of our decisions in the past. With hindsight, I admit that indeed the decisions were not always perfect and I explained why. I also explained that in both the cases I highlighted in that speech, we very quickly corrected those decisions by changing interest rates in the opposite direction. So, the overall effect of these incidents was in the end not very significant.  Vice-President Constâncio, good luck for whatever comes next. Thank you very much indeed for your time today.    "
2018-05-16,Vítor Constâncio,Interview with the Financial Times,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Claire Jones on 11 May and published on 16 May 2018","  Interview with the Financial Times   Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Claire Jones on 11 May and published on 16 May 2018  People have become concerned about a slowdown in growth, and we’ve recently seen a poor print for core inflation, which is now just 0.7%. What can the ECB do if growth and inflation continue to disappoint? And is there a risk that you don’t have enough ammunition left for the next downturn if the journey to the exit of the non-standard measures is slower than you currently anticipate?   First, let me say that I don’t consider that the slowdown is such an unexpected or serious matter. We knew there would be a deceleration of growth from 2018 onwards. Perhaps some indicators in the first month have been more disappointing than expected, but very slightly so. I still believe that we will have the kind of growth that is forecast in our staff projections, so I am not worried too much about that as long as there is no extraordinary international event that derails world growth. So it’s not an immediate question what the ECB could do next. But it is, of course, to be expected that some time down the road there will be another recession. There is this concern that perhaps, then, monetary policy, with its standard measures, would not have enough policy space to respond to that. It depends on the timing of such an episode. By then, I hope that fiscal policy can become more active in reacting to such a development. It will be very important to have more fiscal space, and to use it. And that’s related to some of the reforms that are needed for monetary union to work better. Presumably, interest rates by then would not be sufficiently high for a reduction in rates to be a sufficient response. Other monetary policy tools, then, would have to be used. I think one possibility would be to go into yield curve control, meaning targeting specifically some interest rates for longer term maturities. That would require lower amounts of purchases to be achieved than we have at the moment under our asset purchase programme. It would work because it could lower medium to long-term interest rates, which are the relevant ones for expenditure decisions.  Yield curve control is being used already in Japan – and it works. It has not distorted markets. [Former Chair of the US Federal Reserve Ben] Bernanke has a good answer to this issue of distorting the markets, which is to say that purchases by the central bank of government securities with different maturities have exactly the same impact as a change in maturities done by the Treasury itself.  The public sector always impacts the yield curve, one way or the other. The idea is that if the central bank uses an active policy to do so, then it’s to correct distortions that exist in financial markets and ensure that lending rates to businesses and households in the economy as a whole are at the right level to get to the level of activity that would be desirable. If there are rigidities and distortions in the private sector that do not engineer the smooth functioning of the economy, then public intervention is fully justified. It does not add up to manipulation because the reality is not perfect to start with. I’m just now thinking in very abstract terms; this was never discussed at the ECB’s Governing Council. This is my personal take on possibilities; it is not more than that. We didn’t start any discussion about the medium-term future of monetary policy, it’s too soon in Europe to start thinking about that.  But I’ll just say it’s a possibility and it can work. We could buy more bonds to enforce it – the 33% limit [that the ECB has on buying all of the outstanding stock of a country’s government bonds] is a self-binding decision by the Governing Council. That decision could be slightly changed, theoretically, of course.  What about the use of the other non-standard measures? There is a view that some of the tools, such as the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme, are closely linked with the current ECB leadership and not as much with the ECB itself.    It’s important to underline that the unconventional measures that we used – all of them are now part of the ECB toolkit. So in the future, if ever we face again stressful situations in the euro area, the ECB would have no excuse not to use such instruments to stabilise the situation.  That I wanted to repeat: it would be virtually impossible, if such a stressful situation occurred again, for the ECB to ignore that these instruments are effective, legal and part of the toolkit.  People are important of course, but this transcends people.   What are you going to be watching in the coming months, from outside the ECB, in terms of trying to judge the health of the eurozone economy?  The real activity indicators [such as purchasing managers’ indices] are very important, but in view of our ultimate objective the way inflation will continue to react will be also very important. Our staff projections indicate that inflation could be subdued in the first part of the year and could increase a bit in the second half of the year. So we hope that this will materialise, in order to ensure that what we forecast in the projections for the years to come will really happen.  What are your expectations for the June European Council meeting?    I hope I am wrong, but unfortunately I am not expecting much from the next summit. The European economy is going through a good patch of growth. That, of course, always reduces government’s motivations to take bold decisions. As Jean Monnet said, humans take important decisions only in a state of need. Which means in a state of crisis. I expect, nevertheless, that the fiscal backstop for the Single Resolution Fund will be decided, and that there will be some kind of long-term promises about a European Deposit Insurance Scheme.  There is also an absence of a macroeconomic tool to automatically stabilise the economy. On fiscal policy, we need two things to address this gap.  First, we need coordination of national fiscal policies to become stricter and discussed more from the perspective of the euro area as a whole. This is a very important thing that should have already happened. The second thing is a type of macro stabilisation fund, along the lines of a rainy-day fund, like the IMF has proposed. Let’s see what happens. France has proposed something along these lines. There are also proposals on the table from others. That would be one of my priorities for reform.  What about the other side of the coin? Germany and others are calling for risk reduction?    First, I would say there has been a huge amount of risk reduction already. The periphery countries have undertaken huge adjustments; they’ve gone from big deficits, both in the budget and the external current account, to complying with EU rules.  All the countries that experienced an acute crisis – Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain – now have budgets with deficits below 3% of GDP and a positive primary balance in their current account, with the exception of Spain. Last year, Spain still had a primary deficit of 0.5%, but this year it is very likely that they will also make a surplus. In some cases, this adjustment in the primary balance was in the double-digits, which is huge. Our analysis, and the IMF’s, shows that the positive current accounts that all of these peripheral countries have built are the result of a structural adjustment. This is not about lower imports and weaker demand; it is about the improved performance of exports and structural adjustments. And that’s very important.  Second, in terms of the banking sector, the capital level of banks everywhere has increased and the average common equity ratio of banks here is 14.3%. There is no bank below 11% in the euro area. That also represents a huge reduction of risk. Then, third, there is the BRRD [Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive], which rules that if there will be any collapse of banks, then no bailouts by the public sector can be engineered – at least before there is a private bail-in of 8% of the total assets of the bank. So that’s a big risk reduction for national government budgets and for taxpayers. Banks are also building up their bail-in-able securities. And the fact that the BRRD has to be applied before any loan by the European Stability Mechanism is made to a bank means that, very likely, there will not be any direct recapitalisation on a European level.  So there is a long list of things, not to mention the reduction in non-performing loans. NPLs have been subject to intense action by supervisors. The average amount of NPLs compared with the total amount of credit came down to 4.8% last year, from slightly above 8% in 2013. Of course, there are around 30 banks that still have higher – in some cases, much higher – NPL ratios, but the targets are there. And the banks beat their targets to reduce their bad loans last year. So it’s working, it’s going in the right direction.  In a nutshell, enough risk reduction has been achieved to justify introducing elements of risk-sharing in the banking union project.  And that would be a European Deposit Insurance Scheme?  That would be EDIS and the backstop for the Single Resolution Fund, the latter being, in practice, not so important since it would rarely be used.[1]   How do you think this taking on of responsibility for banking supervision is working?    There are risks in everything, of course, but I have always been in favour of having banking supervision with the central bank. That has been the tradition in my country, and there are many good arguments for that.  Back in 2001 the Governing Council of the ECB, on the basis of a proposal coming from Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, issued a short paper lining up the arguments for having supervision in a central bank. And if you read that paper, you will see that the set of arguments is heavily tilted towards favouring giving supervision to central banks. So it’s a long-standing position.[2]  There are many advantages, including one that is not mentioned in the paper: supervision is not just about micro-supervision these days; it now has a macro-financial perspective, for which central banks are much better prepared than any other institution to handle. Central banks monitor developments in all segments of the financial system.   From reading your most recent speech, I had the impression that you thought austerity went much too far and the effects have been too drastic. Is that right?  Yes. And the main example of that is of course the case of Greece. No institution, not the Commission, not the ECB, not the IMF, ever thought possible – let alone planned for – a 25% drop in GDP in Greece. The first and second programmes for Greece were designed with a much more optimistic view on the cost of the adjustment. So the adjustment programme was indeed too harsh. And also perhaps too mechanical, because what the programme didn’t foresee was the total collapse of hope and expectations.  Then, at the same time, all countries in the euro area were reducing deficits, consolidating. That is, as I quote in my speech, the cause of the double-dip that we had in 2012, 2013, which should not have happened. And was the result of fiscal policy, not monetary policy.   So why are you so optimistic that next time it will be better, that fiscal policy can step into the breach during the next downturn?   In the first place, I don’t anticipate that we will have the sort of imbalances that we had at that time. Everyone has learned lessons and it’s very unlikely that Member States’ economies will become as imbalanced again. The adjustment that the more stressed countries went through shows that those Members States are now able to work effectively in the framework of the Monetary Union. Both in terms of the fiscal rules and in terms of the sort of level of structural change that we have seen in the past few years.  Do you think it was a mistake for the ECB to become involved in the Troika?  It was in a way unavoidable in view of the acuteness of the crisis we had, and good that it happened. Everyone wanted us to be there and we could not of course refuse what was then the expectation of everyone that we would help out with our expertise.  To what degree do you think austerity and the crisis have influenced the current political mood?  I think it plays a big role. I was just reading a paper written by three German economists on extreme politics, in a very good economic journal, about the political consequences of big recessions in 20 countries from 1870 to the present day.[3] And indeed they show a correlation between extreme severe downturns and the political polarisation. Only in the case of financial crises during the ensuing five years, far-right parties increased on average their voting share by 30%. Far-left parties never benefited much from financial crises.  And so I’m not saying that the increase in populism, liberal democracy is some authoritarian drive, it’s only the result of the economic crisis; there are other factors, but it’s certainly a big one.  Let’s talk more about the crisis. Can you remember the first moment when you became concerned?  I became concerned at the beginning of 2010, when, back in February, the budget deficits of several countries for 2009 were known and were higher than anyone expected. Particularly, of course in Greece, which recorded a deficit of 15% instead of an expected 5.6%, but also other countries. We started to feel the pressure in the bond market after that, so those were the first signs of something really becoming serious. Then it intensified. We had a meeting of the Governing Council in Lisbon on 5 May, just a few weeks before I came here to the ECB. That was the day of the flash crash in Wall Street, with huge repercussions in bond markets everywhere. Shortly afterwards, we decided to create the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) to start purchasing government bonds of several countries. That was an important moment. And, of course, at the same time, there was then the big loan to Greece, the creation of the European Financial Stability Fund, so those months of May, June 2010 were crucial. We were very active and it was the first big manifestation of the crisis. The peak of concern was more in the second half of 2011, first half of 2012, because that was when the markets, without any change in economic fundamentals, started to attack heavily the government debt of Spain and Italy. There was contagion and, at the end of 2011, I spoke about the ECB’s analysis of this, which showed it was already influencing, for instance, the price of French debt. So indeed, it was a development that was quite dangerous.  We decided on a second round of the SMP, ended up with the OMT decision and injecting a big supply of liquidity, €1 trillion. It wasn’t particularly the French contagion that forced it, more the continuation of the pressure in the bond markets throughout the first months of 2012. We had to do something more significant than just a second round of the SMP. It clearly seemed that was not enough. These decisions, plus the decisions of the European summit of June 2012, ended the acute phase of the euro area’s existential crisis.   How have you seen the relationship with markets and with banks change during your 34 years in central banking?    Back when I began, the European financial system was much more bank-based than it is now. That was true everywhere, but it was particularly true in Europe. Monetary policy was totally directed towards bank’s behaviour.  In 1973 in the United Kingdom, you had limits to deposits, which was a new attempt to put some limit on banks’ ability to expand their balance sheets. Many other European had credit ceilings. Italy, France, Portugal, Spain all had ceilings, some up to the end of the 1980s. It was only after that that more market-based monetary policy instruments started to become more significant. The growing importance of markets and the liberalisation of the controls exerted by central banks on the activity of banks started to change monetary policy in Europe completely, especially since the 1990s. We’ve ended up with the present inflation targeting regimes, using interest rates as the main tool to control the spectrum of market interest rates. The importance of banks in financing the economy has continued to decline and this requires a change in approach in the future. All these new fields beyond banking require some degree of regulation that is still not there, and this in my view will become more and more clear as market-based finance continues to grow to a huge size. The approach will need to become much more intrusive, and will be a return to the past in that respect.   What will that entail?    Controlling the excesses of finance cannot be achieved only with monetary policy interest rates. We need to expand the concept of leverage to other segments of the financial system, particularly synthetic leverage. I mean leverage which is not easily seen in the balance sheet, because it’s built up with derivatives. It’s not seen but it’s very relevant for banks and for the economy, as we saw during the crisis. The obstacles to regulating markets, and not just banks, are not so much technical; the obstacles are more political or ideological. It requires more regulation and supervision by not only central banks, but also in some cases governments. It is politicians that often need to enforce macroprudential measures, and in some countries some governments do not want to use them.  Another aspect that is different now is that we have in our economies too much finance. There is a strand of literature showing that after certain limits there are diminishing returns in the expansion of finance. And to tame these imbalances we will also need macroprudential measures.   You have talked about the need to reform economics too. What do you have in mind?  Big changes are happening, we are going in the right direction, but in my view we are not there yet.  The joke in the American camp at the beginning of the 1980s was that macro is just bad micro, meaning that the models had become dominated by the idea that agents make optimal economic decisions over infinite horizons into the future and that markets therefore tend to be self-equilibrating towards a single steady state.  Central banks’ standard models – DGSE [Dynamic General Stochastic Equilibrium] models – have been transformed in many ways, but the 1980s view has still not fully disappeared.  This has to change. Economic agents clearly have finite horizons, which impact on their consumption decisions. People do not optimise and plan their lives up to their death. Nor does the financial sector play as important a part in models as it should. The possibility of multiple equilibria has also to be introduced; there are fallacies of composition, there are coordination failures. All these elements have to become part and parcel of macroeconomics; macroeconomics is not just the aggregation of individual decisions by optimising agents, we should not just assume everything moves towards a general equilibrium of competitive markets. The absolute minimum that has to happen is to rid macroeconomics of the imperialism of a certain type of microeconomic foundations; a new core model for macroeconomics has to emerge.  If agents act in different ways, we also have to address the question of income distribution. And fortunately there are already models, so-called HANK models, Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian models, that consider this. There is a very nice paper in the latest NBER issue which is called “When Inequality Matters to Macro and Macro Matters for Inequality”. So indeed, that places within macro the question of inequality – inequality which has been increasing too much in the past few decades. Changes are being discussed and are taking place I just hope that progress could be quicker.  How does that impact central banking? We thought we could just target inflation, now you are saying the next generation has to consider all of these different preferences of agents, multiple equilibria, inequality...  Well first of all, central banks will always focus mostly on control of inflation, or more broadly macroeconomic stabilisation. The regime of flexible inflation targeting will not change in the visible horizon, and that is because it allows central banks to take a medium-term perspective towards hitting the inflation target. The advantage of adopting this gradualist approach to reaching the target, is – as [leading monetary economist and former Riksbank official] Lars Svensson has demonstrated very convincingly – that you can allow for some consideration of stabilisation of the economy in trying to move gradually towards the inflation target.  What will change are the models used to analyse the consequences of policy – and the set of instruments that will have to be used. Central banks in the future will have to respond in a different way if they want to achieve the overall objective of reasonable inflation and macroeconomic stabilisation.  The growing complexity of market-based finance and the change in the financial system will make it difficult for central banks to go back completely to the old, comfortable, traditional approach of having very lean balance sheets and just targeting the overnight money market rate. The set of instruments will have to be broadened. Several have been used during the crisis, some of them just for very stressful periods of course, but they are now part of the toolkit.   Do you think what you’re saying is shared by other people on the Governing Council?  I wouldn’t speculate on that. This view is developing in academia everywhere and has been discussed extensively in [the Kansas City Federal Reserve’s flagship conference in] Jackson Hole in 2016, for instance. So it’s part of the ongoing discussion at the interface between academia and central banking.  Do you think the ECB has done enough to justify the impact of its policies on inequality? If we were to do quantitative easing (QE) again, would helicopter money be a better option?    Helicopter money has never been a policy option. We are attentive to the question of inequality. I spoke in August last year to the European Economic Association about inequality and monetary policy, and since then further work has been done in the ECB to expand on what I said.  First, if we take into account the effects of QE and non-conventional monetary policy combined, we have shown that those effects on income as a result of lower unemployment are more significant than the effects of high prices for financial assets. Turning to wealth distribution, what extraordinary monetary policy clearly does is to increase the price of assets, particularly of course risky assets. But people are too fixated on the increase in the price of stocks; one has to look to the overall impact on other asset prices. If we look at the increases in bond prices or in equities, which are indeed owned mainly by wealthy people, they are totally overwhelmed by the increase in housing prices. The rise in house prices make up the bulk of the wealth effect, and the wealth tied in houses is held by the middle income segments of the population. In terms of the overall wealth distribution, the situation has improved rather than becoming more unequal as a result of our extraordinary policies.   Over the course of your career what are you most proud of?  I’m proud of many things I’ve done in my 34 years in central banking. I am proud that I eliminated credit ceilings in my country when I was Governor and introduced a market-based system of monetary policy with the creation of auctions for treasury bills. I also ended the fixation that Portugal had on its exchange rate, which involved daily auctions with market players. We modernised the bank and the financial system during the 1980s, so that is one thing.  Here at the ECB, I’ve overseen the creation of a macroprudential policy and financial stability department, which is state of the art. And I am proud of course of having participated actively in all of the policy decisions that happened since I came here in 2010, especially those that put a stop to the existential crisis over the future of the euro.  Is there any decision that the ECB took that in hindsight you regret?  The rate hike in 2008 was an overreaction. There seemed to be some justification at the time for the increase in rates in 2011, though in hindsight it was clearly premature. That’s it, I already said it in the speech.  Will you stay in Germany or are you going to go back to Portugal?  I’m going back to Portugal. In June, I will be at the ECB conference in Sintra. Normally we invite former members of the Executive Board, so I hope they will continue to invite me. Particularly as I don’t intend to go and work for any private financial institution. I will do some postgraduate teaching in Madrid.  I always hoped I would have the opportunity to be a free intellectual. In my career I never had that luxury.  I always thought and dreamed about it, and I hope to have a sufficient number of years to satisfy that ambition. I am going to have a blog. It’s usual in the United States; in other places, not so usual. I will comment on general questions about the future, about Europe, about macroeconomics.  What will your first post be about?  I am still hesitating. It could be about the future of monetary policy and the points I left out in my recent speech, from neutral interest rates to yield curve control.   Are there any rules that bind you in terms of what you can write about?  Beyond the ECB rules what will bind me is European decorum.

2018-04-26,Sabine Lautenschläger,Risk reduction in the euro area – how low can you go?,"Contribution by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Eurofi Newsletter, 26 April 2018","  Risk reduction in the euro area – how low can you go?   Contribution by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Eurofi Newsletter, 26 April 2018 The financial crisis demonstrated that risks need to be kept in check, both at bank level and at systemic level. To that end, the euro area has taken many steps over recent years. It has grown closer together and this has helped to reduce risks. The European banking union is the centrepiece of these efforts. The first pillar, European banking supervision, was set up in 2014 to ensure that banks across the euro area are supervised to the same high standards. To that end, we have harmonised the supervisory approach applied to the 118 largest banking groups. In the process, we made use of the discretion contained in both the European and the national frameworks. This enabled us, for example, to move in 2014 from 19 different Supervisory Review and Evaluation Processes to a single harmonised one. This and many other changes in day-to-day supervision help to reduce risks and ensure that banks remain both safe and sound. The second pillar of the banking union was established in 2016: the Single Resolution Mechanism. This ensures that banks can fail in an orderly manner. The failure of a bank must not pose a threat to financial stability or to public funds. Recent bank failures have shown that the new system works; supervisory and resolution authorities have cooperated smoothly and effectively. This new institutional set-up is a good basis for reducing risks, but it needs further refinement. Regulation, for instance, needs to be further harmonised. To reap the full benefits of the banking union, we need a harmonised regulatory framework. First, there is the issue of options and national discretions (ONDs). While some of these ONDs have been harmonised by supervisors, others lie in the hands of national legislators. Waivers for large exposure limits, for instance, are still fragmented across the euro area. This in turn affects other cross-border waivers, such as that on liquidity requirements. More generally, it stands in the way of a truly European banking market, as do the other ONDs that fall within the competence of national legislators. Second, recent bank failures have shown that we need to further harmonise the tools for crisis management. We need to remove the overlap between standard supervisory measures and early intervention measures, for instance. As we are obliged to apply the least intrusive tool, the overlap often prevents us from taking early intervention measures. We also need to expand our toolbox to include a harmonised moratorium tool. Finally, national insolvency laws need to be aligned. All this would make the Single Resolution Mechanism even more effective. These measures will help to better contain risks in the future. However, we also have to reduce the risks we face today. Non-performing loans (NPLs) currently pose one of the biggest risks to the European banking sector. They need to be dealt with first and foremost by the banks themselves. Some progress has been made on this front, although more needs to be done. In addition, supervisors need to play their part. European supervisors closely monitor how banks approach NPLs, and in 2017 and 2018 the ECB published guidance on the subject. The aim is not only to resolve the current NPL problem, but also to keep it from recurring in the future. Finally, legislators also need to address the issue of NPLs. Across the euro area, legal and judicial systems differ substantially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency when it comes to dealing with NPLs. The time and resources required to resolve NPLs thus differ from country to country. National legislators should strive to improve legal and judicial frameworks. In the end, tackling NPLs requires a joint effort by banks, supervisors and legislators. To sum up, there are still things we can do to reduce risks in the euro area. In doing so, we will grow closer together, and that in turn will help to reduce risks further; European banking supervision is a prime example of this. We must thus be careful not to reach a point where we neither reduce risks nor grow closer together. We have to keep moving on both fronts; only then will we reach our destination of a more stable and prosperous European Union.   "
2018-04-26,Yves Mersch,Monetary policy in the euro area: solid expansion with timid price pressure,"Contribution of Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, to the EUROFI magazine, submitted on 21 March 2018 and published on 26 April 2018","  Monetary policy in the euro area: solid expansion with timid price pressure   Contribution of Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, to the EUROFI magazine, submitted on 21 March 2018 and published on 26 April 2018 The euro area economy currently is solidly expanding and the upswing is broad-based. Recent data indicate that in the near term the economy is likely to expand even faster than had been expected. The monetary policy measures introduced since 2014 have effectively supported growth and employment, with real GDP growth expected to remain consistently above potential growth in the coming years. In spite of the favourable growth dynamics, underlying inflation continues to be subdued. While our policy measures have been successful in preventing the disinflation of 2014 from spiralling into deflation and are contributing to an improved inflation outlook, an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Looking ahead, the evolution of monetary policy will be firmly guided by the outlook for price stability. In this regard, the transition towards policy normalisation will begin once the Governing Council assesses that there has been a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. Such a judgement will be based on three criteria for inflation: convergence, confidence and resilience. Convergence implies that headline inflation will need to be on track to reach levels below, but close to, 2% within a medium-term horizon. The Governing Council will also need to have confidence that the upward adjustment in inflation has a high enough probability of materialising and that it can do so on a sustainable basis. Thirdly, resilience, it will need to be ensured that the sustained adjustment in the path of inflation will be maintained even without additional net asset purchases.  In fact, confidence has recently risen and convergence is being confirmed - partly because the temporary decline in the inflation rate has been weaker than our internal calculations had predicted when we had reduced the purchasing program from EUR 60 billion to EUR 30 billion. More resilience will follow eventually. Still, patience and persistence with respect to our monetary policy is required. The former is necessary as it takes time for price pressures to build-up and the latter reflects the fact that the pick-up in inflation still needs to be supported by the prevailing monetary policy stance. Once the Governing Council judges that progress towards meeting the three criteria is sufficiently advanced, our net asset purchases will be brought to an end. This is in line with our guidance on the expanded asset purchase programme (APP). Thereafter, the monetary support necessary for inflation to converge to our aim of below, but close to, 2% will be provided by reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time and policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of our net asset purchases. Policy decisions will continue to be firmly guided by the outlook for price stability for the euro area as a whole and not for any individual country. The ECB remains committed to its price stability mandate, but other actors need to do their part to boost the resilience of the euro area and individual economies. Governments should take advantage of the increasingly solid and broad-based recovery to rebuild their fiscal buffers in line with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). At the same time measures to increase euro area economies’ productivity should be forcefully pursued. And finally, the completion of the banking and financial unions would be a substantial step towards strengthening the euro area’s capacity to withstand any future shocks.    "
2018-04-10,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with France Info,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean Leymarie on 9 April 2018 and published on 10 April 2018","  Interview with France Info   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean Leymarie on 9 April 2018 and published on 10 April 2018  We are still seeing growth in Europe, there is certainly growth, but it seems increasingly clear that it is slowing down. Does that worry you?  I don’t think we are seeing a slowdown in growth. This is something that we monitor very closely, we follow all the indicators. We are seeing indicators that had risen to very, very high levels, levels that had not been seen for many years, in some cases 10 or 15 years. And these indicators are now undergoing a slight correction that was fairly inevitable, as there comes a point when growth stops accelerating and stabilises on a certain trajectory. Moreover, this was already incorporated in our forecasts. So we will not be revising our forecasts at present as a result of this correction. I can’t speak for the future – we will continue to monitor these developments – but, for now, it’s a stabilisation, and it’s not something that particularly concerns us.  Could it result in a change in your monetary policy?  No, for the reasons I have just given. Again, I’m not going to speak for the future, since everything is completely dependent on the data we receive on an ongoing basis. But monetary policy follows a long-term trajectory, one that requires patience. We know that monetary policy will need to remain very accommodative for quite some time.  Just to remind our listeners: there is, in particular, the huge asset purchase programme you launched three years ago, which has involved buying public and private sector securities for the vast sum of €2,500 billion. When are you going to end this programme?  That is a discussion that we will certainly be having soon, since the programme is currently proceeding at a monthly pace of €30 billion until at least September. We haven’t said any more than that. So, we’ll need to have a discussion fairly soon about what comes next…  Will it have come to a stop by the end of the year?  I don’t know yet, because the Governing Council of the ECB has not yet discussed it, let alone reached a decision. But the discussion is not just about asset purchases, it’s also about the right combination of instruments that allows us to support economic activity and bring inflation back towards 2%. There are not just the asset purchases, there are also interest rates. And on this, we have been clear that interest rates will remain at their current levels, that is, very, very low, close to zero – even below zero – for a long period, even beyond the horizon of our asset purchases. So we need to look at the longer term.  In the event of an economic slowdown – and, again, it is a possibility – do you have the means to respond effectively?  It’s not a possibility that we are currently talking about, because right now there is no reason to worry about growth in the euro area. Growth is very strong, very robust and very broad-based across the euro area. But whatever the circumstances, the ECB has a clear mandate: to bring inflation back towards 2%. We will do whatever needs to be done to bring inflation back towards 2%. But at the moment there is no need to adjust the path that has been decided on by the Governing Council.  Inflation is currently at 1.4%...  Yes, it’s just under 1.5%.  Is that a good level?  It’s not enough, it’s disappointing. But we know the reasons: it’s because unemployment is still high and there is a lot of economic slack in Europe. But we want to bring inflation back towards 2% in the medium term, and that is why monetary policy will remain accommodative.  The major issue at present are the threats issued by the US President, Donald Trump, who blows hot and cold on trade policy, and in particular this power struggle he has embarked on with China. Should Europe get involved at this stage?  As a large trading power, Europe is bound to be affected…  For now, Trump is saying “I’ll threaten Europe but without specific customs barriers on European products”…  Europe has a single trade policy and that means it has to react, and not just to the threat of import tariffs. It also needs to look at the source of the problem, that is, overcapacity throughout the world, and in particular overcapacity in China. This is not a matter for the ECB, of course; it’s a matter for the European Commission and for EU governments. What’s important for us, from an economic perspective, is that we avoid an escalation and avoid belligerent language. If there were to be a trade war, it could be very damaging for the global economy…  Is what we are experiencing a trade war?  Not yet. There are threats, skirmishes, you might say, but it is not yet a trade war. If we were to plunge into a trade war, that could have a very damaging effect, also on the US economy…  Have you put a figure on it at the ECB, have you drawn up a scenario?  Yes, we have drawn up a scenario – which is worth as much as scenarios and models are worth – but it’s a scenario that does not reflect the current situation and the current declarations of the US President. Rather, it’s a scenario in which all countries increase their import tariffs by 10%: a true trade war scenario that is very severe. In this scenario, we see a significant drop in global activity that also affects the United States, and that is precisely what we now need to avoid.  How large a drop?  2.5% of GDP in the United States, and 1% of GDP on a global level.  Would that be a serious situation?  It would be a very serious situation and it must be avoided. Governments are responsible for avoiding it, and above all for resolving these differences on a multilateral basis.  But that’s exactly what Donald Trump doesn’t want – he rejects such multilateral frameworks…  It’s not what Mr Trump wants, true, but it’s what Europe wants. Europe wants the world to be managed in an inclusive way where everybody gathers round the table for discussions.   Would you urge Europeans to “make themselves heard”? What is your message to them?  They are speaking up. They don’t need the ECB to lecture them, a trade policy already exists. Discussions between countries are under way in Brussels and the European Commission has already started working on it.  I’d also like us to talk about another subject entirely – the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It’s an important issue that was the subject of much discussion a few weeks ago. Bitcoin rocketed in value several months ago before falling back; at one point one bitcoin was worth almost USD 20,000, but today it’s around USD 7,000. Is this the end of bitcoin?  It’s undoubtedly the end of an illusion – that bitcoin could become a global currency that would eventually replace the dollar or the euro. We can clearly see that bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, cannot be considered reliable assets, or as economists like to say, a “store of value”, when their value fluctuates so much. This isn’t how you go about investing your savings for your retirement. But we shouldn’t disregard the possibilities opened up by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, particularly on the technological front. It’s something that all central banks are looking at. For example, we’re investigating whether “blockchain” technology, which underpins bitcoin, could one day support our payment systems. This sort of thinking is useful, important and positive.  But for bitcoin defenders it’s not just about the technology. It’s almost a philosophy for them – they see it as a free currency that can throw off the shackles of states and central banks. Do you understand that?  Yes, and I think we must take heed of that. Investors should be warned about the specific dangers of investing in bitcoin, and everybody has done so. But we also have to understand what this tells us – technologies exist that can transform the world of payments and currencies, and these technologies should be incorporated. It’s also telling us that there is a certain amount of defiance towards the traditional financial system, and potentially that everything we have done since the financial crisis to reform the banks, clean up the financial system and reduce risks may not have been enough, or may not have been understood. And that’s something we have to take on board.   "
2018-04-06,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with CNBC,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Steve Sedgwick on 6 April 2018","  Interview with CNBC   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Steve Sedgwick on 6 April 2018  You've been talking about trade and that is the key topic here in Cernobbio and indeed globally at the moment as well. What's your contribution this morning on this topic?  The point I was making this morning at the conference is that first we're not sure yet that we're in a trade war. As much as possible, if we could avoid the bellicose semantics and come back to a reasonable discussion, that would help for economic confidence. That also means that if this would morph into a full-fledged trade war, this has the potential to have quite damaging consequences for growth and jobs globally, including in the US.  Is it already having ramifications in global financial markets? We've seen the volatility and equity markets. We've seen higher borrowing costs as well. It looks like it's already having the effects of a trade war without being a trade war yet.  To some extent, yes, we've seen that. We've seen obviously stock prices going down, some risk premia are going up, so some tightening of financial conditions globally starting with the US. But it all depends on how the situation will evolve. Certainly what we don't want to see is a general tightening of financial conditions.  In terms of the effect it's going to have on rate raising on both sides of the Atlantic, what do you see as the ramifications for interest rate policy first perhaps for Federal Reserve and then for the ECB?  For the Federal Reserve I wouldn't dare comment. I don't think they would like it too much and it's not my job. As far as the eurozone is concerned, so far I would say we can look through. It all comes against a backdrop of a very strong growth momentum, very broad. This recovery, this expansion is the strongest we had for at least 10 years. In terms of its breadth across the board, across sectors, across economies, that's the broadest we had for the last 20 years, I would say. The starting point is a very good one and the economy is quite resilient.   There are two reasons why bonds go up, why yields go up or the rates on those bonds go up and yields go up and interest rates go up; One, the economy is going very, very well – or sometimes the economy is going very, very badly. Then the ECB perhaps has to step in again. Do you fear the ECB has to take more action to offset the negative effects of a potential trade war?  That's not a discussion we're having today. The discussion we're having today is on how the mix of our instruments will have to change in the future. I think there is very broad agreement in the Governing Council of the ECB that a high degree of monetary accommodation will remain needed and that's irrespective of the trade war or anything we've seen recently. That's because the economy and in particular the inflation in the eurozone is not yet where we want to see it. Monetary accommodation will remain needed but we'll see a change in the mix of our instruments. In particular as we come closer to the point where our medium-term inflation objective is met, I would expect the role of rate guidance to be strengthened. We've been clear on that.  In terms of the models which you must be running that a trade war could affect as well and could affect Europe as well, those models would've been run at the ECB, I'm sure. What are they saying?  They clearly say that a trade war would have a damaging impact on the global economy, more so in the US and more so in economies which are either very closely related to the US or are deeply integrated in global value chains. The impact on the eurozone would be less and it all depends on how this conversation on trade will evolve and we don't know yet. That's why I'm saying we should look through it.  Does the ECB have the tools, though, to negate the effects of a trade war if indeed the worst ramifications do happen?  We are very much data driven; we are driven by facts. We'll look at how all kinds of circumstances, including trade but also the global economy generally and the momentum we have in Europe, feeds into eurozone inflation and that will be the basis for our decisions. So far we are coming from a starting point which is strong and where we have increasing confidence that our inflation objective will be met.  When I look at some of the wage deals going around at the moment in Germany and beyond, I see very healthy wage growth of some of those deals as well. When's that going to start feeding through into broader inflation, the kind of figures you want to see to be able to feel more comfortable about raising rates to a normalised level?  We've seen some uptick in inflation even in the most recent numbers. It is slow, because we are starting from a point where unemployment at eurozone level was high and broad. We know that it takes time for it to translate into wage pressures. We have to be patient, but there is no reason to think that this will not translate into higher price and wage pressures. We've started to see it.  In terms of the cover you've given countries like Italy and others as well, do you feel they've squandered that cover that the ECB has given and the support the ECB has given them through a lower yield and lower borrowing cost? We still seem to be going through the same arguments, the same structural issues. In fact if anything a potential new government in Italy could scrap some of the reforms that the ECB so applauded.  Certainly the advice we are giving to governments, insofar we can give advice to governments, because they are independent from us as much as we are independent from them. The only advice we can give is to use that environment of strong growth, of lower rates to build the buffers in the economy. That includes building fiscal buffers but that also includes doing structural reforms so that the economy can become stronger.  Listening to some of the more recent speeches from Mr Draghi and hearing comments from yourself and others, I don't get the impression that the ECB feels that their opportunity has been taken. Am I wrong?  There has been some disappointment on the fiscal side where we believe that governments generally could have made better use of the windfall of lower rates to reduce their deficits, to consolidate their finances in a more permanent way, in a more structural way. That's true. Now, when it comes to reforms in the real economy we've seen a lot going on. Look at how much Spain has reformed its labour market. That's now yielding very positive results in terms of job creation. Look at what France is doing, which really goes in the right direction, so reforms are being done.  Are they being done in Italy?  I cannot really comment on Italy at that current stage where we are in a political flux and that's clearly not our role to step into that.  Apart from trade and your desire to see greater productivity reform, structural reforms, fiscal buffers as well, what are the other issues that you have greatest concern about at the moment in global markets, global economy?  Trade – as we just discussed – is clearly top of the agenda. That's the biggest concern we have today.  And Brexit?  Brexit is a concern but there is a political negotiation and the ECB is not part of this political negotiation. We very much hope that this can be settled in a way that makes it smooth, that does not harm confidence. But we also trust that it can be settled in a way that preserves the integrity of the European project in terms of the four freedoms, in terms of the single market, in terms of having effective ways to regulate our financial industry and to supervise our financial industry to achieve stability in Europe.  A huge part of the EU financial industry is based in the United Kingdom, the fundraising for the broader EU is based in many ways in the United Kingdom. The clearing, the forex, the bond trading as well. If that is taken away or the access for those markets is taken away, that leaves a huge black hole for countries like Germany, for Ireland, for countries that actually feel that they could fill that gap. They can't necessarily, can they?  Any such movement has to be decided by the industry. It has to be led by the market. What we want to see as a central bank, what we want to see as overseer, as supervisor is that effective supervision continues to be delivered wherever the financial industry is located. Location choices should be for the industry to make themselves.  You have no doubt, regardless of the final status of the relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe, that your relationship with the regulators, with Mr Carney and what have you, will be exactly the same as it is now?  What I can say at the current juncture is that our relationship with the Bank of England is one of the main assets we have. We have a trust relationship with the Bank of England and that will be a very strong asset for the future.   "
2018-03-28,Benoît Cœuré,Taking back control of globalisation: Sovereignty through European integration,"Contribution of Benoît Cœuré, member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, to the 2018 Schuman Report on Europe, 28 March 2018","  Taking back control of globalisation: Sovereignty through European integration    Contribution of Benoît Cœuré, member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, to the 2018 Schuman Report on Europe, 28 March 2018  There has been a backlash against globalisation and international cooperation in recent years [1] . In Europe, Brexit and Euroscepticism have challenged the notion of the European Union (EU) as a political construct based on shared sovereignty, freedom of movement across borders and economic integration under a common legislative framework. In the United States, meanwhile, the benefits of free trade have been openly called into question. Europe was generally believed to be under the greatest threat from this trend. Even if the United States were to retreat from globalisation, that would not undermine the integrity of the country itself. In the case of Europe, however, the EU and the commitment to shared values and an open society are in many ways inseparable. More recently, stronger growth and falling unemployment have supported an improvement in attitudes towards the EU. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey,[2] seven out of ten Europeans now regard themselves as citizens of the EU – the highest level ever recorded for this indicator. What is more, three out of four euro area citizens now support the euro – the highest level since 2004. Meanwhile, an increasing number of Europeans are optimistic about the future of the EU, and the percentage of respondents who regard the EU as “a place of stability in a troubled world” now stands at 71% – up 5 percentage points since 2016. We need to take advantage of this opportunity and help Europe to make further progress. If we do not, the European project could end up at risk again sooner or later. The reason for acting is obvious: people’s basic fears about the risks of openness have not really receded. Improved economic prospects can help to soothe such worries, but they will resurface in difficult times. Still, the EU can provide a lasting answer to those fears. Indeed, just as the EU is under threat from the backlash against globalisation, it can provide a way to manage globalisation. This is, after all, not the first time that globalisation has been on trial: the period between the First and Second World Wars showed that unregulated global markets are liable to descend into protectionism and nationalism. The lesson here is that cross-border integration is only sustainable if it is regulated and organised by institutions that safeguard the stability of the economic and financial system, ensure a level playing field, settle disputes and contribute to solidarity among members. This is what the EU gives to the people of Europe: a way of sustaining an open international order while also bending its outcomes to their will. Taking concerns about globalisation seriously There are four basic reasons why people in Europe and beyond are worried about globalisation and open markets. The first concern relates to stability – i.e. the question of whether globalisation has made countries more vulnerable to harmful spillovers from abroad and to international crises. This applies in areas such as agriculture, medicines and biotechnology, but it is perhaps much more visible in the case of international capital flows (i.e. financial globalisation). From the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s to the global financial crisis of the late 2000s and the euro area sovereign debt crisis of the early 2010s, international financial integration has consistently triggered and amplified shocks. Indeed, between 1945 and 1980 an average of one in a hundred countries worldwide experienced a banking crisis in any given year, while between 1980 and 2008 – a period in which international financial integration increased considerably – the equivalent figure was one in five.[3]  The second concern is about fairness – i.e. the question of whether all countries abide by the same rules and standards. This is evident at global level in relation to accusations of currency manipulation or dumping practices, or in fears of a “race to the bottom” in terms of environmental and social standards. Similar worries have emerged within Europe in relation to free movement of people and posted workers. The third concern relates to inequality. Many people believe that open markets have favoured capitalists and the rich at the expense of workers and the poor. Global value chains (i.e. supply chains spread across a number of countries) are thought to have reduced workers’ bargaining power. There is also empirical evidence that financial globalisation has been associated with increases in income inequality within individual countries.[4] OECD data show that the labour compensation of the bottom 99% of earners, measured as a fraction of national income, has declined over the last 20 years in rich countries, while the labour compensation of the top 1%, measured as a fraction of national income, has increased by 20%.[5] Likewise, global integration has made it easier for companies and individuals to avoid taxation by exploiting international loopholes. Corporate tax bases have been eroded owing to transfer prices within value chains, and tax competition between countries has led to a race to the bottom in terms of tax rates.[6] A debate is currently raging between economists as to whether all of the unequal gains resulting from international trade can be addressed using social transfers, or whether changes need to be made to the rules of the global game.[7] However, all would agree that the revenue which has been lost as a result of tax avoidance and tax optimisation would have helped governments to at least mitigate the adverse distributional effects of globalisation.[8]  Finally, the fourth concern is about democracy. Many people are concerned as to whether the open market is truly subject to democratic control. As international markets extend further beyond the borders of nation states, it becomes less clear who governs them. Some people fear that openness has resulted in elected authorities ceding sovereignty to international investors or multinational corporations – e.g. via investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms. International cooperation between elected governments has been rekindled following the global financial crisis (particularly in the context of the G20), but beyond efforts to tackle immediate crises, the effective remit of such cooperation has largely been confined to financial regulation (and, more recently, tax cooperation). Even in the presence of clear structures allowing democratic control (as in the case of the EU), some politicians have succeeded in suggesting that those structures are too remote from the lives of voters and successfully played on the idea of taking back control by promising to repatriate powers to the national level. Some of these concerns are based more on perception than on fact. For example, increased sensitivity to financial shocks and widening income gaps could be attributable to a number of other factors, including technological change,[9] and the two processes are increasingly interrelated.[10] Still, just as it is important not to overreact to criticism of globalisation, it is equally important to retain a sense of humility – to acknowledge that globalisation raises profound questions about fairness, stability, equity and democracy, which need to be properly debated and, where necessary, answered by means of effective public policies. Regaining sovereignty Some suggest that the solution is to withdraw within national borders. This option is destined to fail for two reasons. First, it deprives people of the economic advantages that trade and integration bring. According to one estimate, the EU’s GDP per capita would be as much as one-fifth lower if no integration had taken place since 1950.[11] More than 30 million jobs in the EU (i.e. a total of one in seven) are dependent on exports to the rest of the world.[12] Second, the act of renationalising policies will not allow a country to evade global competition: isolating itself from global value chains will raise input prices, make its exports less competitive and make the country less attractive to investors, ultimately weakening the economy on both the supply and the demand side. Similarly, retreating from international cooperation will not allow a country to escape tax competition and is likely to make it less effective at fighting tax evasion. History suggests that there is only one solution. Whenever globalisation has led to excesses and retreated into protectionism in the past, the lesson we have learned is that globalisation is not sustainable without strong institutions. The United Nations and its offspring (such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) were a direct response to the descent into protectionism that was observed during the interwar years. Similarly, the G5 was born of the 1970s oil crisis, while the G20 was born of the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s and was given a new role in safeguarding world trade and strengthening the global financial architecture in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. However, by far the most advanced and successful political construct in terms of managing globalisation has been the European Union. The EU’s founding fathers devised a means of collectively managing the challenges thrown up by open markets without retreating behind national borders. They gave its Member States a unique platform for recovering some of the state functions that had been eroded by globalisation. Rather than having to choose between openness and sovereignty, sharing sovereignty within European institutions has allowed countries to regain sovereignty.[13] In other words, the EU provides a regional answer to the “political trilemma” popularised by economist Dani Rodrik,[14] according to which it is not possible to pursue democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration at the same time. This is not to say that the EU is perfect. The multiple crises that it has faced in recent years highlighted many issues that need to be addressed in terms of its effectiveness and its legitimacy. However, the EU has sustained an open order across the European continent for over 60 years. Since 1960, cumulative growth in real GDP per capita has been one-third higher in western Europe than in the United States. Europe has also accumulated greater wealth as a percentage of annual income than the United States (more than 500%, compared with 400% on the other side of the Atlantic).[15] At the same time, it has also demonstrated greater awareness of sustainability concerns – e.g. through its leading role in brokering international agreements on climate change in the context of the UN, from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement. Thus, where pitfalls are encountered, we should not seek to unravel the EU and its many achievements, but strive to build better political institutions at European level that directly address the concerns of EU citizens and deliver the kind of managed globalisation that they desire, on the basis of the four considerations detailed above. Reconciling economic integration with fairness The EU has probably been most successful in its efforts to make economic integration fair – i.e. ensure that everyone abides by the same rules and standards. Here, the fundamental factor is the level playing field established by EU legislation and the EU institutions responsible for its enforcement, particularly the Court of Justice of the European Union. This provides the strongest possible assurance that fair competition and consumer protection will not be undermined by openness. Moreover, the obligation for companies to respect EU standards when exporting products to the EU, combined with the size of the European market (with the EU representing the number one trading partner of no fewer than 80 countries), mean that the EU tends to influence standards elsewhere – the so-called “Brussels Effect”.[16] Rather than allowing globalisation to become an inevitable race to the bottom, the EU can, with its regulatory power, actually trigger a global race to the top. This can only be good for globalisation in the long run. There has been growing criticism of the fairness of competition in relation to the free movement of labour. But here, too, the EU has established a framework – on which it can build further – aimed at reconciling mobility with fairness. Safeguards central to the European social model have progressively been embedded in European law, notably through the Charter of Fundamental Rights. And where there is more subtle undercutting of wages, the EU framework allows national authorities to set their own minimum wages and limits on working hours. Moreover, where there have been controversies (e.g. regarding posted workers), EU legislation has been amended following intense political debate. Fair trade in Europe has also been supported by the single currency, which has reinforced the framework governing fair competition by removing the possibility of repeated cycles of competitive devaluations of national currencies. This has eliminated fears of currency manipulation, reduced protectionist temptations and supported the Single Market. Now that devaluation is not an option, euro area countries have to address the real root causes of any competitiveness problems that they may suffer. This is sometimes seen as harsh medicine, since such adjustments may require a subtler form of devaluation through wage restraint. Many euro area countries adopted this approach in seeking to restore cost competitiveness following the global financial crisis, and most of those countries have now fully recovered. However, further thought could be given to the question of how European instruments could be developed in order to ensure that social safety nets prevent such adjustments from increasing poverty and undermining long-term growth. This will, contribute to support for the European project in countries undergoing such adjustments – particularly in the context of financial assistance programmes. Europe’s crisis-fighting toolbox is now greatly improved thanks to the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), but significant gaps remain in the absence of a grant instrument supporting social safety nets in programme countries or an option to redirect substantial funds from the EU budget. Protecting Europeans from instability When it comes to goods and services, the EU has contributed hugely to ensuring that economic integration is perceived as safe, and therefore sustainable. Regulatory convergence in product and services standards, coupled with a common approach for market surveillance, has underpinned trust in open markets within Europe, as has the ability of the EU to respond quickly to emerging threats to consumer protection. For example, the internal market for frozen foods was able to survive the mis-selling scandal of 2013, when horsemeat was sold as beef, in large part because it was met with an improved food labelling and EU-wide inspection regime that restored trust. By contrast, a perceived lack of regulatory convergence between the EU and third countries, especially regarding food safety, is one reason for opposition to preferential trade agreements, such as the TTIP. When it comes to finance, until recently, the EU had less to offer in terms of making integration stable. Indeed, we learned the hard way that an incomplete monetary union, as well as integrated capital markets without similarly integrated financial regulation and supervision, can create their own forms of instability. But Europe has made important progress in this area in recent years. It has established the ESM, which has a lending capacity of €500 billion – not far short of the IMF’s lending capacity for the whole world – and can come to the rescue when Member States face liquidity constraints. Equally far-reaching has been the decision to establish a banking union in order to mitigate the risk of systemic banking crises. 80% of all banking assets in the euro area are now supervised at European level, and there is a single mechanism for resolving failing banks. For the first time ever, we have genuinely supranational governance of the banking sector, based on a single rulebook. This ensures that there will be no regulatory race to the bottom. However, there is no room for complacency in this regard. Risks to financial stability, including new risks such as cybersecurity threats, require continuous attention. The process of establishing a capital markets union remains in its infancy and faces a number of daunting legal challenges, which will need to be overcome (e.g. as regards harmonising – if not unifying – national insolvency laws). Moreover, the banking union needs to be completed by ensuring that fully robust European lines of defence are put in place to protect taxpayers, customers and depositors. There are also discussions about giving the euro area a budgetary capacity, with varying views as to whether it should primarily act as a backstop and instrument for investment protection in times of crisis, focus on stabilising the business cycle or finance the provision of public goods on a permanent basis, as well as a debate regarding the appropriate way of ensuring democratic accountability. While it is important to get this right and ensure that it is accompanied by efforts to restore fiscal buffers at national level, progress towards more central fiscal stabilisation should not be deferred indefinitely.[17]  The robustness of our crisis resolution framework will not be truly tested until the next major crisis, but we have already seen encouraging signs in this regard. Europe’s financial system successfully weathered the turbulence that was observed in global financial markets in 2015 and early 2016, and the shock of the Brexit vote came and went without visible damage. More fundamentally, the path that Europe has embarked on represents the most advanced attempt yet to reconcile the benefits of cross-border financial integration – in terms of risk‑sharing and access to finance – with its potential pitfalls. Promoting equitable integration In the third area – making integration equitable – there has been less emphasis on policies at EU level thus far. To a large extent, this is because EU Member States already have the most comprehensive welfare systems in the world at national level. As Chancellor Merkel has often noted, Europe has 7% of the world’s population, 25% of its GDP and 50% of its welfare spending. Welfare systems need to be adjusted in many ways if they are to be financially sustainable, but they provide a strong basis for protecting people who lose out as a result of globalisation. Indeed, history shows that making globalisation sustainable has often depended on strengthening the welfare state. The erosion of the tax base and the shifting of corporate profits are severely challenging Member States’ ability to engineer redistribution, but the EU has considerable latent potential in this regard, because no large corporation – not even Apple – can threaten to completely turn its back on the world’s largest market. Indeed, the European Commission is already using competition tools to address possible tax arbitrage by multinational corporations, while the proposed Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has the capacity to eliminate opportunities for tax avoidance through profit shifting within Europe. In both areas, European institutions can establish leverage over large corporations in a way that individual countries cannot. A key issue for the EU as time goes by will be the extent to which its direct redistributional role should increase. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which was established in 2007, was set up in order to help workers and companies with the transition process, but its resources remain far too limited and its procedures too heavy. The European Social Fund has much greater resources at its disposal and has proved to be effective at helping people to get back into employment. There is an argument for expanding these two programmes further, both in scale and in scope.[18]  Ensuring democratic legitimacy In many ways, the EU gives its citizens more democratic control over globalisation than is afforded to people in other countries. Indeed, it is far more advanced than other trade areas in terms of its political structure: decisions affecting the EU as a whole are taken jointly by nationally elected representatives sitting together in the Council of the European Union and by the directly elected European Parliament. And through the powers it has over competition and financial regulation, the EU gives its citizens greater control over multinational companies and financial markets. A united Europe, speaking with one voice at global level, also helps to communicate European preferences on trade, as well as on financial, tax, social and environmental standards. However, governance and democratic legitimacy need to be strengthened further. For example, the ESM and decisions on financial assistance programmes are based on intergovernmental arrangements that fall outside the European Parliament’s accountability remit. This may give the impression that powers have been transferred to the European level, when in fact they continue to be exercised largely by Member States. Thus, intergovernmental institutions such as the ESM need, eventually, to be integrated into the EU’s treaties in order to improve both democratic control and the means and perception of joint ownership and decision-making. Otherwise, we risk a situation where common challenges are continually seen through a national lens, which inevitably fragments Europe’s democratic debate and fuels divisions that undermine efforts to implement effective European policies.[19]  All of this is made more challenging by the fact that there is not yet a meaningful European public space. And yet here, ironically, globalisation could actually come to the EU’s aid. The spread of digital technology, especially among younger people, could ultimately lead to a different, less nation-centric debate about the role of Europe. *** The EU’s challenge is to preserve social contracts within countries in the face of globalisation – which effectively requires a social contract across countries. This is what the EU provides at European level, through its legislative, executive and judicial powers. If those powers are well used, and if economic, social and legal frameworks are also improved at national level, the EU can make a decisive contribution to making globalisation sustainable, both in Europe and beyond. In so doing, the EU could also go a long way towards addressing its own challenges in terms of popular legitimacy. If it can better advertise its capacity to harness globalisation to the popular will, and if it can be reformed in order to achieve its full potential, there is no reason why some of the negative perceptions that surround the EU today cannot rapidly be dispelled. It is encouraging to see European leaders working to define a vision for further integration with a view to tackling common global challenges. Despite everything we hear from the various doomsayers and naysayers, this could be Europe’s moment. We need to seize this opportunity – and do it soon.      [1] Chopin, T. and Foucher M.

2018-03-16,Peter Praet,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi on 14 March 2018 and published on 16 March 2018","  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balazs Koranyi on 14 March 2018 and published on 16 March 2018  Mario Draghi took a cautious view on inflation, arguing that economic slack may be bigger than earlier thought. What is the implication of this unexpected slack?  The policies we have undertaken, especially since 2014, have been quite successful in getting us closer to our inflation aim. But there are uncertainties about the process of inflation, given factors like globalisation and technological changes. Mario Draghi raised important questions, which have been discussed among central bankers: what is the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), what is the output gap and how big is the slack? He was exploring the possibility that the degree of slack might be bigger than what you find in classical assessments.  We are continuously surprised by the response of the labour market to increasing aggregate demand of a growing economy because rising demand has been leading to continuous positive supply reactions in the labour market.  ECB staff estimates that the euro area output gap is closed, and there is already a positive output gap in Germany. But there is little inflation. Maybe there is another explanation. Perhaps we are getting a supply of labour that is pushing the frontier out. In Germany we know that migration from Central and Eastern European countries with relatively comparable skills is making an impact. Without such a labour supply reaction, you would have had wage inflation about 1 percentage point higher, and as a consequence, higher inflation.   Would that mean that the output gap is not yet closed?  That is an open question. We are all surprised by the reaction of the labour market to better economic conditions. The increasing participation of women and older people is certainly making an impact. In term of hours worked, we have not yet recovered the level of 2007. But in terms of employment, we have. It seems there is a trend for people to work less or part time.  Now we are reaching a floor for unemployment but it’s not so clear if we’re going to see wage increases and Mario Draghi was opening the conversation on the possibility that there may be more slack in the economy. That still needs to be confirmed but we already have strong evidence of a strong labour supply reaction. The survey of professional forecasters indicates that unemployment will fall to 7.5 percent in 5 years. It’s not clear if that’s the new NAIRU. Economists have been surprised by the fact that the NAIRU has been continuously revised downwards. The supply of labour has increased more than expected, so there were reservoirs of labour. It could be migration or longer working hours.  It is clear that if you believe that the degree of slack is higher, then the process of convergence to below, but close to, 2% over the medium term would be drawn out. We should not draw implications for policy immediately but it shows you the richness of the discussion at a stage where the economy is booming and we don’t see very strong wage increases and little pass through to prices.  However, we still see improvements in the path of inflation, so the bottom line is not bad at all. It means that the economy may have unexploited potential capacity.   If slack is bigger, wouldn’t it mean that the path would be shallower?  Well, other things being equal, it would be shallower.  Another explanation for low wage growth is that there is some backward looking behaviour in the wage-setting mechanism and in inflation expectations. For the time being I take an open view.  Monetary policy also plays a role. Our asset purchases programme has a minimum horizon of end September, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment in inflation. It is true that when we communicate about what happens beyond September, we want to have confirmation of data. Things are going in the right direction but there are a number of uncertainties. So the message is patience, persistence and prudence. When do you need to communicate what happens beyond September? It can’t be on the very last day, but I argue that it shouldn’t be too early, either. There are not too many Governing Council meetings between now and then.  Can you see a scenario that you use the June projections to set up the decision and then take the actual decision in July?  The projection exercise is always important. There are four per year and there will be one in June. It’s true that projections in general are useful to guide and structure the discussion. But I would caution against concluding that there is a pattern. We should not put too much weight on the projections.   You mentioned earlier that market expects the first rate hike between the first and second quarters of next year. How comfortable with those expectations?  The expectation implicit in the forward curve currently fluctuates around April and May. Market analysts’ surveys indicate expectations of a slightly delayed lift-off. I don’t want to directly answer this question. But we try to judge if market expectations reflect fundamentals and if market expectations fit with our views. It’s a two way street: we learn from markets and markets learn from us.  Markets have a certain expectation about the end of the net asset purchase programme (APP). We try to see if this fits with the narrowing between the inflation objective and market indicators of inflation expectations. For example, I look at the gap between the objective of below, but close to, 2% and the 5-year/5-year forward swaps-derived inflation rate, which is now at 1.7 percent. So the gap is narrowing, which is why markets don’t expect us to continue the APP much longer. Market prices seem to be coherent with the narrowing of the gap between market-based inflation expectations and our objective. It’s a good sign. There is a convergence between market expectations and our intended end date, with the optionality.  When approaching the end of our net asset purchases, our forward guidance on policy rates will have to be further specified and calibrated as appropriate to keep inflation on a sustained adjustment path towards our inflation objective.  So what happens afterwards?  Our resilience criterion for inflation is not always understood well. It means that for us to stop net asset purchases, we have to be sure that the financial conditions resulting from that announcement will not compromise the adjustment path of inflation.  This path is by itself conditional on easy financial conditions. And financial conditions are the result of three instruments: net purchases, re-investments and our forward guidance on the short-term policy rates. Today we say that our policy rates will stay at their present levels well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. This indication is an important conditioning variable – together with net purchases and re-investments – behind the convergence path that we project today. As we move forward in time, as is natural, the relative importance of the three policy tools will change, and the main tool for shaping the policy stance will become the path of our key interest rates and the forward guidance about their likely evolution.  Today, by and large, markets quantify the “well past” interval as ‘up to next spring’. But at some point that ‘well past’ indication will not be sufficient any longer to give the public enough information about the most likely outlook for our policy.  Once you stop net asset purchases the signaling aspect of the APP disappears and you therefore have to be much more precise about the future path of the short term rates. We will then have to re-specify our forward guidance on interest rates. Most likely, we will calibrate it as appropriate for inflation to remain on the sustained adjustment path to our inflation aim. So, as in the past, we will ensure that monetary policy controls the short end of the yield curve.  We will proceed at a gradual pace, or a measured pace as Mario Draghi said, in a way that is most appropriate for inflation convergence - taking into account continued uncertainty about the size of the output gap and the responsiveness of wages to slack. You said you would have a discussion about revising your guidance in early 2018. Should you revise the guidance at the same time as you decide what happens beyond September? Indeed, early this year, we have removed the easing bias on our APP. Looking forward, I wouldn't say there is a date or a deadline. The fact that the two of us are talking about this now is already very telling. However, I would not revise the guidance too early, because that could send wrong signals about the end of our net asset purchases, which in any case are intended to run until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.   When the first rate hike comes, will you only raise the deposit rate until the interest rate corridor is symmetrical again?   I think it is premature to discuss this question. What counts in the markets is the level and the expected path of the very short term rate at which banks borrow from each other. Because of sizeable excess liquidity expected to prevail over the coming years, the deposit facility rate is the policy rate that can steer those interbank conditions most effectively.  Benoît Cœuré argued that given your oversized balance sheet, you can retreat from asset buys without risking an unwarranted rise in term premia. Do you agree with this argument?  The float – the share of government bonds held by the private sector – has decreased with our purchases. The marginal intervention you have when the float is smaller has the potential to have some bigger effects on prices. But it is a relatively short term consideration. The main argument, and I think it is widely shared, is indeed that the stock becomes very important.  But we need to consider that, as the stock ages automatically, there is a ‘duration leak’, if you do nothing about reinvestments. That's where the reinvestment comes in. And we say we will reinvest for an extended period of time. It’s another element that in the future will have to be clarified. Obviously, reinvesting in short term debt has not the same impact on duration as investing in longer term debt. The Fed tries to be relatively market neutral. That’s something we may wish to clarify in the future.  Clearly, we will remain an important participant in the bond market. But we do not dominate the market. Markets will continue to play a very strong role. That means our actions are very much scrutinized.  The influence we have on market prices reflect the credibility of our policy, of the central bank and the inflation objective.   Is tapering at the end of the programme necessary?   Let me start with what I read from markets: markets expect us to avoid cliff effects. I think it is a good illustration of the interaction I mentioned before. It’s again a question about being coherent with what you say. When you say you have a policy of prudence, because of a number of uncertainties, what you will do at the end of the program must be coherent with that sort of communication. So people can judge what is coherent with a notion of prudence and could conclude that we will gradually bring net asset purchases to an end once the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment path. I think it is well understood by the market.   "
2018-03-14,Yves Mersch,Interview with Luxemburger Wort,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Pierre Sorlut and Barbara Tasch on 8 March and published on 14 March 2018","  Interview with Luxemburger Wort   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Pierre Sorlut and Barbara Tasch on 8 March and published on 14 March 2018  Mr Mersch, the Governing Council has not yet decided to raise the interest rate. When that happens, the debt-to-service ratio will increase and put pressure on households who took out loans to buy their houses. How big is the danger?  Let me say first that the bigger the imbalances, the less the economy is prepared for a monetary policy change. Any change in the monetary policy stance is always a shock to the economy, positive or negative. It's not in our mandate to consider the households of any particular country when we change the monetary policy stance. That includes Luxembourg. We set interest rates for the euro area as a whole. We are not yet ready at this stage to change interest rates. We first take the non-conventional measures towards the exit. Only then will we consider the conventional ones. Today, at our press conference, we confirmed that we're confident with the path which is leading to our objective. The primary objective is price stability, which we have defined as an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% in the medium term.  Second, on some banks’ balance sheets, loans to the private sector are very substantial and in some there is a high concentration of mortgages. In Luxembourg there are one or two institutions that rank among those with the highest exposure to mortgages in Europe. If a shock affects this cluster of assets, then they are at risk. Household indebtedness in Luxembourg is higher than in other countries – however the wealth of these households is also higher than in other countries, and disparities between the holders of assets and liabilities also have to be considered. What is specific to Luxembourg is that the price pressure on the housing market is growing faster than in many other countries. We’re speaking of a 7% increase while the economy is growing at only half that rate. We’re speaking of a more than 50% increase in house prices over the last eight or nine years. This is mostly explained by the insufficient supply and by the strong demand resulting from labour inflows. This also results in wealth per capita in Luxembourg not growing. In turn, that creates the impression that wealth is not being fairly distributed. To sum up, Luxembourg is not running into a wall but risks are clearly there and actions have to be taken, as recommended by international and domestic institutions.   What actions?  That’s up to the national authorities. It’s not a matter of monetary policy. Monetary policy is a blunt weapon. But those best equipped to deal with the situation are the national authorities, as they are the closest. This is why macroprudential policy, as it is called, is in the hands of the national authorities.  What would be the room for manoeuvre?  There are tools which are aimed at the borrower or the lender. You have debt-to-income ratios, loan-to-value ratios, etc. There are also tax measures. If, on the one hand, you support lending by reducing taxation, it makes no sense to tighten lending with macroprudential tools on the other. One has to be consistent. Being consistent is the first rule of governance. If monetary policy is loose, as it is now, and on top you also have loose fiscal policy, and on the supervisory side you deregulate or have very lax supervision, then you're asking for trouble. That's exactly what caused the last financial crisis: the combination of loose fiscal policy, accommodative monetary policy and lax supervision.   How exactly does the ECB assess the risk of Brexit?  First, we need to know what the UK is requesting. Second, we need to know what is happening during the transition period – if there is one. If there is no deal and there is a hard Brexit, this will harm both sides. There will be a need for some legal clarity. For instance, will contracts still be valid and, if so, how could they be implemented? The private sector solutions could be extremely difficult and cumbersome. But there could also be a need for a public sector response, e.g. some recognition or grandfathering of existing contracts. When do you start this grandfathering? At the moment they declare Brexit or at the moment you start the transition? This is all unclear. I can't give you all the answers, but neither am I one of those who believe that the EU will go under without London.  How would you define your cooperation with the Luxembourg regulator?  I consider that the central bank side is working better because it is constructed differently. We are a Eurosystem, while supervision is not. For the supervisors there are still a lot of national regulations to respect. If a supranational body like the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) were to use only European law, things would be clear. That would be our preference. But in supervision sometimes national law prevails and there is still a lot of divergence between national laws that the single supervisor has to respect.   How would you centralise the whole thing?  Different agencies exist, such as the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). But they only have what is essentially a coordination role at the moment. The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) at the ECB has the effective supervisory function for banking. For all the agencies, there are proposals for improvement on the table. For securities markets, another important piece of draft regulation is the European Market Infrastructure Regulation 2 (EMIR2). If we have to contact 25 different regulators or supervisors in order to get a picture of who and what in the single market is allowed and under what conditions, it would be extremely cumbersome. From that point of view, we welcome an increase in efficiency at European level. We consider the completion of the banking union important for the single market and the single currency, in other words, one market, one banking supervisor and one security supervisor in the medium term. That should be accompanied by one deposit insurance system as well. But I understand those who say, “Let's first clean up all the remaining negative elements from the past before we accept a sharing of responsibility at European level. That is exactly what we are doing now by pushing for the resolution of non-performing loans. We’re trying to put supervisory standards on the same level. It is not enough to assign only the responsibility to the European level, we also need a level playing field in terms of the tools and their implementation.   The Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier[1] (CSSF) has recently expressed its concern about its sanctioning powers. What do you think of Director General Claude Marx's statement?  I don’t know this statement. According to European law, the authority for criminal cases is still a national affair. When it comes to administrative sanctioning, that's another issue. Some propose setting up a sanctioning authority that does nothing but sanctioning. I don't know, and I do not have to know, national initiatives in a national context in this respect. On the central bank side we have sanctions at national but also at European level.   You're referring to the case of the Latvian bank ABLV...  The Latvian subsidiary. I read in the media that the supervisory side of the ECB informed the national authorities of what happened and suggested to them to use the tools they have at their disposal. Since the way the national tools were used is now the subject of a court case, I cannot comment further on it. Let the court decide. The national central bank for its part took its own measures. And they suspended the bank. The ECB did not suspend the whole group [from monetary policy operations] until later. The Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) suspended the group before the ECB because they have the possibility to do so at national level.   Would you have another example?  There are some investment funds which ought to provide information and statistics to the national central bank, which then reports to us. But some funds don't do it. We have asked the BCL several times to initiate sanctions because we consider that the local authority has clear knowledge of the matter. I think they are now ready to do it. I would not say centralisation is better per se. Sometimes proximity leads to higher efficiency.   Another topic which is concerning the ECB and national lawmakers is virtual currencies. Luxembourg and other countries in the EU are granting more and more importance to virtual currencies, but you seem to be really cautious. What do you see as the biggest potential threats emanating from cryptocurrencies?  One should consider various aspects. One is financial stability, the second is consumer protection, the third is investor protection, the fourth is market integrity and the fifth is anti-money laundering. Concerns regarding these aspects are especially high in relation to what you call cryptocurrencies. I call them virtual tokens, by the way. They are like the tokens you buy when you go to a casino. Studies have shown that 50% of transactions made using these virtual tokens and 25% of users are linked to illicit activities. There are four main risks. The first risk is market liquidity. The market is excessively concentrated, with about 96% of transactions being carried out by 2% of account holders. Second is liquidity risk. These currencies still always need transferring to the real economy because your bakery will not accept them. There were conferences on bitcoins where they said you could pay with bitcoin. But when you tried to pay the entrance fee with bitcoin, it took so long that the conference was over by the time the payment was received. It is not an efficient system.  The third risk is that people use cryptocurrencies to create leverage because they don't get leverage any more in the real economy. For example, consumers could use their credit cards to make such investments and increase their indebtedness. The higher the leverage, the greater the risk as well.  The fourth risk is the operational and technical immaturity of the technology. We are open to the technology of distributed ledgers. But that is something different from bitcoin. Bitcoin itself belongs to no one; no one is backing it, no one is issuing it. The mining is happening to a large extent in remote places and involves very high energy consumption. Bitcoin’s estimated annual energy consumption has now reached more than 52 terawatt hours per year, which is more than the total energy consumption of Portugal. We see that, for example, when approval is sought, it sometimes takes several hours to get one block validated. The ECB, by contrast, is about to offer instant payments in all European countries. An instant payment costs 0.2 cent and the recipient has it within 10 seconds. This is efficient and pan-European, and it is also operated by trusted authorities as well as regulated and supervised entities. Then you have contagion channels for the risks of virtual currencies. If households are heavily involved in bitcoin and the whole thing collapses, it could create a wealth effect on the economy, depending of course on the scale of the market. With official currencies, you have central banks, like the ECB, you have governments who put political capital into maintaining a currency and supporting it. But if people do not distinguish between the two things – and this is why I don’t like the word “currency” for these schemes – it would undermine confidence in the official currency. And some of those who promote these new schemes want a currency which is not controlled by a government. So it’s a slightly sympathetic anarchic or libertarian approach, but unfortunately there is no libertarian law enforcement and there is no libertarian world government.  You said in London last month that virtual currencies were not real money and that they wouldn’t be for the foreseeable future. So what would have to change for them to be considered money, what would need to be implemented?  Without a trusted authority backing the stability of a so-called currency, an institution whose primary objective is to do just that, you don’t have a currency. A currency has three functions: a unit of account, a store of value and a medium of exchange. These tokens don’t fulfil any of the three functions, as I said in London.   There is another sector growing without proper authority, and that’s shadow banking. A recent study has shown that it’s growing, and that the Luxembourg market – which is for the first time included in the study – could represent 7.2% of all shadow banking. How would you judge whether activities like securitisation represent a threat to financial stability?  Let me first say that you cannot call everything that is not a bank a shadow bank. Banking by definition means that you give credit and you take deposits. Indeed, many of these institutions don’t do that. But on the other hand it is certainly true that some vehicles have been created to remove risk from banks and thus reduce their regulatory capital requirements, with such vehicles being used in order to escape supervision. That is what we cannot accept any more. We cannot afford another crisis of the magnitude we had.  How would you manage that risk?  We need to be determined and implement the rules that were agreed at the Pittsburgh G20 summit. But not everything is shadow banking. For example, the World Bank – and above all its sister organisation the International Finance Corporation (IFC) – is doing a lot of financing through Luxembourg. All the international development banks are issuing through Luxembourg because of its efficient legislation. Many corporations which operate worldwide cannot raise funds in each country; it’s more efficient to bundle them. I would say that this is efficient international finance, not shadow banking, and it does not create additional risk for the customer but rather lowers the cost of funding.  Another topic for discussion is money market funds, which to some extent can have leverage and so are much closer to being like a bank. And that is also the reason why money market funds are obliged to report to the ECB. Then you have investment funds from entities like investment banks, private equity and other alternative investment funds (AIFs). Don’t forget that Lehman Brothers was not a bank in Luxembourg, but they sold their products to most banks at that time. So these are areas where we have to see whether what’s involved is not in fact a bank-like activity. And if it is, then it should also be subject to the same regulations as a bank, because otherwise we don’t have a level playing field. The objective is to de-risk the financial world and prevent the kind of risk accumulation that led to the crisis. We should regulate risk rather than entities according to their legal definition.  How much of a risk are the Italian election results to financial stability in Europe?  Italy is the third largest economy in the euro area. Italy has shown a certain amount of institutional resilience in the past, and of course the elections have been a lesson to the established parties. I hope that resilience will come into play in the coming weeks and months.   And then on the other side of the Atlantic, President Trump has just announced an increase in tariffs on steel and aluminium, which could start a trade conflict with Europe. How much does the ECB worry about that?  Obviously, conflicts are not conducive to economic growth, but let’s take things step by step. As the President of the ECB said at our recent press conference, they can affect the confidence channel. This is because confidence is so important, even at this stage of the economy’s expansion.  Some forecasts have shown a slight slowdown in growth in the euro area. How could that become a problem for the inflation target?  Less than six months ago, some said that inflation would be below 1% in February or March, and growth forecasts were less than half of what they are now. All the indicators point to economic growth in Europe continuing, because, for example, both capacity utilisation and labour utilisation point to a continued need for further investment and capacity extension. Supply-side expansion is increasing potential growth and allowing for more labour utilisation and higher incomes.  To conclude on a more personal note, what are your plans for December 2020?  I couldn’t even tell you where I will be spending Christmas 2020, and I have not given it any thought. Indeed, I still enjoy my work. But the older you get, the more you are unable to make plans which are 50 years ahead.

2018-03-13,Benoît Cœuré,Bitcoin not the answer to a cashless society,"Opinion piece by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Chair of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), co-authored by Jacqueline Loh, chair of the BIS Markets Committee, published in the Financial Times on 13 March 2018","  Bitcoin not the answer to a cashless society   Opinion piece by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Chair of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), co-authored by Jacqueline Loh, chair of the BIS Markets Committee, published in the Financial Times on 13 March 2018 Next week, Group of 20 policymakers will discuss bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital tokens. Such cryptocurrencies are poor imitations of money. Almost nobody prices goods in bitcoin, few use them for payments, and, as a store of value, they are no better than gambling in a casino. Policymakers are rightly worried about consumer and investor abuses, as well as illicit use. Yet, while bitcoin and its cousins are something of a mirage, they might be an early sign of change, just as Palm Pilots paved the way for today’s smartphones. Cash will not be king forever, even though it still rules in many parts of the world. New research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows non-cash payments have roughly doubled in size, as a share of GDP, since the turn of the century. Some Nordic countries are already cutting back on cash. And the iGeneration is more likely to reach for a payment app than a purse. To their children, banknotes and coins may look like museum exhibits.  These trends have sparked a discussion about whether central banks should issue their own digital coinage. A new report on central bank digital currencies (CBDC), released today by the two committees we chair at the BIS, sets the scene for this important debate. What is a CBDC? The answer goes to the heart of money and payments. Today, banknotes and coins are the only way consumers can access central bank money. The money in your bank account is actually provided by a commercial bank. Your bank promises to exchange that money for cash when you go to the ATM. But when you pay bills online or swipe your credit card, you are using commercial bank money.  Under the current system, only financial institutions have direct access to digital central bank money via accounts at their national central bank. A consumer-oriented CBDC would extend that access to everyone. Although this might not seem like a big step to digitally-savvy consumers, it could have far-reaching ramifications for the role of money, the financial system and the economy.  For example, a CBDC for all would challenge the current model of banks taking customer deposits and using that money to fund the lending that helps drive the economy. The consequences for bank business models and financial stability would need to be carefully parsed.  More fundamentally, do we need a CBDC? Existing payment arrangements – based on commercial money – are already digitally provided and increasingly convenient, instantaneous and available 24/7. Nevertheless, if cash disappeared, there would be a stronger case to consider a CBDC. Otherwise, the public would be wholly dependent on commercial money, and trust in the currency, a key public good, would be reliant on the creditworthiness of commercial entities and on specific payment technologies. However, despite the growing popularity of electronic payments, the cashless society is not here yet. Demand for banknotes is still growing in many countries. If it were to come, a CBDC would have to be as convenient for consumers and businesses to use as the commercial equivalent. It would have to be hacker-proof. If we want to stop illegal use, it should not grant the same anonymity of cash to users. But giving central banks unprecedented amounts of information about individuals is equally controversial. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. In sum, thinking carefully about the future of money is timely in view of new technologies and increasing use of electronic payments. Still, it is not yet clear whether CBDCs for consumers and businesses are necessary or desirable. In other words, the jury is still out, and the answer will clearly differ country by country.  Away from the public eye, change may also be happening and perhaps sooner. The BIS report canvasses a second, complementary, model of CBDCs aimed at financial institutions that would build on the blockchain technologies underlying bitcoin. Such tokenised forms of digital central bank money could potentially help streamline many of the cumbersome clearing and settlement processes that are currently needed to complete securities and foreign exchange trades. So far, however, central bank experiments with such forms of CBDCs have not shown conclusive benefits for wholesale payments and beyond, but technology and design are evolving quickly. Despite its many faults, bitcoin has put the spotlight on an old failing of our current system: cross-border retail payments. Such payments not only permit shoppers to easily buy goods online from overseas, but also allow foreign workers to send money home, supporting financial inclusion and development. However, these payment channels are generally much slower, less transparent and way more expensive than domestic ones. Improvements here are the best way of rising to the bitcoin challenge.   "
2018-03-12,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with BFM Business TV,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stéphane Soumier on 12 March 2018","  Interview with BFM Business TV   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stéphane Soumier on 12 March 2018  Mario Draghi talks about growth and he says that it is “strong and broad”. And yet, the European Central Bank remains infinitely prudent. Is growth in Europe as strong and broad as all that?  It is strong, broad-based and inclusive, i.e. for the first time in a long time the whole of the euro area is growing – all regions, all industrial sectors, and this is a new development, and very positive. But, I should say first that inflation is not yet quite where we want it to be; the ECB’s projections put inflation at 1.4% for next year, which is good, but not close enough to 2%. So we are not yet quite where we would like to be in terms of inflation. Second, the international risks are significant, no doubt we’ll talk about them in a moment. And third, this growth still depends greatly, I would even say too much, on monetary policy. According to the ECB’s econometric models, with a growth rate of around 2.5% in the euro area, 0.5%, half a percentage point, is dependent on monetary policy. In other words, had it not been for all the ECB’s measures, growth would not be 2.5% in the euro area, it would be 2%. And inflation would also be half a point weaker.  Still, it’s not as strong as that. In any case, the euro area still isn’t able to progress at that pace by itself today...  It is too early to declare victory. We are going in the right direction and the decision taken by the ECB’s Governing Council last week, which entails changing our communication very slightly to show that we no longer intend to increase the scale of the central bank’s monthly asset purchases, represents a small communication step which shows our confidence. So confidence is growing but we cannot yet declare victory.  Nevertheless the market is expecting the asset purchase programme to come to an end, in September, December. What do you say to that? Is it still too early to say?  No, the end is inevitable. We have always said that quantitative easing would not last forever. We have not yet discussed the when and how of its termination. But it’s understood, of course, that this is the direction in which things are going. What has not been discussed by the Governing Council, however, is an increase in interest rates. It is very clear to us that short-term interest rates those the ECB controls, will remain at very low levels, well beyond the horizon of our asset purchases.  In other words, when Reuters says that the teams at the European Central Bank presented to the Governing Council a scenario envisaging an increase in the rates in mid-2019, it’s a scenario that you are telling us you are ruling out?   This is what the markets are forecasting; the ECB’s teams have Bloomberg screens like everybody else. But the Governing Council has never discussed this.  Bloomberg or Reuters screens … Let’s respect the competition! Anyway, I’m looking at the very latest indicators on our economic activity. Manufacturing in January was clearly declining in France, two months of slight pressure in Germany, with the mid-February PMI data also falling back a bit. Aren’t we levelling off now? We have finished accelerating and in fact the risk is that growth will fall back…  No, I don’t think that it’s worth being frightened by a few indicators. Growth is strong. There is a kind of stabilisation of the growth rate, when we talk about what’s called the “second derivative” rather than growth itself. Maybe there’s a stabilisation. In a way, that strengthens the belief that there have to be structural measures which will take over from monetary policy. Of course, that is the only possible direction.   You have described your policy as “giving time” to all the governments to attempt reforms. Has France now taken the right road, the right direction?   Yes, but it’s not the job of the ECB to give lessons to or to go into detail about what this or that government must do, because we don’t do politics, that’s not for us. We have a mandate which is very simple, which is to bring inflation in the euro area back towards 2%. And we’re making very good progress towards that, but we’re not quite there yet. Then, growth drivers are needed, growth in investment, in consumption, to take over from monetary policy. For that to happen, economies have to perform better. What we see in France is in fact going in that direction. There is a reform momentum which I think has two dividends: one for the French economy itself and one for the euro area. France is a very large country, the second-largest country in the euro area. The euro area needs reforms and having a strong French economy is also something that can set off a series of dialogues, a series of reforms right across the euro area.   France is now taking the path of that reform momentum and growth momentum?  Yes, but I don’t want to judge the ways and means of the French government, or the sequence of reforms.  No, but as for the priorities set, labour law, public sector, then pensions, is it roughly what you recommend?  Labour law, the functioning of the labour market, of course, including training, which is essential. In that respect, the good news is that the government is vigorously tackling the reform of vocational training. This is just as important, if not more so, than the flexibility of the labour market and labour costs. For a very long time, emphasis was placed on the cost of labour in France. I don’t think now that the cost of labour is a major obstacle compared with Germany, compared with France’s competitors. However, we do have a training problem which shows up in all the international surveys, and it is increasingly the priority. And the government is working on it.  There’s been talk of a “budgetary jackpot” this weekend, how do you regard that? What are your comments?  It’s a slightly ridiculous discussion; I spent 15 years at the Ministry of Finance in a previous life. Whenever France’s deficit goes below 3%, there are some good souls who speak of a jackpot. If you listen to them, it means that 3% will not be the upper limit of the deficit in France, it will be the lower limit; it means that the deficit will never go below 3%. Government debt is 97% of GDP. If our deficit remains at 3%, it is clear that we are heading towards serious debt sustainability problems. So we shouldn’t listen to those good people who think that there is a jackpot when the deficit is a fraction below 3%. It is a bit like giving an alcoholic sweet to a former alcoholic, so to speak, it seems to me a little dangerous.  And particularly because – and this is a centrepiece of your policy and I think it is the main difficulty you face – the northern European countries, a number of countries there, have been quite clear about the vague attempts at euro area reform put forward by Emmanuel Macron. Why not, but first of all your public finances have to be balanced?  Not only public finances. Growth in France must become strong again, structural unemployment must fall and public finances must be rebalanced. This is what our partners expect, and they’re right, it’s in our interest.  And so there can be no far-reaching reform of the euro area as long as France has these imbalances in its public finances?  This has long been the case. The lack of reforms or their hesitant nature in France has long been an obstacle to the reform of the euro area. And French politicians are partly responsible. This obstacle is being removed as there is a reform momentum and a downward dynamic in the deficit. And therefore, the barriers are now increasingly in the euro area and take the form of a state of mind which keeps on wanting to set the north and south of the euro area against each other. There is a form of political fragmentation of the euro area which persists, even as the economic fragmentation is declining. It’s in the heads of euro area politicians who tend to regard themselves as being from the north, the south, although these distinctions make no sense in that we are all in the same boat.  But how come it doesn’t make sense? These distinctions are real. Austerity is in the north now; it’s much weaker in the south. It is a reality and moreover you can see it in the data.  No, I don’t agree with you. Consider how Spain, a southern country, has reformed its labour market.  The north believes that if the south is pulling through now, it's because of the efforts the north has made, and it is having a training effect...   Say that to Spanish, Portuguese and Greek workers and employees. Tell them that if they are pulling through it’s thanks to the efforts of the north. It’s thanks to their own efforts, which were very difficult. So there has been a reform movement that in some instances has not been completed, but which has been very painful for the countries of southern Europe, in the countries that were in crisis, and now we have to go beyond that, to turn that page, to look to the future and rebuild how the euro area functions. And to do that, we have to leave the north-south differences behind us.  That means that, in the end, the only two problems remaining in the euro area today are France and Italy…  I don’t think that either France or Italy pose problems. France is doing what it has to do and the French president is instilling a reform dynamic in the euro area. To that end, it won't be Germany and France alone that are going to do it, so we also have to listen to what the Dutch, the Finns and the Irish have to say. We have to listen to them, and we will do. But France has triggered this reform momentum and we should be grateful to it for that. As for Italy, the election took place very recently. There are political discussions going on right now, and it’s not for me to comment on political discussions...  No, but could this instability slow down the normalisation of monetary policy that you want to implement?  No, we conduct monetary policy for the euro area, not for a particular country.  As for the Trump risk now, because it is like a new risk, and it was Mario Draghi who talked about it like that, we saw this weekend that Europe as a whole, the euro area, and Germany in particular, was the first target of the trade war that Donald Trump wants to unleash, how do you view that?  That’s the major risk today, it’s true. We hope that it won’t happen. But you have to look beyond the aggressive vocabulary, beyond the bluster, and ask what is the risk of a trade war? It is a loss of purchasing power for employees, workers, starting with those in the country that implements customs duties. The first to suffer will be American workers, it’s they who will lose their jobs. And possibly in the rest of the world, depending on how Europe, Japan, China react. So it is potentially a negative shock for the global economy.  One gets the feeling that Donald Trump is trying to test our unity. Do you have that impression too? He has been attacking Germany, German cars...  I’m not going to venture to interpret what the President of the United States says...  But we do need to try to find out what it means, what the impact might be…   It’s sometimes difficult, but it’s true that this is an opportunity for Europe to demonstrate its unity. I believe that this episode, like earlier episodes involving President Trump, reminds Eurosceptics that Europe remains our best tool, our best form of defence, in a global economy which is fraught with risk and danger. There are many ways in which Europe does not function well, and there is a need for reform, for change. There are things that need to be radically reformed, but Europe is the main weapon we have in this global landscape that is very dangerous, so it needs to be preserved.  So we need to confront Donald Trump directly with all the forces we can mobilise.  We should stay away from the language of war; it’s not about confrontation. We’re not confronting the American people, or the US economy. We’re protecting a modus operandi for the global economy that needs to be fair and balanced. And this fair and balanced modus operandi is currently under threat, so we need to defend it.  Mario Draghi has said that if you impose tariffs on your allies, one may wonder who your enemies are. There should be less escalation in the vocabulary used with Donald Trump because we don’t know where that might lead...  The United States is our ally.  Would a minister of finance for the euro area be a strong symbol and is that something you would call for?  Yes, it’s a strong symbol. Personally, I’m in favour of it. This is an idea that was put forward by Jean-Claude Trichet in his speech in Aachen a few years ago, when he was awarded the Charlemagne Prize. It would be a useful symbol provided it isn’t an empty symbol. So, when the heads of state and government of the euro area meet in June this year to find ways of giving new momentum to the euro area, if the extent of the reforms is to make marginal changes to the European Stability Mechanism and to give a position a new name, that won’t achieve much. It would be a useful symbol as long as the reality involves better coordination and more effective instruments to protect the euro area.  So it’s too early to talk about this at the moment? It needs to be the culmination of a process.  It is the culmination of a process. You know, with the German government formally being set up this week, the discussion has only just begun. We mustn’t be too impatient.  Do you have the feeling that the European Central Bank has saved the euro since 2012?  The European Central Bank has done everything it could within its narrowly defined mandate. And within that mandate, it has ensured the functioning of the euro area, it has dealt with speculation, it has provided a boost that has allowed growth to pick up again and inflation to move closer to 2%. And we did this when we could, within the mandate that we have been given by the people of Europe.  Ultimately, though, the primary mandate of a central bank – and this perhaps has been forgotten – is to defend the currency that it issues. Without the euro, there is quite simply no longer any reason for it to exist, and everything that implies.  The Governing Council did what it did without hesitation and almost unanimously, but as has often been said, we don’t know what the next crisis will look like. Will we be able to do the same thing when there is another crisis, which may beeven more severe, or very different in nature? I don't know. But the euro area needs to give itself the means to be more robust, to respond to crises separately from, and in addition to, anything the central bank might do. This is essential for the future. There is no guarantee that we will again be able to do what we did in 2012. We will try to do so again, of course, but each crisis is different, so the euro area needs to make itself stronger.   In that context, you know that there is an ongoing debate which must seem unreal to you but is real nonetheless regarding the nationality of the person who will succeed Mario Draghi. This demonstrates that European unity is failing somehow if all anyone is talking about is the nationality of Mario Draghi’s successor.  Yes, you are completely right, this debate is symptomatic of an approach in the euro area that is too often overly nationalistic, with everyone wanting to benefit from their membership of the euro, when it is in fact a shared project. This is a discussion which per se holds no great interest. The President should be chosen on the basis of his or her merits, of course. But it reflects attitudes from the past. And it’s exactly what we need to leave behind now.   "
2018-02-08,Yves Mersch,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Piotr Skolimowski and Carolynn Look on 6 February 2018","  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Piotr Skolimowski and Carolynn Look on 6 February 2018  BIS General Manager Augustine Carstens said in his speech in Frankfurt the other day that there is a “strong case” for authorities to rein in digital currencies because of their links to the established financial system. How would you respond?  The General Manager of the BIS is usually also reflecting the views that are expressed around the table when central bankers come together. You won't be surprised to know that we at the ECB are fully in line with his views and we have similar worries, or similar endeavours we are working on. The question is not so much that these virtual currencies (VCs) are already at a level that would cause huge disruption in the real economy, but we are currently more concerned about the social and psychological effect they seem to have. In this respect money has to do with confidence and that's why we, central bankers, feel that we have a certain role to play to preserve confidence of the public in our legal tender. There is so much money flowing in that it's like a gold rush - but there is no gold.  What specific role can the ECB as a banking supervisor play in reining in digital currencies?   It's important to stress that we are a supervisor and not regulator. But supervisors can also impose certain requirements in terms of risk mitigation and prudent behaviour. But by and large, many banks out of their own initiative have already taken clear positions that they will not venture into this gold rush. But that being said, it's not only the question of the bank supervisor. Also from the monetary policy perspective, the central bank has a mandate to promote sound and efficient payment systems. From that point of view, it remains appropriate that we keep a clear distinction between virtual private initiatives, not backed by anyone, and trusted public currencies that are legal tender and backed by whole economies.  Are you coordinating your efforts with other authorities?  We are obviously in a constant dialogue with other authorities, whose mandate is to maintain the integrity of the markets, protection of investors and of consumers. Therefore we should have a deeper reflection on where the action is needed. There is an area of investor protection, then there is oversight of the financial market infrastructure. If you increasingly have bridges between the virtual world and the real world and then there is a collapse in this virtual world, it could drain liquidity from the real world. This then becomes a concern for the central bank. Take the example of CCPs: if one were to offer future contracts on such VCs these would then have to be cleared. But CCPs have a single fund of default and if that fund were not sufficient then that would engage the responsibility of other clearers. That would mutualize risks that are emanating from those virtual currencies. The question then arises whether we shouldn't have a clearer segregation between the real and the virtual world. The same goes for the imported credit risk that could come along and the question of collateral. These are the areas where we have direct responsibility as a central bank. What is relevant to us is that we protect the functioning of our open market economy. At the same time, if someone wants to play Casino, let him do it, but then we shouldn't mutualize losses with the rest of the society.  What tools do you have to keep this virtual world at bay and do they need reinforcement?  Our existing frameworks for monetary policy clearly don’t accept these assets as collateral and we will also not accept them to enter our existing platforms like Target-2 - these rules are already in place. The question is: should we go beyond? If banks were to start leveraging, i.e. giving loans to finance such activities, then it would obviously be of concern for us, not only from the point of view of the risk management as a supervisor, but also in the view of our role to support financial stability and in view of our functioning, because we conduct monetary policy through banking system so we need a sound banking system. Would it help if also in the market infrastructure we would have the obligation to segregate accounts or to have higher capital retention? Those ideas are typical tools that are at disposal of either the central bank or the supervisor or macroprudential authorities and we might have to take a look whether they are also applicable to those virtual currencies and whether the time has come to go that way. But since some of those VCs have no national base, but rather define themselves as being globalized it would be best to have a globalized response and that's why the G20 is looking into the matter.  In what areas do you foresee the need for more forceful global response?  Since I have heard from different locations of similar concerns, we are all working at home, looking at what could be done. But it's at a very premature stage because we don't want to overdo it. We are in an open society, where people are free to lose money as they like.  It's a phenomenon that affects central banking, payment systems, banks and financial market infrastructure. By definition those activities become cross-border so a cross-border response is always preferable to a fragmented national one. In many jurisdictions there is a very high concern about money-laundering and terrorism financing. What needs to be decided here as a super-priority has to do with the level of political responsibility rather than the level of individual agencies. Therefore the G20 where you also have the government side coming is a welcome forum. The second in the list of priorities is to have more information because it's very difficult to have access to what is happening and where it's happening. We need more information and that's why for me one obligation would already be to force the unregulated platforms to report transactions in a harmonized way to repositories so that we would have access to information also in order to create a better response. I hear often that there are concerns of criminal activity and the amount of hoaxes in this virtual world is rather high. So the main concern is the absence of proper information and the absence of traces so you could track the transactions. So this is certainly something that specialized staff in different member states will also look into.  Your colleague Benoit Coeuré said recently that the ECB expects G-20 meeting in March to focus on coordinated response to the growth of digital currencies and urged leaders to come up with a regulatory answer. What are you expectations about this meeting in Buenos Aires?  You should not think of a meeting as being a switch. It will launch a certain amount of studies, it will probably task a certain number of existing institutions to dig deeper and then we will start the work. But in the meantime we already prepare in-house. Whatever happens, we want to be prepared.  What can you do until this coordinated response is ready?   We have on the one hand our existing toolbox. It always is useful if you look at the toolbox again in terms of what is possible from the point of view of a new application. Then you can see that a lot can be done already. Some measures might also be taken without huge or difficult legal changes.  Could you give us an example?  Our collateral framework, our platform where we are an operator, we have our payment systems, we are in the midst of discussing European framework for CCPs — these are all areas where there is still time and where a certain amount of legislation is still under review, so we could add it.  Would you be ready to abandon your TIPS initiative in favor of a blockchain/DLT based solution? The conclusion to your Stella project with BOJ says “DLT-based solution could meet the performance needs of current large value payment systems”?  TIPS is 10 seconds, 0.2 cents. DLT transactions are at best 30 euros and take at least one hour. Why would we abandon TIPS? We have a mandate for efficient payment systems, and we go for efficiency. We are not bound to a technology, we are bound to results, and I think it’s the result that counts.  As to the technology of DLT, we are testing it but there are so many unsolved questions in terms of governance and legal certainty in DLT. We are looking to what extent we could overcome these legal barriers, but we are at a very early stage.  There seems to be a certain change of tone in how you and your colleagues now speak about digital currencies. In the past some of your colleagues largely dismissed it as, for example, Tulip mania with no immediate consequences for the central bank. What prompted this bigger sense of urgency that something needs to be done right now?   As long as it was negligible it was not considered a priority, but since this hype accelerated at the end of last year it has moved higher up on the agenda. If you see how fast something can develop, it can very quickly reach dimensions of past bubbles that also had negative effects on the economy. That we cannot ignore. The valuations are not at a level where you would now jump from your chair and say “you need to forbid this thing”. We are not there. But what I do not like is the public hype driving this thing. Also the amount in ICOs is rather small. But this is market integrity, this is protecting the consumer. Here you can't say it's also affecting monetary policy. One thing to remember is also that we target asset bubbles if they are a risk for financial stability, and are debt-financed.  If we could fast-forward a bit --- can you imagine a situation where there is going to be one day a digital euro? Do you completely rule out such development -- a digital fiat currency?  I'm not a science fiction writer so in my official imagination I would restrain myself at best to look at certain circumstances if citizens were to desert cash, which is not the case right now. I could imagine a digital representation of cash, meaning a digital issuance that would replicate the features of cash, not a new digital currency disrupting bank intermediation, in order not to rock the boat of our whole economy and put into question the functioning of a two-tier banking system. So why would we do it? For the sake of disruption? We have made so much effort to make our banking system safer and sounder again, and we are still not fully finished. Why would we then discontinue with that? I think there would be a price - and maybe not a small price - in doing away with the banking system from one day to the next.   "

2018-01-31,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with RTÉ TV,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Sean Whelan on 31 January 2018","  Interview with RTÉ TV   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Sean Whelan on 31 January 2018  Mr Coeuré, as you know, the Irish Government have nominated Philip Lane for one of the positions that are coming up. How do you rate his chances? What sort of an executive board member might he make if he gets it?  Governor Lane, he's an outstanding economist. He's a good colleague on the Governing Council of the ECB. Now, as you know, the ECB has a very limited role in that process. We'll give an opinion at a later stage and it's really a political discussion; that's all what I can say.  Let's move on to the potential threat of a currency war that was raised briefly at Davos last week by the US Treasury Secretary. He was talking down the dollar. We've also seen a big post-Brexit fall in the value of sterling and both of those things are closely watched here because about two-thirds of our trade are between sterling and dollar areas. Are we on the verge of a currency war and people devaluing competitively? If we are, why shouldn't the euro do it?  Let me be very clear here; currency war is always a losing proposition, it's something where everybody loses at the end. We have agreements in the G7, in the G20 that we should not target our exchange rates. We want to see exchange rates which reflect economic and monetary policy conditions in difference places and we're not going to change it. We've seen quite some volatility recently. If that kind of volatility would lead to an unwarranted tightening of our monetary policy, we would have to reassess and consider. But I think the most important message here is: let's keep to what we've agreed in the relevant fora, which is we're not targeting exchange rates.  Well, interest rates – as you know, a perennial topic, the monetary policy of the ECB – people watching this programme tonight would be most interested knowing when the ECB is likely to raise interest rates and whether that's going to have knock-on effects particularly for their mortgage costs.  We have a clear sequence here and that's something we all agree on in the Governing Council of the ECB. We'll first discuss how and when we stop purchasing assets. Only later on in the second stage we'll discuss interest rates. We've been clear that we expect interest rates to remain at the current levels, meaning very low, for an extended period of time and well past the horizon for asset purchases. Well past means well past so that's not a discussion we're having and we really expect interest rates to remain very low for an extended period of time.  Will the asset purchases go on through September? President Draghi said last week when asked, was August next year or middle of summer next year a likely time, he said yes.  Markets form expectations. We'll have the discussion as policymakers at some point, but that's not something we have discussed so far.  The ECB obviously doesn't set market rates, the rates that banks charge to the likes of me and our viewers tonight, but you do monitor the rates that are charged. Your reporting has shown that Irish banks are consistently charging much higher rates than the eurozone average. Why are they charging so much and what can you do about it?  As you rightly say, we are not deciding on the rates charged by banks. I'm also charged by my bank in Frankfurt and I have no say on that. What we do is to set the policy rates; that is a short-term rate decided by the ECB. I would say that it mainly reflects Irish banks are still having some way to go to deal with the legacy of the crisis. They've been doing good work in terms of being more productive, more efficient. They are doing a good job to get rid of non-performing loans, but that's a journey and it's a long journey. The Central Bank of Ireland, the Irish Government have been very supportive. There's a whole strategy there but it will take time for Irish banks to come back to – totally to normality when it comes to their legacy costs. That has to be reflected somewhere.  But the Spanish banks also had a property bust and the same problems, but their rates are so much lower.  I think it's very difficult to compare different economies here because we are talking of retail rates and the structures are different in Spain and in Ireland. Well, that's an area where we still don't have a homogenous market across the eurozone. That certainly would have to be a long-term objective but we still have a fair deal of fragmentation here and local conditions do matter.  One of the consequences of the financial bust was the way banks ran themselves. Now, we've been finding out quite recently about a mortgage overcharging scandal in this country by Irish banks that carried on after the financial bust. A lot of people were of the view that the banks just haven't changed their culture. They expected because Frankfurt was getting more involved in regulation and oversight that they would. But they don't seem to be afraid of you guys or the Irish Central Bank; why not?  As you know, the way we are organised under European law is that we – in Frankfurt we are doing banking supervision, which means prudential supervision, while national authorities – including the Central Bank of Ireland – are doing consumer protection. So that's totally consistent. These are mutually reinforcing. We totally share the objectives that banks should put their clients first and they have a duty towards their clients. If there is any breach in terms of if there is any misconduct in that sense, that should be acted upon. But the way it's organised, if the CBI do it, they are doing it quite well so it helps supervision. I believe that good supervision also helps consumer protection, but these are two different tasks.  So it's up to the Irish Central Bank really to sort this problem?  Absolutely – and they are doing it.  Brexit is obviously something that a lot of people in this country in particular are worried about because we're so heavily exposed. What's the ECB's view on how Brexit might impact on the euro area, but particularly on Ireland?  So far what we can see that the economic impact has been milder than expected. That's mainly because our economy in the eurozone and also in Ireland has been much stronger than expected. So the expansion is now very robust both in Ireland and also at eurozone level. That has allowed our economies to weather the shock in a very positive way. That said, we have to turn to the long term. It's very difficult to argue that Brexit in the long term would be a positive proposition; it's going to be negative. I really trust the political process to deliver a deal, whatever it looks like, which will minimise the cost. For that we have to defer to the political process as ECB. The ECB is not doing the political negotiation; that's for leaders and that's for Monsieur Barnier. We hope it can reduce the cost.  That said, we have to prepare for possible adverse consequences. In terms of financial sector, financial services, financial stability that means that we have a duty to prepare for possible negative outcomes, hoping that it's not going to happen, but it's also our duty to prepare. But also in terms of economic management and in particular for Ireland that means that the economy has to be as strong as possible, as resilient as possible, meaning growth has been very robust but it could be more balanced. Buffers have to be built for the future, including fiscal buffers, so that's how the economy can best prepare to weather possible negative shocks.  But buffer building up will take a bit of time; we don't have time, obviously, with the Brexit process. It could be quite sudden, within a year.  So when it's comes to the financial stability consequences, that's something that we are monitoring very closely together with all national central banks – and certainly together with the Central Bank of Ireland among others. If there would be any financial stability concern, the ECB would take it very seriously, so that's something we'll be very active monitoring.  It would presumably be better handled than the last financial crisis, would it, because you've got time to prepare?  It's a totally different kind of shock. It's something that goes together with significant changes in the structure of the industry with banks as we know are relocating, moving around. So that's a different kind of preparation. On the supervisory side we also have quite intense work to make sure that any bank relocating to the eurozone would do it in a way that is sound and safe in terms of the prudential standards. Here, I am sorry to tell you, but the ECB will have no preference whether they go to Dublin or to Paris or to Luxembourg because it's all eurozone. So that's not for us to opine on.  One of the things that's often expressed by the Irish Central Bank is that more competition in banking would be good for consumers and particularly on costs and so on. We've seen this month the start of the Second Payment Services Directive. Is that going to do anything for competition in banking ?  It will and we very much hope it will. The PSD2 as it's called – Second Directive on Payment services, PSD2 – it is a competitive shock for banks. That's good because competition leads to innovation. So allowing access to payment services, to payment service providers is the same kind of shock that we had, say, in the telecom sector some 20 years ago. It's good for the consumer and it's good for innovation. Now, of course that comes with two caveats, two maybe conditions that we want to see. First, banks have to be strong enough to cushion that kind of shock. So it makes it even more needed for banks to be profitable and to have credible non-performing loan strategies because that's an additional shock they will have to cushion. It's for them to prepare for that.  Second, we want to be sure that it comes with safety and with protection of individual data privacy. So together with the Commission and with the European Banking Authority we've been very careful to design a framework that protects data and a framework that does not create risk to the safety of customer data. That will be something that we will follow very carefully in the future.  Final question for you, Benoit Coeuré, there's a lot of discussion as you know about the future of Europe going on at the political level. But there's also some bits of Europe that haven't been fully put together yet. Looking ahead to this year of 2018, from the ECB point of view what two or three things would you like to see politicians decide on to start moving on this future of Europe agenda?  So the simple answer is we just want it to happen, right? So we want them to start moving. We very much believe that the eurozone should be stronger and we don't want the ECB to be the only game in town when the next crisis hits. For that you need a stronger eurozone, so in terms of short-term priorities: that means strengthening Banking Union; moving – finding steps towards a single deposit insurance scheme in the eurozone; strengthening the single resolution fund; achieving more convergence, more harmonisation within the Banking Union. That also means being serious about the capital market union. I think that's something that Ireland has a very strong interest in and will benefit from. Capital market union is a very important project and I very much hope it can be at the top of political priorities.   "
2018-01-17,Vítor Constâncio,Interview with La Repubblica,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni on 15 January and published on 17 January 2018","  Interview with La Repubblica   Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Tonia Mastrobuoni on 15 January and published on 17 January 2018  In December, the ECB revised its growth estimates upwards and its inflation estimates downwards. You seem to be concerned by this discrepancy, and especially by the weakness of inflation, as the minutes [of the Governing Council’s December 2017 monetary policy meeting] make clear. How do you explain this?  This development is in line with a dynamic we are seeing in all the advanced economies. Growth is accelerating but inflation is still not meeting expectations. In particular, the so-called “core inflation” for December – excluding food and energy components – has been disappointing: it fell to 0.9% because wages still aren’t growing sufficiently.  But aren’t you afraid that there may be structural reasons for this sluggish price movement? Such as digitalisation, the internet economy, but also the weak position of an ever increasing number of people on precarious contracts who do not have the leverage to obtain wage rises?  Yes, the weakness of wages does play a role, as does technology, but nobody knows precisely the scale of the impact of technology.  Isn’t it ironic that the guardians of the currency and wage moderation should be encouraging trade unions and workers to be bolder?  The situation has changed. Historically, central banks have often faced inflationary pressures. Now we are in a new environment that has to do with many structural factors but also with secular stagnation.  So we are facing secular stagnation?  Well, there has been modest growth, and all the indicators say that it will continue like that in the advanced economies for many years.  But some people in the United States think there is a risk of a leap in inflation.  There are always risks but I don’t think this will be a problem for the euro area for some time to come. Inflation is weak and will remain so for some time in all the developed countries.  Are there hidden risks in the current divergence between the Fed, which is expected to increase rates three times this year, and the ECB?  There’s been a divergence several times since the start of the crisis. Central banks must respond to the particular fundamental situations of their respective economies. When they do, this does not in itself cause problems for financial markets. This is what is happening. Admittedly, the US is further on in the cycle and the Fed’s monetary policy is responding to these developments.  Do you see risks to financial stability from, to say the least, the erratic policies of Donald Trump?  Risks to the global economy come mainly from the possible reversal of risk premia in bond markets. A fall in prices and an increase in yields, if sudden and disorderly, could be a threat. We hope that the adjustment to increased growth, and higher inflation in the future, will be gradual.  Are you worried by the recent increase in the exchange rate of the euro?  Looking at fundamentals, inflation declined slightly in December. As it is known, we don’t target the exchange rate. But I am concerned about sudden movements which don’t reflect changes in fundamentals.  In the minutes of the December meeting it says that forward guidance “could be revisited” early this year. Does that mean that we should expect an increase in rates ahead of time, even this year? Or what does that mean?  It refers to how our forward guidance operates, to the fact that the assessment of our policy in relation to our objectives must include all monetary policy instruments. We see the need for a gradual adjustment of all the elements of our forward guidance if the economy continues to grow and inflation continues to move towards our goal. This does not mean that changes will be immediate.  In other words?  We are not changing the path of our monetary policy. With the decision to halve our monthly bond purchases we have adapted our monetary policy to the new economic context and consequently to the higher inflation ahead. But this does not mean that monetary policy will not remain very accommodative for a long time. We see no inflation risks. We should not choke off growth too soon.  QE will last until September: do you think it should then finally come to an end, as some of your colleagues have been saying?  That’s not a very relevant question for me because monetary policy works over the medium term. A few months either way won’t make much of a difference.  But allow me to express a doubt: going from a purchase level of €30 billion to zero could shock the markets.  I would limit myself to saying that in the subsequent part of the programme we will have to proceed cautiously, i.e. gradually.  What will happen to the bonds – will you continue to reinvest them? The Fed has already started to shrink its balance sheet.  We are reinvesting them and have so far given no indication of wanting to stop. All will depend on how the economic climate develops.  In Germany there’s a slight possibility of a “grand” coalition being formed, which could herald a Franco-German commitment to reforming the euro area. What do you make of that?   There are many ideas around and it’s the task of governments to decide. Technically, the two most important things, I think, are the completion of the banking union with the deposit insurance scheme, and the creation of an ad hoc fund with a stabilising role, if need be, to help manage growth. I have not heard any convincing arguments in favour of transforming the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) into a European Monetary Fund.  Would you keep it as it is?  Yes. It has its tasks; it performs them well. The European Commission has its role as guardian of the treaties and it monitors the countries’ adjustment programmes. And one of the major things in recent years has been the huge adjustments in the countries which ended up under most pressure during the crisis. All these countries are now growing.  You mean the so-called “peripherals” which have asked for assistance in exchange for adjustments?  Exactly, these countries, except for Spain, which is recovering, have deficits below 3% and have primary and current account surpluses. The account and economic adjustments have been extremely significant, and have been the result of improvement and reform programmes. The IMF and the ECB agree that the current account surplus of the countries that have followed an adjustment programme is structural and not the result of reduced import quotas. So if there have been improvements, why change the role of the ESM?  So you are against the idea that the ESM might become a budgetary control authority, as some have suggested?  Many ideas are being discussed; the point I am making is that the European Commission had responsibility for the adjustments in these countries, and it worked.  So it was right to give those countries flexibility on their budgets to create room to undertake reforms?  The point is that everyone is now full of praise for the efforts undertaken in those countries that are or were subject to an adjustment programme. That is what counts. So I don’t see any reason to adjust the institutional framework and create a new body, thereby reducing the role of the Commission.  Let’s talk about the most significant election happening this year, the one in Italy. Some parties are threatening to hold a referendum on the euro, to reverse the Fornero reform or the Jobs Act, proposing measures which, by our calculations, would cost €200 billion…  It’s not for me to comment on electoral programmes. What I observe is that the markets are very calm and don’t seem to believe that the risks you mention will materialise. I think the markets expect good sense to prevail in the end. More generally, if I look at countries like my own – Portugal – or Greece, with very high levels of debt, I believe that it is important to continue along the reform path.  Non-performing loans are another distinctive Italian feature. We are expecting an announcement from the ECB’s banking supervisors on the stocks of these loans. Do you anticipate risks for the market?  On the subject of non-performing loans (NPLs), it has been explained many times that the ECB’s banking supervisors aim to ensure that the banks reduce or evaluate their non-performing loans appropriately, treating each case individually. It has never been our intention to introduce rigid new rules that are applicable for all in exactly the same way. This has been made clear, and in that sense I do not anticipate risks.  Yes, but if there is a time limit by which NPLs are reduced to zero – the famous seven years – that is a restriction.  We will see how the banking supervisors decide to approach new NPLs and existing stocks. The discussion is still ongoing. One way or another, NPLs have to be reduced sooner or later. This is first and foremost in the interests of the banks. It must be said, though, that the Italian banks have reduced their levels significantly.  Do you see a risk of bubbles forming, for example in the German property market?  There is no risk of bubbles in general, not in any market in the euro area. In the housing market, average prices are in line with fundamentals, which can be estimated using various methods. In Europe, the same is true of the stock markets and the corporate bond market. The only market experiencing pressure is the commercial property market, but this does not imply systemic risks, as the residential property market would. There are hot spots concentrated in certain cities, of course, but macroprudential measures have been announced or adopted in some countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and France. And Germany may now also do the same.  There is a lot of talk about cryptocurrencies. Do they represent a threat to the financial system? What can be done to regulate them?  First of all, they are not currencies. They cannot fulfil the classic functions of a currency, the first of which is to serve as a stable unit of account which can be used to express the value of other goods. If the value of the currency itself is so volatile, then it cannot perform this function; it is in fact a speculative instrument. And their use as a means of payment is very limited. They are used in the shadow economy and in countries where institutions have collapsed and monetary systems are not working – there they are used as a payment instrument of last resort. They in no way represent a threat to traditional currencies. Of course, rising prices have led to such high market capitalisation that a collapse could have consequences. But they wouldn’t be systemic. I call these instruments “tulips”, recalling the famous tulip bubble and subsequent crash in the Netherlands in the 17th century.  But there is a political aspect. Don’t you think that they are a response to the collapse in confidence in central banks and the traditional financial system?  No, because they are not a threat to traditional currencies, they are not a reliable unit of measure. Moreover, bank deposits are rising. If there was a crisis of confidence, we would see it there.  In Estonia, Kaspar Korjus wants to introduce a cryptocurrency alongside the euro. Is this a threat?  Private-sector operators offering competition to currencies have no chance of success. Ultimately, a currency needs to have state backing, as history has demonstrated. Over the centuries, experience has shown that, even in situations much less complex than today’s, there needs to be a central bank which is given the exclusive right to print money.  Looking back over those years of turbulence, on which occasions were you anxious about the euro?  There were two. The Greek crisis in 2010. And in 2011-12, when market pressure shifted towards Spain and Italy. The European response resulted in, among other things, the creation of the ESM and the transfer of supervisory functions to the ECB. The actions of the ECB, with its Securities Markets Programme and Outright Monetary Transactions, were also crucial. Now we are seeing growth across the whole euro area, with GDP rates at a ten-year high and unemployment – although still too high – at a ten-year low. The macroeconomic equilibrium has been restored almost everywhere. There has been a complete turnaround. It is gratifying.  What has been the most important lesson for the ECB from these years of great crisis?  That non-standard measures are necessary in times of emergency. These measures, which have been deemed legal by the European Court of Justice, are now part of the ECB’s toolkit.   "
2017-12-30,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Caixin Global,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Liwei Wang on 17 December and published on 30 December 2017","  Interview with Caixin Global   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Liwei Wang on 17 December and published on 30 December 2017 I. Europe  Mr Cœuré, how is Europe’s recovery progressing?  We don’t see it as a recovery anymore, but as an expansion. The annual growth rate in the euro area is the strongest for ten years. We expect a GDP growth rate of 2.4% for 2017, which by European standards is quite high. Business and consumer confidence are at their highest levels for over 17 years, according to the November reading of the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator. Seven million jobs have been created in the euro area since mid-2013. Growth today is not only very strong, but also very broad-based. The breadth of the expansion in terms of countries and sectors is greater than at any point over the last 20 years. The expansion is also more sustainable as it is driven by domestic demand and an improving labour market, and it is less reliant on credit.  We have definitely left the crisis behind us. Europe is back!  How does it compare to the United States?  In 2016, the euro area grew faster than the United States. For 2017 and 2018, it is too early to tell, but the growth rates should be about the same. For example, the euro area flash manufacturing and composite output PMIs for December are at 60.6 (the highest since the series began in June 1997) and 58.0 (a 82-month high) respectively, comparable or somewhat higher than the level in the United States, Japan or the United Kingdom.     Is unemployment still a major issue?  Unemployment is still an issue. At 8.8% in October, the euro area unemployment rate is the lowest since early 2009, but the rate still varies considerably across the euro area. Countries such as Germany or the Netherlands have practically full employment, but others, e.g. France and Italy, still have some catching-up to do. In several Member States, such as Spain and Ireland, there have been bold labour market reforms, which are now yielding tangible benefits. This sends an important message: when European countries use a period of growth to implement further reforms, it works.  While Europe needs to rebuild fiscal buffers now, as Mario Draghi recently mentioned, the United States is embarking on a major tax reform, involving major tax cuts. How do Europeans see tasks on the fiscal side?   In Europe, there are two different discussions. One is on the level of the deficit, or “fiscal stance”, the other on the composition, i.e. the quality of public finances. In all countries, there is scope to make public finances friendlier to growth, in particular to reduce non-productive public spending and cut distortionary taxes. But not many countries have fiscal space, because their public debt is too high. Their priority should be to use the current economic expansion to rebuild fiscal buffers, so that when the next crisis hits, they can use fiscal policy to react to it. In the meantime, they can still improve the composition of their public finances. There are a few countries, including Germany, that do have fiscal space. These countries should use that space to prepare for the future, although it is not for the ECB to tell them how to do it.  So Europeans need to carry out their own fiscal agenda, not follow the US?  It’s not for the ECB to comment, but I don't see a great appetite among European leaders to follow the US example at the current juncture.  What are the risks to Europe’s economy?  Risks are broadly balanced in our view, with positive risks coming from the euro area and negative risks coming from outside. The latter include geopolitical risks and risks stemming from emerging market economies.  At a deeper level, we see risks to global growth resulting from the erosion of support for international trade and openness. Europe clearly remains committed to openness and international cooperation. We are open for business. We don’t agree with those countries which want to curb international trade.  And let me add a more political remark. In a world which is more uncertain and volatile than ever, Europe can project itself on the world stage and work jointly with China to provide stability.  What are the positive risks from Europe?   History tells us that people tend to underestimate economic downturns and, likewise, in an upturn, there is a risk of underestimating the strength of the economy. For instance, we see very positive dynamics stemming from investment and domestic demand, and this creates positive multiplier effects.  II. Central banking  With the recovery turning into an expansion, it seems we are still not quite seeing monetary policy normalisation (QExit and rate rises)?   Indeed, our monetary policy will remain very accommodative. It has a single objective, which is to bring euro area inflation back to a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Because inflation is still not at 2%, we will maintain an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The strength of the recovery gives us increasing confidence that inflation will return towards 2% in a sustainable manner. That led to our decision to recalibrate our monetary policy support. We decided in October to reduce our monthly net asset purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion from January until at least September 2018, and longer if needed. By halving the monthly asset purchases we are recognising both the strength of the recovery and our greater confidence in the inflation outlook.  The euro area is not alone among major economies in having inflation that is kind of muted. Any fundamental reasons for this?  I think that we need a degree of humility here. There are many things we don’t understand very well, for example the impact of technology on industrial organisation, wages and prices. Technological change certainly is a common explanation for low inflation in all advanced economies. Low productivity gains are also one explanation for the sustained weakness in wages across advanced economies, which in turn also have an impact on inflation. There are factors specific to Europe as well, in particular high unemployment. Both the United States and Japan are close to full employment, while Europe is not. Europe is lagging behind the United States and Japan in the business cycle and still has some slack to absorb before reaching full employment. Many of the newly created jobs are based on part-time or fixed-term contracts, which dampen the prospect of rapid wage increases. That helps explain why inflation will only slowly move back towards 2% and why we still need ample monetary accommodation.  European financial markets already show a lot of frothiness, just like in the US.   In Europe, we see frothiness in some market segments or asset classes, but nothing that would be a concern at euro area level and would call for a monetary policy reaction. Local issues call for local solutions, separate from monetary policy, or what we call macroprudential measures. A very recent example is the decision last Friday [15 December 2017] by the French macroprudential authority, the High Council for Financial Stability, to propose a measure to limit the exposure of large French banks to the most indebted companies, given concerns related to corporate debt growth in France. The macroprudential toolbox is being used. It has been used in several euro area countries, such as in Ireland in the case of mortgages. The ECB is monitoring this closely. In principle we have the possibility to top up national measures, although we haven’t done so yet.  Your colleague, Yves Mersch, said earlier this month: “Nourishing a market belief that the exit might be permanently postponed could exacerbate the potential cliff effects”. An official from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) made remarks along the same lines recently, warning of the risk of markets gaming monetary policy while rates remain low. How do you see central banks’ interaction with markets?  There is always a risk of central banks being led by financial markets instead of leading them.  We can’t ignore market reactions, because markets are important transmitters of monetary policy. This is also why we place importance on communication and lay out as clearly as possible our reaction function in our forward guidance. But we have to keep in mind that the ultimate yardstick for our action is inflation. We are not targeting financial asset prices. Given the strength of the expansion, we are increasingly confident that inflation will rise towards 2% over the medium term. This justifies a gradual and cautious recalibration of monetary policy. Markets have to understand that QE will not last forever.   Could it be a bit behind the curve?   We have flexibility to react both ways. Given what we see in the economy, I believe that there is a reasonable chance that the extension of our asset purchase programme decided in October can be the last. But the Governing Council of the ECB has also made it clear that the programme can be kept in place for longer, should inflation disappoint on the downside. And if inflation turned out to be higher than currently expected, we would have plenty of instruments with which to react.  The generation of central bank governors who handled the crisis has now either retired or is close to retiring. How do you regard what they’ve done?  The main lesson from this crisis is that you have to think outside the box, be innovative, while at the same time staying within your political mandate. It’s a very delicate balance, but the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the ECB have all done it and succeeded. Central bankers in some circumstances have to be bold and fast, but they also have to do things in a politically and legally acceptable manner. That’s what they’ve done, and that is also something to remember for the future.   Can central bankers push politicians to act if they are slow to act or make reforms?   Central bankers have no mandate and no legitimacy to push politicians. At the same time, they have a duty to speak their mind and publicly state what they think is necessary for economic policy.  III. China  Governor Zhou of the PBOC is also to retire (soon)? Looking from the outside, how do you see him?  What I particularly notice is Governor Zhou’s international role. I’ve listened to him many times in Basel, Washington and other places. He’s one of the most respected governors around the table. When he takes the floor, everyone stops to listen to him, which is not always the case in international meetings.  What has always struck me is that he expresses China’s position in a very clear way but he also aims to move the discussion on, seeking a consensus. That’s extremely valuable in an international discussion.  For me, the very thoughtful and analytical way he has of addressing issues is a very important contribution. He always takes the time to explain complex issues, including for instance recent developments in China’s financial system, which can be quite complex for outsiders to understand. He has a very clear and concise way of explaining things, making discussions more constructive.   How does the global central banking community view the PBOC’s role in recent years?  Over the last ten years or so, there has been a clear evolution. The PBOC has been engaging more and more with the international community and its central bank counterparts, in line with the changing role of China in the global economy. From an ECB perspective, I can say that we now have a relationship with the PBOC that is as broad and deep as it is with a core group of other central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and maybe a few others. This includes discussions on financial markets, monetary policy, payment systems, to name just a few. The PBOC is part of that core group.  The ECB in June invested a small amount of foreign reserves in the renminbi. Why? Any plans ahead?   The amount is equivalent to €500 million, roughly 1% of the ECB’s foreign currency reserves. We sold US dollar reserves to do this. At the end of 2016, the ECB’s reserves consisted of 83% US dollars and 17% Japanese yen. We also have a €45 billion/RMB 350 billion bilateral currency swap agreement with the PBOC. Both initiatives are an acknowledgement of the growing international role of the renminbi and a first step towards a better understanding of how the Chinese monetary and foreign exchange markets work. I’m quite sure that there will be further steps in the future. But central banks are conservative by nature. This is a long-term process.  How do you see the prospect of RMB internationalisation?  To understand the international monetary system, one needs to take a very long-term perspective, even if the rise of China on the global economic stage has been much faster than anything we’ve seen before.  It’s quite evident to me that the renminbi will eventually become a major international currency, and I personally believe that a multi-polar monetary system is good for the stability of the global economy. For the renminbi to achieve that status, further steps will need to be taken, including a further opening of the capital account, the pace and modalities of which are for the Chinese authorities to decide. IV. Digital currency and fintech  What do you think of Bitcoin?  What we are witnessing today is clearly a bubble, made possible by scarcity and by an expected sequence of gains which investors believe will be sustained, irrespective of the fundamentals. That is the definition of a bubble. Bitcoin is not a currency. Investors should not believe that they will be able to use it as a means of payment. It is a speculative investment. There is a risk of large capital losses which investors should be aware of. So the main concern related to Bitcoin is not a monetary one but one that relates to investor protection, and possibly also to tax evasion, money laundering and criminal finance.  With two American exchanges (CBOE and CME) introducing Bitcoin futures, how do you see the policy for it going forward?  The ECB is not a securities regulator. Regulators worldwide have recently warned investors repeatedly about possible losses. In Europe, the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, adopted by the European Council and the European Parliament last Friday [15 December 2017] requires exchange platforms and wallet providers to report suspicious transactions and identify owners of digital currencies. I’m quite sure that further steps will be taken to regulate this market.  How do you see the prospect of central bank digital currencies?   This is an area where central banks tread with great caution, because different jurisdictions face different trends in the demand for cash, and because we have to assess the full impact of any change in the way we operate, both for the citizens of our countries and for the structure of financial intermediation. In that respect, I would make a clear distinction between wholesale and retail applications.  Starting with wholesale markets, we see that distributed ledger technology (DLT) has a lot of potential for market infrastructures. All major central banks are looking into it. The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) of the Bank for International Settlements, which I chair, published a report on it in February 2017.  The ECB has undertaken a pilot project with the Bank of Japan in this area. We concluded that the technology is not yet mature enough to migrate large-value payment systems – in our case, TARGET2 – to a DLT-based infrastructure, but we’ll continue to study it carefully. The question will arise as to whether central banks could at some point provide central bank money to financial market infrastructures in a digital form. We are still in the early stages of that discussion, but it is a relevant one.   Is this similar to the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) renewal programme under way in the United Kingdom?  Indeed, the Bank of England sees potential benefits from DLT for future RTGS systems, although, like us, it believes that this technology it is not yet sufficiently mature. But we will continue to look into it.  As for the retail side, that is, central bank digital currencies replacing banknotes and coins, we are much more prudent. First, there are only a limited number of countries where demand for cash is clearly on a downward trend. Sweden is faced with such a situation, but in the euro area we are not. We are therefore not being pushed to go in that direction.   Second, we also have to consider the implications for security and trust in the currency. Today, we invest a lot of resources in fighting the counterfeiting of banknotes. What would fraud, and fraud combat, look like in an environment with a digital currency? And third, we want to make sure that we fully understand the long-term consequences for the financial system. Today, most of the money used in the economy is created by banks. How would digital money affect the role of banks as financial intermediaries, and would it make the financial system more, or less, stable? These are issues on which much more reflection is required, hence our great caution.  How does the ECB’s new TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) initiative factor into this?  This is actually my last point. A lot of the current interest in central bank digital currencies, or private digital currencies, stems from the fact that people expect them to be faster and cheaper than existing means of payment. These expectations can be easily met by upgrading existing payment systems. That’s true for domestic payments, and it is exactly what we’re doing in Europe with TIPS, an infrastructure allowing for 24/7, 365-day instant payments. TIPS will go live in November 2018.  It’s also true for cross-border payments. But here we are less advanced. One reason why Bitcoin is popular is because it allows for cross-border payments that are cheaper and faster than with existing infrastructures. The international community has a duty to get together and act to improve the speed and cost of cross-border payments, to avoid being taken over by technologies such as Bitcoin, which entail risks for their users, not to mention possible fraud and crime.  In China, private sector non-banks are also becoming disruptive players in the payment space.  In Europe, we have a new legal framework for payments entering into force in January 2018, called the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Under this revised framework, payment service providers (PSPs) can be non-banks and will have access to the bank accounts of their customers, but at the same time they will be regulated, not only in terms of financial stability but also in terms of data use and privacy. Opening up the payments market is good for consumers and it will spur innovation, but it should not come at the expense of privacy and security.   How do you see technology and tech firms’ impact on banks and the financial structure?  In a nutshell, fintech creates opportunities for non-bank actors to become players in the financial services sector. It has the potential to significantly destabilise the banking system or at least to erode its profitability. Bear in mind that PSD2 is designed to introduce more competition by requiring banks to share data that they today use to cross-sell financial services. With access to such data, fintech companies could for instance increasingly capture the value formerly retained by banks.  I see two broad scenarios. In the first one, banks rise to the challenge, cut costs, internalise new technology, including by purchasing fintech companies, and gain new sources of revenue. This scenario crucially assumes that banks are profitable enough to carry out the necessary technological investments. In the other scenario, banks fail to internalise fintech and run the risk of becoming mere platforms, with all the value being created outside. This could happen in particular if digital giants, who already have access to large amounts of customer data, start targeting parts of the banking value chain, ultimately crowding banks out of large swathe of financial services.  Firms and households may then benefit from new financial services and products, but the stability of the banking system would be at stake, and regulation would need to be carefully reviewed to close any loopholes.  What role can central banks or regulators play in this?  We need to stick to a very simple principle: equivalent activities should be regulated in an equivalent way. For instance, if we see non-bank players starting to provide credit, they will need to be regulated in an equivalent way, although not necessarily the same way, giving different deposit-taking restrictions.  And since all these activities are cross-border, we need international coordination. The right forum for this discussion is the Financial Stability Board, where Chinese authorities are active participants.  "
2017-12-29,Yves Mersch,Interview with Börsen-Zeitung,"Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Mark Schrörs und Detlef Fechtner on 18 December and published on 29 December 2017","  Interview with Börsen-Zeitung   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Mark Schrörs und Detlef Fechtner on 18 December and published on 29 December 2017  Mr Mersch, the euro area economy is booming and inflation is picking up. Will 2018 be the year of monetary policy change for the ECB, with a shift away from the ultra-loose monetary policy of the crisis years?  The change actually already got under way a year ago. We first reduced our monthly asset purchases from €80 billion to €60 billion, and as of January we will in fact be down to €30 billion. We are also letting our targeted longer-term refinancing operations expire. So it really cannot be said that we have not taken the improved data into account. Our monetary policy is data-dependent, and we always react to the latest developments. This will also be the case in 2018.  But the ECB has always downplayed the significance of all these decisions. Do you think that market participants have understood that the change is already under way, as you say it is?   Sometimes markets react more quickly than expected and sometimes they take a bit longer. And sometimes they overreact, so we have to be very careful. We don’t want to cause any upset. But it is indeed surprising that long-term interest rates are now lower than they were in the summer, although growth has surprised very positively and growth and inflation forecasts have been adjusted upwards. It doesn’t really follow.  The main thing for 2018 will be a decision on quantitative easing (QE), i.e. the large-scale purchase of assets, which is currently locked in until 2018. If growth and inflation develop as currently expected, will that be the end of QE?  We will make that decision when the time comes. Keeping the end-date open now was the right thing for the Governing Council to do. The first step is to implement the decision to halve our purchases to €30 billion. But as ECB President Mario Draghi recently said, we are now more confident that inflation is on a sustainable path towards our medium-term objective of below, but close to, 2%. But the more confident we are of meeting our objective, the more the likelihood of a further increase in our purchase programme trends towards zero.  So far there has been a one-sided promise to increase QE “in terms of size and/or duration”, i.e. maintain the “easing bias”, if the outlook for inflation worsens or financing conditions become unduly tight.  It’s certainly a valid question to ask whether a promise that has a near-zero probability should continue to be made. Indeed, in the short term the risks to growth and inflation are more on the upside, meaning that both could turn out to be higher than currently forecast. So it makes increasingly less sense to give a one-sided signal that addresses the eventuality of the situation unexpectedly deteriorating. So there is certainly scope for adjusting our communication on the easing bias soon. To a certain extent, this has already been done with the statement about our greater confidence in the path of inflation. In addition, it is clear that the net purchases are becoming less important compared with the holdings on the central bank’s balance sheet, the reinvestments and forward guidance. This will no doubt be reflected in our communication as well.  If QE comes to an end in 2018, would it be sufficient to start communicating on this in the summer, or would preparations have to start earlier?  It shouldn’t be left until the very last minute – the markets should be prepared in a proactive and ongoing way. This is important so that we avoid false expectations and short-term market turbulence. It would certainly be appropriate to take a position on this point before summer 2018.  Would there need to be a gradual winding-down from €30 billion, a “tapering”, or could the ECB drop to zero in one step?  We haven’t yet gone through the various options in the Governing Council. The expert committees will also need to be involved in the preparations. Our aim is not to cause an unnecessary stir in the markets, and we will stick to this position.  The markets were recently hoping for more information about how the reduction to €30 billion would be distributed between the individual purchase programmes. Doesn’t the Governing Council need to provide more guidance on this?  We will continue to purchase mainly public sector bonds, and the rest will be invested in private sector instruments. Corporate sector purchases will probably account for a slightly larger share, as we won’t necessarily reduce these purchases proportionally. But the exact composition of the €30 billion will depend on the situation in the market. We need a certain amount of flexibility, because market conditions can change quickly.  Is the ECB still in control of affairs, especially now that self-imposed purchase limits are becoming increasingly relevant?  We are able to conduct our asset purchase programme. The important thing here is that we want to remain market-neutral. And we shouldn’t overdo the discussion on the composition of the €30 billion. Including reinvestments, we will still be buying securities for more than €50 billion in some months. The question of whether we invest, say, €1 billion more or less in corporate bonds is not decisive.   To what extent have the Governing Council’s discussions been affected by the Steinhoff issue – that is, losses resulting from the purchase of bonds issued by the beleaguered furniture retailer – especially given that Council members hold very different views on corporate sector asset purchases?  The Steinhoff case hasn’t resulted in any discussion in the Governing Council about changing the asset purchase programme. We have certain rules regarding the suitability of individual instruments. We don’t blindly buy 100% of a given bond, we watch the market constantly. The important thing for me is that we don’t take on excessive risk. We also keep a constant eye on our risk management framework and adjust it if we see a need to do so.  The Governing Council doesn’t want to consider raising interest rates until “well” after the end of net QE purchases, which is known as “sequencing”. This follows the example of the Federal Reserve in the United States. But the Federal Reserve never had negative rates. Doesn’t at least the negative deposit facility rate need to be scrapped more quickly?  The slightly negative interest rates support our asset purchase programme. If we had not had them, we might have needed to buy greater volumes to achieve the same effects. But the net purchases are becoming increasingly less significant. And the sequencing is something that the markets have understood very well. So we need to move step by step towards a normalisation of our monetary policy, we shouldn’t rush it.  But isn’t the negative rate a special case?  There are very different views about negative interest rates. We haven’t seen any excessive distortions so far, and the advantages predominate. But this does not lead me to conclude that we should hang on to negative rates for a long time to come. Can you imagine that a whole generation is growing up without knowing what it means to gain interest on money? There is a risk of the savings culture being undermined, and we need to keep a close eye on this. The bottom line is that we need to approach the normalisation of our monetary policy carefully and gradually. But we also need to be very careful that we do not act too tentatively and too late and end up falling “behind the curve”.   How much do you worry that the ECB would have hardly any ammunition left with which to counter a future downturn?  We are always saying that fiscal policy should build up buffers in good times. But that is also true for monetary policy. If a central bank were to run out of ways to react to a recession, that would be worrying. This too demonstrates that the current level of interest rates is certainly not the normal state of affairs.  In the United States the first interest rate rise came 14 months after the end of QE. In the case of the ECB, that would mean that if QE were to end in September 2018, the first rate increase would be in November 2019. Some market participants are even reckoning with 2020. Do you feel comfortable with such expectations?   We do not follow the example of others. Our actions are determined solely by the requirements of the euro area. 2019 and 2020 are a long way off; nobody can make reliable predictions that far ahead. I can only advise against tying oneself down so far in advance. That could damage credibility.  But the forward guidance on interest rates goes in that direction.  Forward guidance at some point reaches its limits. That has to be acknowledged. It was a useful additional tool in a specific context. But once we start heading back towards normality, forward guidance should not be expanded, it should be scaled back. We shouldn’t limit our room for manoeuvre indefinitely.  Are banks, businesses and governments sufficiently prepared for a future interest rate turnaround?  There have always been people who believe in Father Christmas and who think that everything will continue as it is. Those who don’t prepare themselves for increases in interest rates will ultimately be at a disadvantage. Even changes in the purchase programmes will affect the yield curve. But it’s not the ECB’s task to guarantee that the curve will always remain so flat. We, the ECB, via monetary policy normalisation, should pay heed to moving our focus from long-term interest rates back to the short end. The more a central bank concentrates on the long term, the closer it gets to redistribution – this is worrying from the perspective of economic governance (“Ordnungspolitik”).  Who has the most catching-up to do – banks, business or governments?  Some countries need to do much more to solve the problem of non-performing loans, the NPLs. Other countries are still taking on too much new debt, and others meanwhile have not built up any fiscal buffers at all. It must be clear to everyone that we don’t conduct monetary policy for individual economic actors, but for the whole of the euro area economy.  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann is concerned that the ECB will face ever greater political pressure.  Of course, some countries are more resistant to reform than others. But we’ve also seen that countries which hadn’t undertaken reforms for a very long time were, in the end, able to do the necessary. Consider the reforms in France under President Emmanuel Macron. Such reforms are certainly more convincing for markets than merely making proposals on creating a European “debt union”.   Concerning NPLs, the ECB’s banking supervisors want to be stricter, but are encountering a lot of political opposition within the EU. Are the euro area countries unwilling after all to address the problems of their banks?  The NPL problem has to be solved, no doubt about that. But you have to distinguish between substance and form. We supervise the banks, but are not the regulator. The relevant institutions, within their competences, must address the problems in a timely and determined manner. Despite all the criticism of the form no-one should hide behind it and wait for the problem to resolve itself.  Could you imagine banking supervision being separated from the ECB sometime, as is being demanded particularly in Germany?  I can imagine a lot of things. But I’m not convinced that the previous German model was better. Personally, I am very strongly convinced that monetary policy needs access and proximity to the supervisory authority in order to fulfil its mandate. There is no ideal model for this proximity. I’m not convinced by the argument that supervision would function better outside the ECB.   The ECB was also criticised for pushing for a change to its statute in order to obtain more effective control over clearing houses. Was that a mistake?  No. A stronger role for the ECB in the oversight of central counterparties is quite clearly a monetary policy responsibility. I fail to understand those insinuating that we are expanding our mandate. Monetary policy has to deal with those entities where liquidity is collected and pooled. If we didn’t take care of this, we would be recklessly negligent of our mandate.  How concerned are you about the rising value of Bitcoin? Is it a risk to financial stability?  First of all, Bitcoin turnover is between €250 and €350 billion. The volume is therefore comparatively low. That’s why Bitcoin trading is not at present an issue for monetary policy. Regarding the increase in price, we are seeing speculative hype that might be a cause for concern. But of course individual investors are free to gamble. However, if something goes wrong, they should not come to us and say we should have outlawed it and protected them from themselves. Second, there are now banks which hold positions in Bitcoin. It is a matter for the supervisors to judge how big the risks are. Third, and what concerns me most, is when financial market infrastructures such as stock exchanges enter this business. That poses a major threat to financial stability.  So you don’t think much of Bitcoin futures and other recent developments?  If these transactions are kept separate from others, it’s a secondary matter who wins and who loses. However, if all the participants in these financial centres are jointly liable, that can create difficulties, for instance, for banks or the whole system. And if the banking system gets into trouble, there will again be demands for support from the ECB. I would say from the outset: we shouldn’t do this.   Do you think that private cryptocurrencies could become a real alternative to central bank money?  Money needs trust. Public currencies, for example the euro, have the backing of public institutions such as the ECB. Many of these currencies have no backing, nothing. It’s a somewhat different matter for the underlying technology, the blockchain. That’s a challenge we all have to face, especially banks. Each institution has to know that in the future financial intermediation will no longer be heaven-sent, but has to be fought for.  Bundesbank Executive Board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele has raised hopes for a return of the €500 banknote. The Governing Council’s decision to stop issuing the €500 only relates to the second series of banknotes and probably a new series of banknotes will appear in the next decade. Is that correct?  Strictly speaking, the decision to suspend the €500 banknote only concerns the second series, so that’s correct. But it’s unlikely that we would resume production. We shouldn’t try to turn the clock back. In theory, the Governing Council is free to change its mind tomorrow. But I think the chances of that are as high as for additional net purchases under QE.  Let us come back in more detail to the matter of monetary policy: do you think that there will be a return to the normality that prevailed before the global financial crisis – or is there a “new normal”, with, for example, inflation at a permanently lower level and instruments such as bond purchases being a permanent feature?  I don’t think we’re already living in a “new normal”. The discussion on this should continue but caution is called for. There are certainly factors which have a lasting impact on prices – ageing populations, new technologies, globalisation. But many of the factors that keep inflation below target are also temporary. I am convinced, as is the Governing Council, that we are definitely able to reach our objective of below, but close to, 2%. We are already seeing a build-up of reflationary forces. In the future we can certainly have a debate about our objective – as we did in the early 2000s. But we shouldn’t have this debate if we are just short of our objective. That would only destroy confidence.  Irrespective of 2% – is “inflation targeting” outdated?  Inflation targeting is fashionable, but it’s fading. In a region as varied as the euro area, we were well advised not to impose on ourselves a strict inflation targeting regime, but to be more flexible. We have settled for a definition of price stability over the medium term of below, but close to, 2 %. I think it has served us very well.   And are you worried that the era of central bank independence could be coming to an end?  I am very concerned about these discussions. But as central bankers we also have our own responsibility: the more space we occupy, the more we need to ask ourselves whether that is still compatible with our independence. We need a tightly defined mandate. The closer we move to the political domain the greater the risk of our getting burnt.   "
2017-11-21,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Handelsblatt,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 15 November and published on 21 November 2017","  Interview with Handelsblatt   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jan Mallien and Frank Wiebe on 15 November and published on 21 November 2017  Mr Cœuré, the European Central Bank (ECB) took on a very important role in stabilising the euro area during the crisis. How can Europe avoid overburdening the ECB with problems which should be solved by politicians?  To avoid overburdening the ECB, the euro area needs a strong economic pillar and a strong fiscal pillar. And let me add a personal remark: the world today is in disarray. It needs Europe to provide economic stability and political direction. Europe, therefore, has to be strong and have a clear sense of where it wants to go.  In order to become stronger, Europe is discussing the banking union, a euro area budget and a sort of European Monetary Fund. What is your take on these issues?  We are glad that the discussion on the future of Europe and the euro has restarted. As a central bank, we shouldn’t interfere in the details of a political debate. But we have a stake in it. The crisis forced us to design instruments that made it possible to address a very difficult situation. We have done this within our mandate, as the European Court of Justice has confirmed. But we don’t know what the next crisis will look like. And we don’t want it to test the limits of our mandate.  What is the most important issue, if you want to prevent that?  Completing the banking union is a priority. This includes a common deposit insurance scheme and further progress to reduce risks in the banking system. It also means that all banks should operate and be supervised in the same way. It’s a whole set of measures. Some may require legal changes, as the ECB’s banking supervision and the European Commission have suggested. This will take time.  There have been arguments about non-performing loans (NPLs) in Italy. Italian politicians have criticised the ECB’s plan to clean up banks’ balance sheets. What is your response?  I am not a lawyer, but I understand the recent guidance provided by the ECB’s banking supervision to be a clarification of how it will assess banks’ actions with regard to future NPLs. It has provided similar clarity in other areas in the past. Had it not done so, it would now be accused of not being transparent. But I must insist that NPLs are not just an issue for regulators and supervisors. Reducing the stock of NPLs will make the system safer and the recovery more robust. Making substantial progress on this issue will benefit the whole euro area economy. One of the reasons why growth in Europe is lagging behind that of the United States is that we started to tackle problems in the financial system later. The current discussion should not be an excuse to postpone taking action that is important for the European recovery and the completion of banking union.  Let’s talk about the other pillars that Europe needs. What changes would you like to see on the fiscal side?  The priority here is for euro area countries to put their houses in order and comply with the fiscal rules, so they can regain fiscal space. Only then can a common fiscal capacity be put in place.   Is there a need for a larger common budget?  I see two different discussions here, which are sometimes muddled up. The first is about how to fund tasks like defence or addressing migration, which may be better managed at EU level .  This requires common action, either using existing instruments (such as the European Investment Bank and the European budget) or new ones. The second discussion is about helping the euro area cope with large economic shocks without overburdening the ECB, as I just mentioned. This can be done by strengthening the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and creating a euro area budget, while making sure that it does not undermine sound fiscal management at national level.   The second point sounds like setting up a sort of European Monetary Fund, a European version of the International Monetary Fund.  I would prefer to call it a European Stability Fund. Let’s not suggest that it can be funded by central bank money creation, because it can’t. It has to be a fiscal instrument.   How could this mechanism work?  The ESM has been a success and there are ways to make it stronger and more agile. For example, one idea which has been put forward is that the ESM could offer precautionary credit lines for countries that have good policies and stick to the fiscal rules. This would be an insurance against external shocks. Another desirable reform, in my view, would be to strengthen the European Parliament’s scrutiny of euro area crisis management.  France and Germany seem to have different visions regarding this framework. Is there a chance of them reaching an agreement?  France and Germany have a duty to agree! In recent EU history, they have always had different starting points, and always ended up agreeing. But the other countries also have to be heard and respected. It will be a long discussion, which is why it needs to start soon.  How long will it take?  My preference is for the discussion to take a bit longer and lead to a strong outcome, as opposed to rushing it and producing only a symbolic outcome. The real deadline is the European Parliament elections in the spring of 2019.  Let’s move on to your core task, monetary policy. At its October meeting the Governing Council decided to halve the monthly asset purchases from the beginning of next year, and keep on buying at least until the end of September. Why don’t you go to zero?  The European recovery is the strongest for the last decade, and the broadest for the last two decades. But inflation remains weak. There are some signs that it is ticking up, but it remains dependent on our monetary support. Also in Germany, inflationary pressures are surprisingly subdued. There is very broad agreement in the Governing Council that monetary policy needs to remain accommodative until inflation moves back towards 2% in a sustainable way.  Some members of the Governing Council have argued for a specific end date of the purchases. Why have you opted against that?  Most members agreed that we need flexibility on the end date because September 2018 is still far away, and many things can happen in the global economy between now and then. But there is a growing sense that the effectiveness of our monetary policy is now less reliant on our net asset purchases.  Why?  As Mario Draghi explained in his press conference, our monetary support relies on three elements: monthly net asset purchases, the stock of acquired assets and forthcoming reinvestments, and our forward guidance on interest rates. In particular, we have now purchased so many bonds that the impact on financial conditions of this very large stock of bonds is sizeable, meaning that we can buy less month after month without jeopardising the effectiveness of our purchases.  Could you explain that in a bit more detail?  There are several reasons for this. We will reduce the pace of purchases but will still buy more bonds than will be supplied next year, which will keep long term interest rates low. For example, there is ample excess liquidity, which is keeping short-term interest rates down. Moreover, bond supply and demand conditions matter. We will still buy a multiple of the net supply of new bonds in 2018. That will keep long-term interest rates low despite the reduction in the pace of monthly purchases. We are also seeing a change in the nature of the investors who sell us bonds. In the first months of our asset purchase programme back in 2015, we bought many bonds from overseas investors. Now our counterparts are increasingly buy-and-hold euro area investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies. They are more eager to keep the bonds because of regulatory requirements and their own asset-liability management constraints. That means that they are only prepared to sell at a higher price, which makes our action on interest rates more effective for each euro we spend. And finally, we will reinvest all bonds coming to maturity for an extended period of time. All of this makes additional net asset purchases less and less necessary.  In the introductory statement to the October press conference, the ECB retained the link between asset purchases and inflation, namely that asset purchases will continue until there is a sustainable convergence of inflation towards your definition of price stability – below, but close to, 2%. Why?  I expect this link to change when the Governing Council is sufficiently confident that net asset purchases are less needed for inflation to return towards 2% in a sustainable way. We were not ready to make that change in October, but I expect it will come at some point between now and September 2018.   But there are also Governing Council members like Peter Praet who have quite strongly emphasised this link. Is there disagreement in the Council?   I expect our interest rate guidance to gain importance over time, up to a point where the delinking you mention will become possible. Some members thought it would be possible now, while others thought that it would only be possible later. In my view, the discussion is more about the timing than the substance.  And you are in the first camp?  I am part of the large majority of Governing Council members who believe that a substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed. But I think that we can better exploit the trade-off between our different instruments, while also being mindful of potential risks to financial stability.  Recently you said that you hope the asset purchases will end in September. That sounds more hawkish than Mario Draghi.  For me, it’s the logical conclusion. The economic environment is improving, price pressures are building up and we’ve become less reliant on our monthly net purchases. So we can be hopeful that the October extension was the last one.   Do you think asset purchases should be a permanent instrument of monetary policy?   Asset purchases have been an extraordinary answer to an extraordinary situation, and they’ve worked very well. But capital markets in Europe are different to those in the United States. They are not as deep, which is why I believe that asset purchases will remain an exceptional instrument, but they will not be a permanent part of our monetary policy. At some point we will come back to “normal” monetary policy where we move rates up and down.  A crucial model for central banks is the Phillips curve, which essentially assumes that lower unemployment will lead to inflation. Does the Phillips curve still exist?  I think that we need to show a healthy degree of restraint because the world is changing and there are many things that we do not understand. We have been through the worst economic crisis since 1929. It has had a huge impact on European economies in terms of the level of unemployment and the persistence of the impact on the labour market. It is no surprise that the patterns we had become used to over the last 20 or 30 years have become weaker. Moreover, technological and structural changes in the economy are affecting the way the labour market functions in ways we don’t yet fully understand.  But it is still a puzzle why inflation is not picking up when unemployment is going down.  I find it less of a mystery in Europe than in the United States, because the labour participation rate has been going up throughout the crisis, partly due to increases in the retirement age. In Europe, unemployment being high means that many workers have remained in the labour market, which puts downward pressure on wages. In the United States, workers have been pushed out and many won’t come back. The labour market is close to full employment so there should be wage pressures which we are not yet seeing.  But what is behind low wage growth in the United States?  It must be related to ongoing organisational and technological change, global forces and low productivity gains. The US situation should be a warning to us: there is a risk that nominal wages will remain subdued even when pressures build up in euro area labour markets, because of low productivity gains. Incidentally, this is what we’re also seeing in Germany.  For many years central banks have pushed very hard to boost inflation. But despite the fact that they are still not satisfied with the level of inflation, the economy is doing very well. Can’t we be satisfied with that and be a bit more relaxed about inflation?   I can understand why politicians may think that way, but as central bankers we can’t. Our mandate is narrow, and it is a price stability mandate.   In the United States there is quite an open discussion about the inflation target. Isn’t it time to start that discussion in Europe as well?   I really do not think that it is the right time to start a discussion on the ECB’s definition of price stability, in either direction. Throughout the crisis we have been an anchor of stability. If you look at longer-term inflation expectations, they have been very stable, and this has helped avoid deflation. This anchor remains needed at a time when the euro area is still coping with the legacy of the crisis.   Another topic that is currently the subject of heated debate is the possibility of Bitcoins replacing cash. How important is this topic for the ECB?  There are different forms of digital currency. Bitcoin is not a currency; it is a financial instrument which creates major risks for investors because its value is highly unstable, not to mention the issues of tax evasion and criminal activity. This is not a monetary policy discussion. On the other hand, new technologies are being developed on wholesale financial markets, such as the use of Blockchain for clearing and settlement, which may one day require digital money to settle transactions. We are looking into it because we have to follow all technological developments. Finally, whether there should be a shift out of cash and towards digital currencies issued by central banks is yet another discussion.   What is your view on that?  I believe that central banks should be extremely cautious when they deal with such issues, because they concern trust in the currency. There are different views on the use of cash. Germany, for example, is a country where people remain very much attached to cash. Different societies will have different opinions.  "
2017-11-09,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with France Info TV,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Paul Chapel on 9 November 2017","  Interview with France Info TV   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jean-Paul Chapel on 9 November 2017  Global indebtedness is at record levels. Government debt in the rich countries stands at over 100% of GDP. Isn’t that sowing the seeds for the next global crisis?  It’s a matter that calls for attention, but I don’t think it will be the cause of the next financial crisis.  What will cause it then?  I don’t know. But at the ECB we are more concerned about the rapid rise in private debt.  Corporate debt?  Yes, corporate debt, and shadow banking – those loans that are not made by banks.  Dark banks...  Shadow banks. They are insufficiently regulated. Also, there’s a widespread temptation to relax banking regulations, at a time when, as you say, interest rates are very low. All that is a source of risk. Government debt is a concern, but it doesn’t threaten to trigger a financial crisis. When the next crisis hits Europe we want to be sure that Member States, governments, have budgetary firepower. Today, that power is very limited or even non-existent. That’s why countries have to deleverage.  But in the meantime, you, the central banks, the European Central Bank and other banks, with low interest rates, ample liquidity, you are inflating these bubbles…  It’s true that the low rates can create financial stability risks; we’re aware of that. The longer we conduct these policies, the longer the rates will remain low and these risks will exist. That shows how urgent it is to have growth policies which do not rely mainly on monetary policy. A full mix of policies would be healthier from this point of view, since they would not create financial stability risks. We are closely following this and at the moment we see no financial bubbles at euro area level. There are some small, worrying signs in some countries. In France, for example, corporate debt is rising very quickly. But there is nothing that would justify the ECB withdrawing its support for growth. Monetary policy supports growth and job creation. For that reason we won’t be withdrawing support now.  Let’s talk about Europe, about its construction. It’s the issue that’s stirring up anger. Jean-Baptiste Duval of the Huffington Post would like to ask a question on that.   “Europe was a great success”, you said in [your interview with] Le Journal du Dimanche, but what exactly are you talking about? About the “no” in the 2005 referendum, wonderfully ignored? About the support for Greece, just like a hangman’s rope? Or the return of nationalist flames in the United Kingdom and in eastern Europe? Joking aside, Benoît Cœuré, do you live in an ivory tower in Frankfurt, or do you know things that Europeans are unaware of?   Do you know things that Europeans are unaware of?  No, we don’t know things that Europeans are unaware of. We try to do our work as best as we can, which is to ensure price stability in the euro area. And I don’t think we have to be negative about Europe. Not everything is going very well. There are plenty of things which don’t work well and which need to be improved. But what would we say to the millions of eastern Europeans who have returned to prosperity thanks to Europe, if Europe didn’t exist today? What would we say to the millions of French people who work in companies which are exporting to Europe? And when you travel round the world, Europe is admired. Why? Because it is a prosperous region, but also because it is a place of security, and of social protection. Europe is one of the few places in the world where, if you go to hospital, you won’t be asked for your credit card. That’s what we need to safeguard, but we need to safeguard it together, as Europeans.  Emmanuel Macron wants a euro area budget and greater solidarity between the Member States. Will that be achieved soon?   It’s necessary because the Member States have to regain budgetary firepower. It would not be reasonable to expect the European Central Bank to sort out all of Europe’s economic problems indefinitely. Economic capacity and budgetary capacity have to be recreated. But that won’t happen overnight; French ideas won’t be imposed on Europe by magic, it will be a long discussion. To do that, trust should be rebuilt between the countries of Europe. Trust is vital.  From a French perspective, how can that trust be re-created?  By carrying out reforms, and France is doing that.  And by reducing deficits even more?  By continuing to reduce the deficit so that debt falls and France is ready when growth slows down.  And by making further cuts in public spending?  It is not for the ECB to tell the French government what needs to be done in detail, but what we wish is for France to have the capacity to respond economically when growth slows down and for it not to depend completely on monetary policy.  "
2017-10-29,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Le Journal du Dimanche,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Bruna Basini on 27 October and published on 29 October 2017","  Interview with Le Journal du Dimanche   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Bruna Basini on 27 October and published on 29 October 2017  The reduction in liquidity decided by the ECB is so accommodative that one might wonder if it has become impossible to wean the markets off this source…  We’ve decided to halve our asset purchases. From January to September 2018 we will buy €30 billion worth of bonds per month instead of €60 billion, as at present. And our interest rates will remain unchanged. The ECB’s monetary policy will remain very accommodative: in particular, our asset purchases will continue until inflation clearly moves towards 2%. This recalibration takes account of the solidity of the recovery and allows it to gain strength. I am hopeful that this will be the last extension.  Don’t we have to fear negative effects?  We are aware that this policy could create risks on the financial markets. But its first effect is to further stimulate consumption and investment, and to support the fall in unemployment. There’s no financial bubble at euro area level. There are price tensions on real estate markets in some countries. In France, corporate debt is also rising very quickly, perhaps too quickly. But nothing at this stage demands action from the ECB.  How will this policy affect interest rates?  The ECB’s policy will enable households and firms to continue borrowing at historically low levels. The short-term rates set by the ECB are going to remain very low for quite some time, well past September 2018. As for long-term rates, they are set by the financial markets. These rates can be expected to rise as the global economic recovery proceeds. Businesses and governments must prepare for that.  Prices are not rising very much, wages even less so, whatever happened to inflation, which is levelling off at around 1.5%?  In Europe wages have tended to stand still because we’ve endured one blow after another, the financial crisis, then the euro area crisis. One young person in five is unemployed in the euro area. It’s no surprise that this affects wages. The nature of the jobs created has also changed. There are many fixed-term and part-time jobs which keep employees in a position of dependence. As the recovery takes hold, the quality of jobs will improve and allow wages to rise, but this will take time.  Are the reforms undertaken by the euro area countries going in the right direction?  It’s not the ECB’s job to give lectures. Our mandate is to protect the purchasing power of the people of Europe. Growth has returned in all the euro area countries and consumer confidence across Europe is at its highest for 16 years. The priority now is to achieve greater convergence between the countries and thus create a more resilient economic bloc. Every country must continue with its reforms: in particular France, but also Germany.  Does the economic transformation of France promised by Emmanuel Macron go far enough?  It will enable France to make up for lost time. The return of growth in Europe is offering France a unique opportunity to pursue a coherent set of reforms in order to rectify its weaknesses: persistent unemployment, inadequate training, deficits in public finance and external trade. But this is happening at a time when globalisation and technological change are creating uncertainty. More flexibility is needed, it’s true, but we shouldn’t forget those who get left behind by this model.  And the level of France’s public debt?  On the budgetary front, France still faces a predicament. Its deficit is falling, but mainly because the economy is growing again. If the economic climate changes, where will the room for manoeuvre be? It’s now high time that France, the second-largest economy in the euro area, let go of the ECB’s monetary policy.  What institutional reforms will be needed to consolidate the euro area?  That’s a matter for the heads of state and government. For a long time I have favoured the establishment of a euro area finance ministry. Provided it was given the right financial tools, this would facilitate the handling of the next crisis without having to rely excessively on the ECB, which was mainly the case these past few years. But for the ministry to come into being, a degree of trust has to be recreated between the countries. In this discussion, the reforms and the serious nature of France’s budget are a test case. Let’s also prevent the common budget from absolving governments of their budgetary responsibilities.  Would a European Monetary Fund make sense?  I am not one of those who think that Europe should get rid of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF was there when Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus were under attack. In an unstable world, the IMF is more necessary than ever. Our crisis management tool, the European Stability Mechanism, deserves to be strengthened. It could become a true European stability fund, with greater resources and an independent advisory capacity. European crises would also have to be managed in a more transparent way, involving the European Parliament more closely.  Protectionist and populist movements are gaining support among voters in Europe. How should we respond to this frustration?  Europe was a great success when it came to building the single market and the euro, and welcoming the former Communist countries. But it was unable to help workers facing globalisation and technological change. We need to take advantage of the return of growth to create a space for European rules which foster the mobility of employees, protect their rights and enable them to be educated and trained across Europe.  Why are the ECB and the national central banks ignoring bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, which are being increasingly used for trade?  We aren’t ignoring them. At the moment crypto-currencies don’t pose any monetary risk because the amounts involved are marginal. They are speculative financial instruments which create risks of a financial or even criminal nature. The central banks are following their development very closely because they can spread very rapidly, especially in countries which are moving away from banknotes and coins.  And if tomorrow the future President of the ECB was a German national, would that be a serious matter?  The nationality of the ECB’s President is irrelevant. What matters is that the person can do the job.  "
2017-09-28,Peter Praet,Interview with Les Echos,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabelle Couet and Catherine Chatignoux on 25 September and published on 29 September 2017","  Interview with Les Echos   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Isabelle Couet and Catherine Chatignoux on 25 September and published on 29 September 2017  The German election is over. In your opinion, does the result hamper the chances of reforming the euro area?  What’s important for us, beyond countries’ electoral calendars, is a stable currency and stable prices. Today, the institutional reforms needed to strengthen the euro area after this decade of crises must be successfully completed. The sovereign debt crisis of 2010-12 exposed the euro area’s weaknesses, in particular the lack of a single system of banking supervision and a collective crisis management mechanism.   In terms of European governance, what is the priority?  The priority is to finalise the banking union, in other words to truly break the bank-sovereign nexus. It is commendable that financial institutions have reduced their exposures to the public debt of their respective countries since the crisis. However, banks are still too exposed to their domestic economies. The banking union is currently still too much of a collection of national banking systems. The euro area has established a Single Supervision Mechanism for the banking sector and the basis for a Single Resolution Mechanism for distressed banks. But, in the case of public intervention, too much of the ultimate responsibility still remains at national level. A genuine Single Resolution Fund needs to be set up, without delay, at European level, to ensure the stability of Economic and Monetary Union.  In concrete terms, how do we get there?  The banking union will remain incomplete for as long as each banking subsidiary in a country is obliged to fulfil all the conditions regarding capital and liquidity. The aim of the banking union is for banks to be able to manage their balance sheets as a single entity, regardless of their location in the euro area. The strategy for getting there is a combination of reducing banking risks, in particular by strengthening regulatory requirements, and increasing the power of the Single Resolution Fund. Unfortunately, a binding timetable that would entail a fundamental reconfiguration of the European banking landscape has met with reservations. But it is key to ensuring the stability of the European banking system and the successful transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy decisions.  So do you support the creation of a European Monetary Fund?  Yes, this is the other main priority for the euro area. The idea is to manage and prevent crises more effectively. As with the European Stability Mechanism, the role of an “EMF”, or rather a European Stabilisation Fund, would be to lend money to governments under certain conditions. The key questions are: who will the decision-makers be? What role will the European Commission play? What will the governance structure look like? How much firepower will it have?  We also need to know whether we want the assistance to be provided to countries on the condition that they restructure their debt. This is what Germany’s “five wise men” want...  In general, conditionality does not entail a restructuring of the public debt, which really is a last resort. This is a topic that must be handled with great care. Let’s not forget the market reaction in 2010 when, in Deauville, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy talked of engaging investors when a government was in serious trouble.  The ideas which are currently circulating include that of a euro area budget.  The question is knowing what function to assign to a euro area budget. Personally, I think that the stabilisation function for a country facing an economic shock is appealing in terms of economic theory, but I’m sceptical at the political level. The fear is that transfers are always made in the same direction and that the taxpayers of the countries offering support do not agree with this. However, a common budget may enable public goods, such as security and defence, to be financed more efficiently. In the euro area one of the urgent problems that needs to be addressed is the insufficient real convergence of the economies. A labour market that is too rigid in certain countries may, for example, inhibit the good functioning of the monetary union. Even though it is the responsibility of individual countries to carry out the necessary structural reforms, incentive mechanisms at euro area level require careful consideration because of these external effects.   Are the Macron reforms going in the right direction?  I would say so. These reforms are very encouraging. This is no longer the policy of small steps; this time the bar has been set very high. Now the reforms need to be implemented and supported by the public. We can also pay tribute to having the courage to carry out reforms while the recovery is under way and the efforts no longer seem absolutely essential.  Would you say that the euro is now too weak for Germany, but too strong for France, Italy and the others?  Before the crisis there were marked differences in wage costs and competitiveness, in Greece in particular. These persistent differences have created serious tensions within the euro area. Macroeconomic imbalance adjustments are not made via the exchange rate in the monetary union. That’s why it’s essential that the labour market and the goods and services markets work well.   The Bank for International Settlements is worried about risks caused by monetary policies that are too accommodative. What’s your reply to that?  Our main objective is to ensure price stability. The financial crisis has created deflationary risks. Our monetary policy measures have played a key role in the economic recovery, which is necessary for inflation to gradually return to levels in line with our objective. The question is knowing whether the central bank has gone too far in its monetary policy easing. Now that the gap between growth potential and real activity is narrowing, have we accomplished our mission? At this stage, my reply is no. The economic expansion that is under way is not yet feeding through into higher inflation. We are not changing our priorities, but we must take into account the improvement in economic conditions when calibrating our measures.  Should an end date for QE be announced?  No new decision has been taken since the Governing Council meeting on 7 September. We had concluded that a very accommodative monetary policy stance would remain essential to our mission and that we would decide in the autumn on the calibration of our purchase programme for the period beyond the end of the year.

2017-09-20,Vítor Constâncio,Interview with Euronews,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Efthymia Koutsokosta on 15 September and published on 20 September","  Interview with Euronews   Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Efthymia Koutsokosta on 15 September and published on 20 September  After almost a decade of crisis and uncertainty in the Eurozone, optimism is on the rise. But still unemployment is high and divergences among member states are always there. What should be done so that the euro delivers on its promise to increase the wealth of the societies? To discuss this I am joined here by the Vice-President of the European Central Bank Mr Vitor Constancio. Mr Constancio: welcome to Global Conversation.   So, do you share this optimism, is it justified or there are risks that can really revive the crisis once again?  It's important to underline that growth has converged, meaning that the rates of growth of all countries are now very close together and that's the best situation from that point of view since the beginning of the monetary union.   But is the Eurozone still attractive for the member states? And I am saying that because after the crisis there are a lot of people saying that this currency is not designed for all, but for only a few strong member states.  We were initially eleven countries, then 12 in 2001 and then in 2007, 2011, 2014, 2015 other countries joined which shows that during the crisis there were several countries still very much attracted to the idea of the stability and the openness that the monetary union offers to all countries.   But we see some countries such as Hungary or Poland not willing to join.    I won't discuss the position of any particular country or government, it's their view but there is a presumption in the treaty - and that's what Mr Juncker highlighted in his speech - there is a presumption in the treaty that all member countries are supposed eventually to join except countries that are still members and have an opting out clause like the UK which is now leaving the EU altogether and Denmark. All the others, according to the treaty, are presumed to join one day.   There are also other proposals on the table concerning for example a minister, a finance minister of the EU or the Eurozone or a Eurozone budget. Why is a minister needed right now in the EU right now?   The idea of a finance minister is more recent and presumably is connected with the introduction of such functions at the central level of the euro area in order to have someone in charge and responsible for managing that additional capacity and the stabilization function in the monetary union.   Does this mean that the member states give some powers to this minister?  Yes of course. But already the stability and growth pact implies with all its reforms over the years, implies a lot of coordination and rules that have to be complied by the countries. That sort of sharing of sovereignty in some aspects of fiscal policy is already there and what would be now presumably at stake is the creation of some more instruments to help stabilize potential recessionary periods in the euro area in the future.   But let me tell you about EU growth. Ok, things are going better, maybe the economy goes better, maybe some wages are going up, maybe unemployment is falling but not everywhere. There are for example the countries of the South still struggling to survive with crisis, to create growth: Italy, Portugal, Greece. And we see other countries, the strongest ones which are in a better shape. How you tackle this?   Well, in the first place, all these countries that you mentioned and also Spain are growing and in the case of Spain and Portugal they are growing above the average of the euro area right now.   But people don't feel that.  Not yet. But in the first place it's being felt in the reduction of unemployment also in those countries. Growth has returned to all countries. And so, the degree of divergence has stopped, which has been ongoing since the crisis. And of course we need to strengthen these movements, and that's why at the European level we need new initiatives to deepen and strengthen the functioning of the monetary union.   What about Italy? Is Italy the sick child of the euro area? Because of course Italy is a very particular case, with a huge exposure to non-performing loans and a banking system quite vulnerable.   The main consequence of having too high non-performing loans is on profits because all those loans are not providing the revenue, so the NPL question is very important to indeed restore conditions of improved profitability so that they can then offer new credits to support the recovery.   But despite the recovery of the eurozone, all these positive messages, we have many challenges ahead. One of this is brexit. What could be the biggest risk of this negotiation, of this divorce?   In economic terms, one has to consider the size of the UK economy and the size of the EU to see that the consequences and the disruption would be much more significant for the smaller part in that negotiation than for the EU as a whole. I don't expect and no one is expecting that a brexit will mean that there would be no trade between the two parts. That won't happen. There will not be a total disappearance of trade.  Mr Constancio, you are in this position since 2010. So, you experienced the hardest times of the Eurozone. What was your personal most difficult moment?   Well, it was the start of the phase of the crisis when Greece came to a situation where the revelation about the budget deficit created a situation of non-access to the financial markets. That was in 2010.  Could you say that the end was close?   Well, I wouldn't say that especially with hindsight but during those moments, indeed it was the first big shock of the crisis. Then we had many other vicissitudes later on, some related with Greece, some related with other countries, 2015 was also a difficult moment but the beginning and the big shock and the surprise of what could imply was indeed the more difficult moment.   Mr Constancio many thanks for being with us.    "
2017-09-16,Peter Praet,Interview with De Tijd,"Interview Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Wouter Vervenne and Bart Haeck on 13 September and published on 16 September 2017","  Interview with De Tijd   Interview Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Wouter Vervenne and Bart Haeck on 13 September and published on 16 September 2017  Do you know where you were when you first realised how serious the problems were?  I was at the National Bank [of Belgium] in Brussels in a meeting with European colleagues. One colleague from the Bank of England suddenly had to leave in a hurry because there were problems with Northern Rock, where customers were lining up in the street to take out their savings. For me that was frightening. I had never thought that something like that could happen again. I remember saying to my wife at the time: I hope that we won't have a banking crisis in Belgium, because something like that goes on for a decade. The risks we were exposed to then were enormous. Fortis alone already had a balance sheet of €1 trillion then, if you include insurance. If you compared the banks' balance sheets with the GDP of Belgium, you could see how enormous the risks were. All in all we got through that period fairly well in Belgium, even if it wasn't pleasant for the shareholders and there is still a legacy from Dexia. It is just sad that the banking crisis in Europe has lasted so long.  Why exactly is it so sad?  Because it wasn't necessary. The reforms could have gone faster. That is why the costs to society are much higher than they could have been: it weighs on our growth. It took so long because we did not have the right European institutions to bring the crisis under control among other reasons. A debt crisis broke out that meant many families and businesses couldn't pay down their loans. In a situation like that debtors and creditors have to make a deal. But one group was in one European country and the others were in another European country. And we did not have European banking supervision yet. And there was no European resolution fund to make sure that a bank could fail without pulling others down with it. That made the situation very messy.  Did you see it coming? At that time you were the expert on financial stability at the National Bank of Belgium?  I was actually already giving warnings about the dotcom bubble in the '90s. That earned me the nickname Mister Doom, which I wasn't very happy about. I then became chef de cabinet to Federal Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders (MR) – I did that to get some political experience, but politics is not my thing – and left to return to the National Bank. Financial stability was really my thing. At that time I travelled to Scandinavia a lot, because in the '90s they had already had a serious banking crisis there. But what began in 2007 was much worse.  What exactly did everyone get wrong?   Back then there was very little information about how banks are interconnected and can drag each other down. At that time I was sitting in an institution that supervises the financial infrastructure, like Euroclear. By virtue of that function, one Sunday in 2008 I had a teleconference with the American central bank, the Federal Reserve. At a certain point they let me know that the discussions with Lehman Brothers had failed. ‘We couldn’t reach a deal with Lehman. Now we have to be ready.’ And that was the second shock. Then the ECB responded. It allowed the banks to borrow large amounts from it, so that they would not start selling off their assets in a panic because they needed cash. Lehman Brothers had got into trouble because of cheap subprime home loans that were no longer being repaid. But because the US subprime market is not that big from an international perspective, it was still thought at the time that the crisis could be over within six months.  That is not what happened.  Only later did we start to understand that the problem went much deeper. And I think that those who are critical of the ECB today underestimate that.  The fundamental problem was that for years we were much too optimistic about future growth. We thought that our income would continue to grow strongly and that we would continually become more productive, but we systematically overestimated that trend. The problem was that in many European countries they then began building up debts based on that over-optimism. In that way you are cashing in on the optimism with the intention of paying back later. But there's a huge problem if these expectations don't materialise.  And that was the moment when the banking crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis.  Yes. And once again it was a big shock. This time it was German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy walking on the beach at Deauville in Normandy who agreed that the investors in government bonds – among which many banks – in the future would have to share in losses. Until then the financial system took it as a given that euro area government debt was always repaid. That was why government bonds were used as safe collateral in transactions. In Deauville that 'given' was taken away.  How hard did that hit?  The interbank markets were completely frozen. Banks in countries with vulnerable government finances suddenly had problems because the sovereign bonds on their balance sheets - which they had considered safe for decades - suddenly weren't considered safe anymore by the markets. The economy of the euro area then entered a recession and downward pressure on prices occurred. That led to fears of a break-up of the euro. It was due to that shock that in 2012, at the Olympic Games in London, ECB President Mario Draghi signalled that the ECB would do 'whatever it takes' to save the euro. In the years that followed the ECB has eased its policies considerably, especially with negative rates and the purchase programmes.   Five years on it doesn't seem as if that policy is really working.  I wouldn't be so hasty. We are still working on it. The economy is growing. While the ongoing economic expansion provides confidence that inflation will gradually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, it has yet to translate sufficiently into stronger inflation dynamics. But may I remind you that at the time there was a risk of deflation? A deflation scenario would have meant that prices would fall over a long period and people would have started postponing their spending, so that the whole economy would have ended up in a negative spiral. That risk of deflation is now totally gone. But we are not there yet. You are right on that.  Why is it taking so long?  Because we are coming out of an enormous crisis. A banking crisis is one of the worst economic crises there is. Especially in a region like Europe, where businesses are mainly financed by banks rather than through financial markets. And if the creditors and debtors come from different countries too, you also have a lot of political tensions to deal with as well. In my view people don't realise how serious the crisis was. I don't think they realise that the world would have looked totally different – and dramatically worse – if central banks hadn't stepped in so forcefully.  The recent strengthening of the euro is making it even more difficult.  Our communication about the exchange rate is very careful. The Governing Council of the ECB has assessed that recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.  In the meantime criticism of the ECB's policy is growing, because your policy is also doing some damage.  I don't think that the stimulus policy itself is being attacked. I do constantly hear people asking whether it is time to start tapering though. I understand why the question is asked. Growth is back. The risk of deflation has gone. But the current economic expansion has yet to translate sufficiently into stronger inflation dynamics.  What is your answer to those who think the ECB is interpreting its objective too narrowly and in the meantime causing unnecessary problems elsewhere?  That our mandate is to ensure price stability. And the ECB defined 'price stability' in 2003 as 'close to two percent inflation in the medium term'.  Many people looking for the cheapest product while out shopping would probably be happy if inflation was a mere half a percent. Why push so hard to get to two percent?  Because it is very important to be credible. If everyone is confident that our objective is just under two percent inflation, then this is included in contracts and especially in wage negotiations, for example. Already now we are seeing some wage negotiations taking place based on the lower inflation rate and not on our almost two percent. This shows that 'inflation expectations' are still fragile.  But why ""almost two percent""?   Imagine if we defined price stability as zero percent inflation in the euro area. That would mean prices would be rising in some euro area countries, but falling in some other euro area countries. It would mean that as soon as some products became more expensive, the prices of others would have to fall. Otherwise you cannot achieve an average of zero. Imagine if we defined price stability as one percent: that would mean we would have hardly any scope to reduce the interest rate and intervene if there was a downturn. Our margin of safety would then be too small. If you look at it from a long-term perspective, there are very good reasons to aim for close to two percent. It's legitimate to have this debate. But anyone who thinks we should be happy with zero percent inflation because we will otherwise destabilise the financial system is underestimating the importance of aiming for close to two percent inflation.   But in the meantime the dangers of cheap money for the financial system are here, aren't they?  I don't deny that the longer central banks pursue this accommodative monetary policy, the greater the risk of bubbles. We are monitoring this but in the euro area as a whole there are no bubbles, although in some cities real estate has become very expensive, for example. But this possible disadvantage is too slight to justify changing our policy.  Why?   If real estate were to become too expensive, you could also address this with other, more specific measures. In Belgium, for example, the National Bank is responsible for such policies. And furthermore families in certain European cities pay a lot for property, but borrow relatively little in order to do so. So the link with cheap credit is not always equally clear. So yes, there are side effects, but we think they are manageable.  Is there a bubble forming in the equity markets?   If you look at the United States equities appear to be quite expensive. I don't see that in Europe. Share prices may be rising due to low interest rates, but they are also increasing because the profit prospects of the firms are increasing. Don't get me wrong: I am not an equity analyst. I am not saying that European equities are cheap or too expensive. I am just saying that at the moment they do not give rise to any concerns about financial stability in the euro area. That would be the case if, for example, many people were borrowing short-term in order to invest in shares. That would be worrying.  Another side effect is that savers are not earning any interest anymore.  What worries me the most about that is the cultural aspect. Parents can no longer explain the time effect of money to their children. They can no longer show them that spending today and spending tomorrow don't happen at the same price. I don't think it is good for children to get the impression that they should spend today rather than tomorrow because the interest rate is negative. The experiences and references this creates are not OK. This worries me, but again: we have to make choices.  Will low interest rates lead to a zombie economy? Will unproductive firms, which should actually go under, survive due to cheap loans?  Are we delaying the process of creative destruction by providing cheap money? That's a fair question. We are monitoring this. If you take a macroeconomic perspective, you can see that on average firms have become more resilient and stronger. The problem is that this average can mask large differences. For that reason we are now looking at firms' balance sheets 'bottom up' - the IMF does this too. That is the only way we can simulate - firm by firm - whether they can survive a large rise in interest expenses following an ECB rate increase. We see great progress in countries like Spain, but more needs to be done.  But the incentive to reduce debt, whether for firms or governments, is small. These debts aren't costing them anything, at the moment.  In general remarkable efforts have been made in the last years. Nevertheless some firms but also governments are delaying restructuring. Sometimes we have the feeling that we are 'the only game in town' and that the others are not doing their job sufficiently. But how can we be held responsible for others' lack of courage?  But isn't it still a fact that the ECB is buying time and a breathing space, but the euro area governments are not making enough use of this breathing space to implement reforms?  This sort of reasoning is dangerous. The ECB is an institution that was given its mandate – to keep prices stable – and our independence also means that we decide on our policies on the basis of our mandate, not on the basis of other considerations.   What can you do then?  Warn people. We send a clear message that we take our task seriously. This means that as soon as inflation threatens to increase above our objective, we will intervene just as forcefully in order to prevent that happening too. We will not hesitate to do that, even if it means that interest rates will increase and those with a lot of debt are going to feel it.  Do economic problems keep you awake at night?  I have been worried about things all my life, eventually you get used to it.  But what worries you the most?  I am most worried about the governments that are reforming too slowly. In some European countries structural reforms are really needed. Yesterday I was in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron's reform of the labour law is impressive. What is very good is that there is broad support for it. But we now have to see how it will work in practice. There is still a lot of work to do, also elsewhere in Europe.  Has the time come for the ECB to taper its stimulus?  Not yet, we are saying. This autumn we will decide on our policy for next year. I will not say much about that now. Thanks to the very strong economic growth we are more and more confident that inflation will increase towards our objective. But underlying inflation remains too low. We have to be patient and persevere with our policy. A substantial stimulus is still necessary. Everyone agrees that we have to make sure that the reduction of the stimulus takes place in an orderly manner, without any excessive shocks.  Is that going to be possible?  We will have to handle it very carefully. And we will have to be very careful about the words we use. Actually monetary policy pretty much comes down to trying to influence other people's expectations of the future. It is a quiet and difficult exercise in mass psychology. The best example is the impact of the three words Mario Draghi said: 'whatever it takes'. That is why I have to continue to press home that we will stick to our mandate. I'm an extreme 'hawk' in that regard. I know that some people describe me as a 'dove', who prefers a more accommodative monetary policy. That's why I am clearly saying this: we will stick to our mandate, symmetrically. If inflation becomes too high, we will react just as ruthlessly as we are now in order to get inflation back on track.  When can savers dream of getting a return on their money again?  You have to realise that there is a reason for the current low interest rates. Apart from that, one has to measure return in real terms, in other words corrected for inflation. These real interest rates were low before the crisis as well and sometimes negative. Unfortunately it’s mostly economists who understand that; most other people don't. Also I hear very few complaints from people who are renewing a mortgage at a low rate and are now paying off their house more cheaply. Even though you sometimes hear the same people complaining afterwards that they are not earning anything on their savings. It is true that some groups are affected by our policy. Pensioners who rent their home and have a lot of savings are clearly feeling the effects. But helping to cushion that blow is a job for governments.  But when will there be a return on savings again?  Once we can return to a normal policy. So, when there is a sustainable return to an inflation below but close to 2%. Our policy is working and we see a light at the end of the tunnel. And it isn't the lights of a train rushing towards us, as some people jokingly say. But as to when: it will take time. Don't forget that we have always confirmed that we will first stop purchasing bonds and only then consider raising interest rates. Patience is needed.  "
2017-09-12,Benoît Cœuré,Europe’s moment,"Opinion piece by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, published by Börsen-Zeitung, 12 September 2017","  Europe’s moment   Opinion piece by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, published by Börsen-Zeitung, 12 September 2017 Globalisation and international cooperation experienced a backlash last year. In Europe, the EU and its four freedoms were called into question. Since then, higher growth, falling unemployment and better economic prospects have noticeably helped to improve attitudes towards the EU. According to the latest Eurobarometer, for example, more than two out of three Europeans now regard themselves as citizens of the EU – the highest level ever achieved for this indicator. Support for the euro has also reached a record high, and an increasing number of Europeans are optimistic about the future of the EU. This change of mood is also evident in election results: in several EU Member States anti-European forces have suffered resounding defeats in recent months. A new feeling of unity and confidence seems to be spreading across the continent, buoyed up by a joint commitment to democracy and to the values of an open and free society. A new Franco-German initiative is raising the hopes of many people that the European project, after years of stagnation, will make tangible progress. We should and must use this moment to help Europe make further progress. If we don’t, the EU’s economic and social cohesion could sooner or later be at risk again. So it’s time for Europe to seize this favourable opportunity – and to make it into Europe’s moment. The reason for acting is obvious: despite the encouraging change of mood, people’s basic fears of an open economy and the EU have certainly not faded. But the EU can give an answer to the fears threatening them – provided the decision-makers are willing to draw the right conclusions from the crisis. Three basic concerns are unsettling people about globalisation and open markets.  The first one has to do with stability – whether globalisation has made countries more vulnerable to spillovers and international financial crises. From the end of the Second World War until 1980 around 1% of countries worldwide, on average, experienced a banking crisis in any one year. From 1980 to 2008 the figure was 20%. The second concern is about fairness. Are all countries playing by the same rules and applying the same standards? This concern is evident worldwide, for example, in relation to dumping or races to the bottom. Concerns have also arisen in Europe about the free movement of labour. The third concern is about whether society is just. Many people think that open markets have favoured capitalists and the rich at the expense of workers and the poor. And indeed, as the OECD has shown, over the last 20 years, the wage share in rich countries has increased by 20% for the top 1%, but it has fallen for the remaining 99% of income earners.  Of course, some of these concerns are based more on perception than on fact. Increased sensitivity to financial shocks or widening income gaps, for example, might be attributable to a number of factors, including technological change. But a rising number of empirical studies suggests that globalisation is likely to have reinforced some of the secular trends that have caused people to view economic integration with growing scepticism and, at times, anxiety.  There are therefore two ways of reacting to these challenges: withdrawing within national borders or going for a joint multinational solution. The first option is destined to fail for two reasons. First, it deprives people of the undisputed economic advantages that trade and integration bring. Second, globalisation leads to some countries, however much they may isolate themselves, having fewer policy instruments available with which they can react to the challenges of globalisation.  As globalisation provides, for instance, scope for arbitrage between jurisdictions, it also makes it harder to regulate and supervise financial markets and to prevent crises from recurring. And as it makes the tax base more footloose, it weakens governments’ ability to generate the funds needed to support incomes and retrain people who have lost their jobs because of global competition.  This is where the EU, a microcosm of globalisation, offers a solution to people’s fears and concerns. This is the second option. The EU can return control over globalisation to a polity by ensuring that policies better match its economic borders. It gives its Member States a unique platform for recovering some of the state functions that were dismantled by globalisation. Take concerns about stability. Although the EU, and the euro area in particular, was hit by a major financial crisis and fragmentation, its response was to establish new and better institutions for the European market, notably through the banking union. By better aligning our political and economic borders it became possible to reverse fragmentation and protect taxpayers better – something that, despite the best efforts of the Basel Committee, cannot be achieved at global level.  And wherever agreement could be achieved at global level – especially in the reform of international financial regulation – the EU is vigorously in favour. The EU has always been committed to preserving financial and economic stability by respecting jointly agreed rules and values. There will be no backtracking and no regulatory race to the bottom.  The same applies to concerns about fairness.  In the EU Member States, the single rulebook, enforced by European courts, provides the strongest possible assurance that competition is fair. There are even strong positive externalities involved: since businesses exporting to the EU must meet its standards, economies of scale incentivise them to apply EU standards to their entire production chain. This is known as the “Brussels effect”. Rather than allowing globalisation to become an inevitable race to the bottom, the EU, with its regulatory power, can actually trigger a global race to the top. This can only be good for globalisation in the long run. With regard to a just society and the distribution effects of the open market, these aspects pose problems above all for national social systems. But the EU can play a role here too.  Knowing that no large corporation – not even a giant like Apple – can threaten to completely turn their back on the world’s largest market, the Commission is already deploying competitive instruments to counter, for instance, tax arbitrage by multinational companies. With the proposed Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base tax avoidance by profit shifting within Europe could be eliminated.  In other words, for all its flaws, the EU is of real benefit to its Member States in a globalised world. It represents the most progressive model we have for addressing people’s doubts about open markets and fair competition – doubts that individual countries on their own cannot dispel.  In the future, this means two things.  First, we need to constantly review the fitness of our existing institutions for dealing with common, global challenges. Despite laudable progress, the economic, social and legal frameworks for households and businesses in all the Member States could be considerably improved. We should not mistakenly assume that the current recovery will heal all wounds. By making our institutions fit for purpose, we will help the Member States to make the recovery sustainable, exploit their comparative advantages, increase their resilience to shocks and allow them to maximise prosperity by way of the single market. Second, we should not wait any longer, as we did with the banking union, to have a more serious debate about deeper integration and new institutions. It is needed, above all, to protect the integrity of the EU and of the euro area in particular.  For a united Europe to achieve better outcomes in tackling common, global challenges, progress on two fronts – a commitment to strengthening our existing institutions and a clear vision for further integration – is necessary. In doing so, we would also keep the promise we made when the EU was founded, namely that it would bring prosperity and opportunities. It is encouraging to see European leaders gradually taking up these pressing issues. The discussion must now lead to concrete results so that this really can be Europe’s moment.  "
2017-09-01,Yves Mersch,The role of cash: Customer retention and tie to the citizen,"Contribution by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, 1 September 2017","  The role of cash: Customer retention and tie to the citizen   Contribution by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, 1 September 2017 There is much talk about the demise of cash. But to paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of its death are an exaggeration. Cash remains popular. A crucial point for banks to understand, since respecting clients’ needs and wishes is a precondition to ensuring their loyalty and support. This not only applies to the relationship between private banks and their clients, but also between central banks and the public, where cash provides a tangible daily link. I will discuss each in turn. Private banks: cash is a means of customer retention The banking sector is confronted with low profitability as well as high and increasing competition from other banks and non-banking start-ups, so-called fin-techs. In this environment, customer retention is pivotal to staying in business: if your customer is not satisfied, he most likely will not stay your customer. Therefore, it is important to ensure that customers’ interactions with banks can be carried out in a way that satisfies the customers the most.  Take the use of cash and the growing shift to newer payment systems. There is a wide and ever increasing supply of non-cash payment systems available, such as credit cards, electronic payments, portable wallets and mobile phone payments to name but a few. As more people adapt to new payment options, banks’ established business models can be disrupted. Banks need to remain agile and endeavour to meet their customers’ evolving desires. In this context, some see major business opportunities arising from abolishing cash, by eliminating the high storage, issuance, and handling costs that the financial industry currently faces. Customers would benefit, too, as they would no longer need to carry wads of cash or search for ATMs.  But this assumed increase in convenience would come at a cost. There are a wide range of legal, governance and operational questions that need to be considered carefully before switching away from cash. Just as cash has a number of technological safeguards to protect from counterfeiting, innovative payment systems require significant safeguards to protect individuals from theft and from loss of personal information. That protection of personal information extends to ensuring the ability of law-abiding citizens to maintain their anonymity and addressing legitimate concerns surrounding the use of Big Data for personal profiling. Most importantly, empirical evidence suggests that the lobbying to abolish cash fails to respect the will of the people: cash remains popular. Recent research for the ECB finds that 80% of transactions at point of sale are in cash. Even adjusting for the value of transactions, cash still accounts for the majority. Indeed, the demand for cash currently outstrips the growth in nominal GDP. Banks should see such developments as a positive opportunity to engage with customers, without actively pushing them away from cash where it remains their preference. Enabling customers to manage their finances in the manner that most appeals to them encourages loyalty and supports customer retention.  Central banks: cash is a link to the citizen Central banks face similar questions. They are confronted with proposals to abolish cash and replace it by digital variants. But this, too, has implications for their relationship with their ultimate clients – the general public. Central banks have issued cash since their inception. For cash to carry out its roles as a medium of exchange and store of value, the public has to have trust in its integrity. And for monetary policy to be effective, trust in the central bank and support by the citizens is required.  To maintain that integrity and protect the currency from counterfeiters, central banks have not only adopted innovations at the cutting edge of printing technology, but actively driven innovation in that area. The ECB’s recent €50 note – issued earlier this year – is no exception, incorporating an enhanced range of security features.  But the technological developments mentioned earlier have also encouraged more radical ideas, including the abolition of cash. Some argue in favour of overcoming the restrictions on monetary policy arising from the zero lower bound, others aim at undermining illicit activities by eliminating their preferred means of payment. I am sceptical about these arguments.  First, central banks worldwide implemented various unconventional measures during the past decade which were effective in meeting the challenges of low inflation. Negative nominal interest rates have worked, without triggering a flight to cash, especially when combined with other unconventional measures. Still, while it might be feasible to set extreme negative rates in a theoretical model, I wonder how the public would react. Not only would such rates be deeply unpopular, there may be unintended changes in behaviour that would dampen their effectiveness.  As the Bank for International Settlements recently found, there seems to be an independent role for nominal interest rates in the transmission process, regardless of the level of real rates. Monetary policy transmission could be weakened by the headwinds that may arise in the aftermath of balance sheet recessions. Likewise, inherent non-linearities could kick in when interest rates are persistently low and may dampen their impact on spending. The law-and-order case for banning cash also wilts under scrutiny. By acting as a store of value and a means of payment, cash fulfills an important social function for many honest citizens. Would anyone suggest forbidding cell phones because criminals use them? Harming the law-abiding majority in order to punish a misbehaving minority is a step too far.  Last but not least, cash is the only central bank liability available to the public. Digital claims against central banks already exist – commercial banks and some other types of institutions hold them in the form of deposits. But private citizens have no access to them. Although electronic payments provided by the financial industry are used by private customers, these methods are based on commercial bank money. From the perspective of the citizen, a liability vis-à-vis the central bank is more valuable than one vis-à-vis a commercial bank, not least because of the different credit risks. Bank deposits and other commercial bank liabilities are highly protected, but they are not absolutely risk-free. A central bank, however, can never become illiquid and can always honour its liabilities.  Cash therefore maintains a tangible link between the general public and the central bank, a tie which is important for maintaining trust between the two.  But cash could be digitalised, too, given recent technological advances such as the Distributed Ledger Technology, or DLT, a variant of which is used for Bitcoin. Central banks could stop issuing cash and shift to just providing an electronic claim on the central bank. In principle, the introduction of central bank-issued digital currency or digital base money (DBM), as I have called it, would be much easier and potentially less expensive than ten years ago.  But the challenges go beyond the technological sphere. Would DBM involve each individual having an account at the central bank, or instead a decentralised system where each individual has an electronic wallet and the central bank is unaware of transactions that take place? Either solution could be implemented using distributed ledger technologies, but the set-up would be quite different in each scenario. A further important question is whether DBM would be remunerated (as excess central bank reserves held by commercial banks currently are) or not, like cash. Either option has implications for household behaviour. Should DBM not be remunerated and the deposit facility rate be negative, as it is now, commercial banks may try to circumvent the regulations by setting up non-bank subsidiaries, which could in turn affect the efficacy of monetary policy. In any case, DBM would require significant safeguards to protect individuals from theft and from loss of personal information. In addition, any potential DBM solution needs be assessed against some high level principles, including: (1) technological safety, (2) efficiency, (3) technological neutrality and (4) freedom of choice for users of means of payments.  The different options have potential impacts – both positive and negative – that need to be studied and considered carefully. Only when the best way of designing DBM has been identified, can it be decided if DBM for non-banks should be introduced at all. The most important question for the ECB is whether introducing DBM would affect our ability to honour our mandate. Adopting untried technology that ultimately proves unreliable could seriously endanger public trust in the currency and in the central bank. Conclusions There are valid reasons for maintaining cash, from the perspective of commercial banks and central banks alike.  Given the widespread desire to use cash, banks should facilitate rather than obstruct customers in using their preferred method of payment. Time will tell how the use of cash will evolve once instant payments are introduced in the near future. For central banks, cash is a tool to build trust. Cash provides the general public with direct access to central bank money. For an independent institution like the ECB, maintaining that link is important, which is why we place great emphasis on ensuring people’s continued trust in cash.   "
2017-08-23,Vítor Constâncio,Investment and Growth in Advanced Economies: Selected Takeaways from the ECB’s Sintra Forum,"Contribution of Vítor Constâncio, Philipp Hartmann and Peter McAdam for VoxEU","  Investment and growth in advanced economies: selected takeaways from the ECB’s Sintra Forum   Contribution of Vítor Constâncio, Philipp Hartmann and Peter McAdam for VoxEU  The European Central Bank’s 2017 Sintra Forum on Central Banking built a bridge from the currently strengthening recovery in Europe to longer-term growth issues for and structural change in advanced economies. In this column the organisers highlight some of the main points from the discussions, including what the sources of weak productivity and investment are and what type of economic polarisation tendencies the new growth model seems to be associated with.  This year’s ECB Sintra Forum on Central Banking focused on the major real economy developments that surround and interact with monetary policy. Policymakers, academics and market economists debated on the topics of innovation, investment and productivity as well as business cycles, growth and associated policies. In this post we summarise six of the main themes that were keenly discussed in Sintra in June 2017: explaining the global productivity slowdown; the implications of technical progress for employment; explaining the laggard post-crisis recovery; sources of weak investment; the complementarity between demand and supply policies; and relevant aspects of the broader societal context. The full set of papers, discussions and speeches can be found on the Sintra Forum website while video recordings of all sessions are on the ECB’s YouTube channel.  Explaining the productivity slowdown: techno-pessimism, fading research effort or mismeasurement? “Perhaps the most remarkable fact about economic growth in recent decades is the slowdown in productivity growth that occurred around the year 2000,” said Chad Jones (2017) in motivating his Sintra contribution. This phenomenon, which has affected many advanced economies, has been widely argued for a number of years and may have become more pronounced following the financial crisis (e.g. OECD 2015, Adler et al. 2017). Jones suggests studying the sources of this slowdown via the two main forces that explain productivity in modern growth theory: innovation and the misallocation of production factors. Regarding the latter, Jones (2017) reports key results of the literature that associates the dispersion of marginal products of the same factors across firms in the US and in Europe with degrees of misallocation (e.g. Gopinath et al. 2017, highlighting deteriorating factor allocation in Italy and Spain). A recent paper by Bils et al. (2017) suggests, however, that if one corrects for measurement error, the entire increase of allocative inefficiency in US manufacturing since the late 1970s disappears. It may therefore be advisable to wait until measurement errors are also accounted for in the literature on non-manufacturing sectors and on Europe before drawing clear-cut conclusions.  Regarding innovation Jones argues that their contribution can either be driven by the impact of new ideas and processes on total factor productivity (“ideas TFP”) or the research effort pushing new ideas (such as the number of researchers employed). Gordon (2016), for example, suggested for the US that ideas with the same productivity benefits are harder to discover today than in history. Jones – in joint work with Bloom, Van Reenen and Webb (2017) – finds that this is a rather general phenomenon across different sectors and products, detecting significant reductions in “ideas TFP”. Over many decades, however, this was compensated by over-proportionate increases in research effort. As research employment growth has slowed down since the early 2000s – mostly in Japan, significantly in the US and to a lesser extent in the European Union (see Figure 1) – the phenomenon has become more harmful today than it used to be. This can explain the productivity slowdown and is consistent with Gordon’s thesis. But it puts the emphasis on ways on how to maintain a sufficiently high research effort.   Figure 1. Development of research efforts     Note: The lines show the logarithms of the total number of researchers (in 1,000s), so that their slopes reflect growth rates. The text insertions show annual growth rates for two sub-periods, respectively.  Source: Reproduced from Jones (2017), Chart 4, who uses OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators. On historical grounds, Joel Mokyr (2017) challenged the view that it is the nature of today’s innovations that accounts for the productivity slowdown and staged a forceful rebuttal of “techno-pessimism”. First, economists’ primary measures of innovation – estimations of total factor productivity and counting of patents – both underestimate their productivity effects. Second, in history humans have overcome the fact that the technological fruits that can still be picked are hanging higher and higher through building “taller and taller ladders”. This “arboreal metaphor” illustrates a feedback from technology to science. The technological tools detected over centuries that made that possible included the telescope, the microscope, the eudiometer or, more recently, x-ray crystallography. Two prominent and powerful tools today are laser technology and computers. The “hot technology of the day” is machine learning – according to Hal Varian (2017) – and quantum computing is on the way. So, Mokyr does not see why the growth in economic welfare should slow down for technological reasons. In this context, it was interesting that an online poll showed that 72% of voting Sintra participants felt that the productivity gains from the ICT (information and communication technology) revolution will accelerate, given that its full potential has not emerged yet. Reinhilde Veugelers (2017) added that it is diffusion that makes innovation such a powerful growth engine. She referred to recent evidence produced by the OECD suggesting that the diffusion and adoption of the latest technology across firms may be more of a problem than a lack of innovation as such (Andrews et al. 2015). (This point had already been much emphasised by Mario Draghi and Catherine Mann at the 2015 ECB Sintra Forum; see Constâncio et al. 2015.) She reckoned that the most potent mechanism for the transfer of new know-how is when the innovating researchers move from frontier firms to other sectors or firms. In addition to Mokyr, several other speakers also considered measurement problems affecting productivity assessments, e.g. through the underestimation of GDP (the numerator of aggregate productivity measures). Jones (2017) and Varian (2017) referred to software or services provided for free or at very low prices by ICT firms or not-for-profit institutions (e.g., Facebook, Google or Wikipedia). The problems are particularly pronounced in areas involving rapid quality change, such as photography, the global positioning system (GPS) or, more generally, the smartphones in which these and many other applications are embedded. At zero or near-zero prices, hedonic quality adjustments in nominal national accounts are difficult. Recent literature, such as Byrne et al. (2016) or Syverson (2017), however, argues that the “free” services and other ICT features only account for a small part of the productivity slowdown in the US. Based on the practice of statistical agencies to impute value developments of disappearing products from value developments of surviving products, Philippe Aghion presented in Sintra sizeable growth underestimation for France and the US, amounting to slightly more than half a percentage point of measured annual growth (see Aghion et al. 2017b for the US). But Jones (2017) points out that the authors do not find a substantial change over time, which would be required to provide an explanation for the measured productivity slowdown around 2000.  All this led to a debate about the relative roles of the private and the public sector in innovation. Reinhilde Veugelers (2017, Chart 1) showed that the European Union is particularly weak in business research and development (R&D; constituting only about 1% of GDP) relative to major advanced and emerging economies, having even fallen behind China over the last decade. Chad Jones (2017, Chart 3) showed that after large contributions in the late 1950s and 1960s, government R&D has become much less important in US intellectual property investments over the last decades. This evidence led Simon Johnson (2017) to identify the government as “a primary culprit” for the US losing its world technological leadership and the growth and employment that went along with it. He called for increased public spending on basic scientific research and the creation of new technology clusters, based on local expertise and specialisation, and co-funded by the federal government. Mariana Mazzucato promoted mission-directed government investments in innovation (one example being the US Apollo programme of the 1960s and early 1970s), which “co-shape and co-create markets” and benefit from patient long-term strategic financing (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017). She was sceptical of indirect forms of financing, such as tax advantages, which may enhance profits without necessarily ensuring “additionality”. Dietmar Harhoff (2017) concurred that the preferential treatment of intellectual property, such as “patent boxes”, amounted to beggar-thy-neighbour policies with little positive impact on innovation. Does technical progress create or destroy jobs? One of the fundamental tenets of growth theory, underlined by the discussion summarised in the previous section, is that technical progress makes long-term per capita growth possible in equilibrium (Solow 1956, 1957). But recently concerns have arisen that the technical advances of our times may be particularly destructive in replacing jobs (the dystopian variant of techno-pessimism, according to Joel Mokyr (2017)). David Autor and Anna Salomons (2017) forcefully argue that this has not been the case in history, despite such concerns having emerged periodically over the last 200 years. Covering 19 advanced economies between 1970 and 2007, they find that productivity growth has been mildly positive for aggregate employment. Their country-industry panel regressions suggest that – over long periods of time – the negative effect of productivity growth on employment in the same industry is more than compensated by positive “spillovers” in terms of expansions in other industries. Thus, structural change triggered by technical progress, ultimately, creates more employment in new sectors than it destroys in old ones.  Does this pattern change over time? Figure 2, taken from Autor and Salomons’ (2017) Sintra paper, compares the estimated own (“internal”) industry effects, the external effects on (or spillovers to) other industries and the net effects for four different decades. In line with the pooled results, the internal effects are consistently negative and the external effects consistently positive. In the 2000s, however, the positive external effects are so small that the net effects turn negative. Whether this means a reversal of the historical pattern is open to debate. The authors indicate that as early as in the 1980s negative and positive effects were basically cancelling each other out but strong positive spillovers returned in the 1990s. Moreover, preliminary follow-up work with a different database going up until 2014 seems to suggest that another recovery of the benign productivity-employment relationship may have emerged (though these results could be subject to change). Ultimately, only the future will tell. Indeed, another online survey showed that participants of the Sintra Forum were divided on this issue. 43% of voters indicated that technological innovation will have an insignificant impact on employment in the next 10 years. 28% felt that the net impact would be positive and an equal share that it would be negative.  Figure 2. Effects of productivity on employment     Note: The bars show cumulative percentage employment changes for four sub-periods as predicted by productivity growth in five sectors (utilities, mining and construction; manufacturing; education and health; high-tech services; and low-tech services) from estimating equation (7) in Autor and Salomons (2017) as reported in their Table 8. “Internal effect” describes the effect of industry productivity changes on employment in the same industries. “External effect” describes the effect of industry productivity changes on employment in all other industries. “Total effect” is the net effect of these two. The sample comprises 19 industrial countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia) and covers, for most of the countries, the period between 1970 and 2007. Productivity is gross output per worker. Predictions for the 1970s and 2000s are scaled up to be comparable to the 1980s and 1990s.   Source: Reproduced from Autor and Salomons (2017), Figure 7. Interestingly, the historical productivity-employment nexus is quite different across sectors. For example, the strongest positive employment spillovers originate from productivity growth in low-tech services (capturing e.g. car sales, real estate, hotels and catering or social and personal services). Significantly positive spillovers also emerge from high-tech services (e.g. telecommunication and financial intermediation) as well as health and education. Autor and Salomons do not find significant external effects of other sectors. More worrying, however, are their results on the effects of productivity growth on the composition of labour demand. They find clear evidence of “polarisation” in the group of 19 advanced economies in that most new jobs were – on average – created for highly skilled employees, whereas jobs for medium or low-skilled workers grew slowly (see Figure 3).   Figure 3. Effects of productivity on employment by skill group     Note: The lines show cumulative average changes in employment shares for three skill groups as predicted by productivity growth in the same five sectors as listed in the note to Figure 2 from estimating equation (8) in Autor and Salomons (2017) as reported in their Table 9. The sample comprises the same 19 industrial countries as listed in the note to Figure 2. Productivity is gross output per worker.   Source: Reproduced from Autor and Salomons (2017), Figure 8. Explaining the slow post-crisis recovery: demand or supply? While slower productivity advances may have been weighing on economic growth since the early 2000s, it cannot explain why recoveries towards potential growth were so weak and slow. Bob Hall (2017) tries to identify sources of stagnation tendencies in his Sintra paper by looking at developments in real earnings per member of the population in six major advanced economies (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States) between 2000 and 2014. He regards this as a particularly suitable metric, because it measures the well-being of a majority of populations. In the seven years following the start of the financial crisis, Germany in particular but also France appear to have experienced little stagnation, with positive annual growth rates of labour earnings. The most stagnating economies were Italy and Spain with negative annual growth rates of almost 2%, whereas the UK and the US saw more moderate stagnation.  Hall suggests assessing the plausibility of factors explaining stagnation tendencies by decomposing real earnings per capita into seven components (the labour share of total income, multifactor productivity, the capital-output ratio, hours per worker, the employment rate, the labour-force participation rate and the ratio of working-age population to total population). Table 1, taken from his paper, shows the annual growth rates for five of these components between 2007 and 2014. First of all, the many green (favourable, mostly positive values) cells in the first row illustrate the relatively positive developments for German workers. Second, the declining labour share in total income (see first column “Share”) is a broad-based international problem, which Hall characterised as “the hot topic in quantitative macroeconomics”. (Not only is it present in the US, many European countries and Japan but also in China; see Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014), Figures II and III, and Hall 2017, Figure 2). Third, protracted unemployment weighs particularly on labour earnings in Southern Europe (“Employment rate” column). The primary stagnation factor in France is the labour share while in the UK it is productivity. Finally, the single red (negative value) cell in the last column (“Participation”) suggests that declining labour market participation is a problem that is very much in evidence in the US.   Table 1. Development of stagnation factors after 2007     Note: Numbers in the cells show the average annual growth rates of five components of real labour earnings per member of the population between 2007 and 2014. “Share” stands for the labour share of total income, “Productivity” for multifactor productivity, “Hours/week” for weekly hours per worker, “Employment rate” for the share of workers in the labour force and “Participation” for the share of people of working age in the total population. Green cells highlight favourable growth rates (usually positive) and red cells unfavourably large negative growth rates. The strength of the colour reflects the degree to which the respective growth rate is favourable or unfavourable.  Source: Reproduced from Hall (2017), Table 9. From the large diversity across countries and labour income components, Hall (2017) finds it implausible that “unitary theories” of stagnation can explain these empirical facts. Rather, each country seems to have its own story, involving particular patterns of factor shares, productivity growth, unemployment, labour supply and demographics. Moreover, many of the key factors are not of a cyclical nature and therefore cannot be effectively cured with expansionary monetary policy. Instead, some of them belong to supply components, such as labour participation or productivity, to which policy attention should turn, in Hall’s view.  Gauti Eggertsson (2017) challenged this, based on a different reading of the facts. Referring to a host of previous papers, he argued that New Keynesian secular stagnation theory can make a valuable contribution to understanding the slow post-crisis recovery. First, the financial crisis may have involved an aggregate demand shock that lowered the real natural rate of interest, so that the effective lower bound of interest rates prevented central banks from exercising enough monetary policy stimulus. The resulting low inflation and growth in the euro area, the UK and the US would go hand-in-hand with sub-par labour income growth. Second, the effect of the crisis may have been asymmetric in the euro area, with Germany being less negatively affected. So, the common ECB monetary policy may have been consistent with the full utilisation of labour inputs in Germany, in Eggertsson’s view, but insufficiently expansionary for Italy or Spain. Third, Eggertsson was not convinced that divergent labour market or productivity outcomes could not be explained by demand factors as well. For example, different labour market institutions could lead to different degrees of “labour rationing” across countries. Moreover, if innovation is endogenous hysteresis effects of a demand-led recession could lead to a protracted slowdown in productivity (e.g. Garga and Singh 2016).  An online survey suggested that 36% of voting Sintra participants thought that mostly aggregate demand and 18% that mostly declining supply trends were responsible for the slow economic recovery. Interestingly, 38% pointed to a protracted debt overhang that affects deleveraging and demand. The relatively favourable labour income developments in Germany prompted several Sintra participants to offer their own explanations. Volker Wieland explained that the phenomenon started before the financial crisis, around 2005, when the lagged effects of previous massive tax reductions, labour market reforms and a focus of the unions on job security rather than wage growth healed Germany’s economy – at the time “the sick man of Europe”. Thereafter, Germany developed a low-wage services sector that hurt productivity through a composition effect but at the same time greatly expanded employment. In other words, it was an example of a supply-side policy that created demand, supporting Bob Hall’s conclusions. In a similar vein, Michael Burda added that Germany increased labour force participation via part-time work arrangements. Since total hours worked hardly changed, this acted like work sharing. There was an increase in wage dispersion but little movement in wage levels. Workers had to accept this due to the labour market reforms, which cut unemployment benefits and their duration, and thereby increased incentives through replacement rates (the ratio of unemployment income and expected income when employed). All not a miracle, Burda said, just neoclassical economics working the right way. Investment gap? The roles of product market competition and intangibles One of the distinct features of the deep and long recession caused by the twin (financial and sovereign debt) crises and the slow recovery in Europe has been weak investment. Thomas Philippon, in collaboration with Robin Döttling and Germán Gutiérrez (2017b), explored the causes of this phenomenon, comparing primarily a group of eight euro area countries with the United States. They first establish a number of stylised facts: 1) the corporate investment rate was low in both the euro area and the US, with the share of intangibles (investment in intellectual property such as computer software and databases or research and development) increasing and the share of machinery and equipment decreasing; 2) corporate profits were low in the euro area and relatively high in the US; 3) Tobin’s Q (e.g. Tobin 1969) was relatively low in the euro area – explaining corporate investment well (in particular if one excludes Italy and Spain) – and relatively high in the US but underpredicting investment there. The latter finding – that there is an “investment gap” at the aggregate level in the US but not in Europe – is displayed in Figure 4, where in the upper panel the dashed red line tracks investment rather well and in the lower panel investment is lower than what Q would predict.  Figure 4. Explanation of investment with Tobin’s Q Panel a. Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands    Panel b. The United States     Note: The lines in both panels show the measured net investment rate of the non-financial corporate sector and the net investment rate predicted by a regression of net investment on the lag of Tobin’s Q. The vertical axis is in fractions. Net investment is measured as gross fixed capital formation scaled by the lagged stock of fixed assets (“gross investment rate”) minus gross fixed capital consumption (i.e. depreciation). Tobin’s Q is measured as the market value of equity plus total liabilities minus financial assets divided by the sum of the stock of produced and non-produced assets (which includes tangible and intangible capital). The “euro area” in Panel a. comprises only five countries for data limitations and since Italy and Spain have been excluded because the relationship between investment and Q is different for them.  Source: Reproduced from Döttling, Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017), Chart 11. As is well known, Tobin’s Q is defined as the market value of a firm’s assets (typically measured by its equity price) divided by its accounting value or replacement costs. Under certain assumptions, it should capture the main economic fundamentals determining investment. Therefore, Döttling, Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017b) infer from fact 3) above that weak aggregate demand and low expected future growth must explain the low Q in the euro area, which in turn explains most of the aggregate euro area investment slump (notably in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands, but not in Italy or Spain). In contrast, the general economic environment as reflected in a high Q does not explain weak US investment, which must be due to other, more structural factors. Building on previous work (Gutiérrez and Philippon 2016), the authors observe that the opening of the aggregate investment gap in the US around 2000 coincides with the start of a trend in corporate concentration and a reduction in antitrust enforcement in the country. (Regulatory reforms in many euro area countries, however, made their product markets more competitive during the 2000s.) Moreover, given high corporate savings (see fact 2) above; see also Eberly 2017, Chart 2), it is not plausible that financial constraints played a large role in the US (except perhaps at the height of the financial crisis). Finally, the share of intangibles in investment is unlikely to explain the difference between the US and the euro area, because its growth was slowing in the early 2000s (see e.g. Eberly 2017, Chart 1, or Jones 2017, Chart 3) and Europe’s share catching up since the late 1990s (Döttling et al, 2017b, Chart 15). In sum, Philippon et al. conclude that deteriorating product market competition is likely to be a major factor in explaining the aggregate US investment gap. But structural features, probably other than corporate concentration, also seem to be of relevance in explaining the investment gaps in Italy and Spain. There is no comparable corporate concentration trend in Europe, but Reinhilde Veugelers (2017) observed that research and development (R&D) expenditures become more concentrated in fewer firms. It needs to be determined whether this R&D concentration is simply a sign of the advantages that leading technological firms may have in terms of efficiency; or whether it may in fact become an obstacle not only to the diffusion of ideas but also to new entrants in the future. As several Sintra authors elaborated, intangibles generally play an increasing role in investment. This is particularly a consequence of the prominent role that digitisation, information and communication technology play in what is often called the third industrial revolution. But in the US a pronounced trend started as early as in the 1950s (see Eberly 2017, Chart 1, and Jones 2017, Chart 3). Once the fixed costs of IT hardware have been paid, human capital and intellectual property gain importance relative to physical capital. This can affect investment and its determinants in various ways. First, as Philippon et al. suggest, intangible assets are more difficult to accumulate quickly, which is tantamount to higher adjustment costs. So, in equilibrium, rising intangible investment should lead to rising Q. Second, Enrico Perotti pointed out that high-intangibles firms pay highly skilled employees to invest their human capital (e.g. to develop software) and therefore do not need to undertake as much traditional investment spending as low-intangibles firms (see Döttling et al. 2017a). In fact, the investment share of some of the most innovative and rapidly growing sectors in the US, namely the high-tech industries, is rather stagnant (Eberly 2017, Chart 3). Third, intangible investments are beset with measurement problems, so that they could be underestimated in available data. All in all, the negative relationship between the share of intangibles and total investment that emerges from this list is consistently confirmed in empirical estimations (Eberly 2017), including (for cross-sectional industry data) in Europe (Döttling et al. 2017b). So, part of the low investment observed in countries with rapidly growing intangible shares, such as the euro area countries covered in Döttling et al., may not be a sign of economic weakness but a sign of structural change and difficulties in capturing intangible investment in available data. But growing intangibles could still be a contributing factor to labour market polarisation, because the employees producing them tend to be highly skilled and paid (see Section 2 above). Relationships between demand and supply policies The Sintra discussions about the slow post-crisis recovery and the role that investment played in it suggest that both supply and demand policies have a role to play, depending on the country and time considered. But demand and supply policies do not need to be substitutes: they can be complements. Philippe Aghion, in a joint paper with Emmanuel Farhi and Enisse Kharroubi (2017a), crystallised this with the example of monetary policy and product market reforms, bolstering President of the ECB Mario Draghi’s (2014) view that “aggregate demand policies will ultimately not be effective without action in parallel on the supply side”. With two different empirical approaches they find that countercyclical interest rate movements become more effective in stimulating output when product markets are more competitive. The first approach starts by estimating the countercyclicality of real short-term interest rates (for the euro area, the area-wide nominal rate divided by national inflation rates) in response to output gaps at the level of 14 advanced economies (9 euro area countries, 3 other EU countries, and Australia and Canada). The second step of this approach is to interact the estimated countercyclicality parameters with measures of firm financial constraints and product market regulation. As long as the 1998 level of the OECD indicator for barriers to trade and investment is low, it turns out in a country-industry panel regression of quarterly data between 1999 and 2005 that a sector with high labour costs to sales (as a measure of firms’ financial constraints) located in a country with high interest rate countercyclicality exhibits a 1.6 percentage points higher real value-added per worker growth than a sector with low labour costs to sales in a country with low interest rate countercyclicality (see the left blue pillar in Figure 5). In contrast, when product market regulation is heavy, then this growth difference evaporates (right pillar in the figure).  Figure 5. Joint effects of the countercyclicality of interest rates and corporate financial constraints on labour productivity for different degrees of product market competition     Notes: The blue bars show the estimated effects of the responsiveness of real short-term interest rates to output gaps (“countercyclicality of interest rates”) and financial constraints in corporate sectors on labour productivity in 14 advanced economies (excluding the US benchmark, they are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden) between 1999 and 2005. The countercyclicalities of interest rates are estimated for each country in separate regressions (and reported in Figure 1 of Aghion et al. (2017)). These country elasticities are then inserted in a cross-country cross-industry panel estimation of productivity in which they are interacted with the ratio of labour costs to sales in the corresponding US industry (as a measure of financial constraints) and a dummy variable for the OECD indicator of barriers to trade and investment (in 1998 as an inverse measure of product market competition; see Aghion et al. (2017), Table 1). Labour productivity is real value-added per worker growth. The two bars show the change in labour productivity in response to a joint change from the first quartile to the third quartile in the industry distribution of financial constraints and from the first to the third quartile in the country distribution of the estimated countercyclicalities of interest rates, once for high (low barriers) and once for low product market competition (high barriers). The vertical axis is in percentage points.   Source: Reproduced from Aghion, Farhi and Kharroubi (2017a), Figure 2. The second approach takes the ECB’s announcement of its Outright Monetary Transactions programme (OMT) in September 2012 as a laboratory. It first estimates forecast errors for 10-year government bond yields of 7 euro area countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain) for the periods 2011-12 and 2013-14, i.e. before and after the OMT announcement. The difference between the two is taken as surprise changes in firms’ funding costs. Stressed countries, such as Italy and Spain, experienced sharp unexpected interest rate drops but the same did not apply to other countries, such as France or Germany. Then a difference-in-difference estimation of industry growth rates for 2013-14 for the 7 countries on industry growth rates for 2011-12, corporate indebtedness (measured in 2010 and 2012, respectively) and interactions between corporate indebtedness, product market regulation (same OECD indicator as in the first approach but for 2013) and the estimated OMT interest rate surprises is conducted. The results suggest that heavily indebted corporate sectors grew faster as a consequence of the large surprising interest reductions, but only when they were located in countries with relatively less regulated product markets. This effect works primarily via short-term debt, which firms can adjust more quickly than long-term debt. It may, however, be attenuated by an uncompetitive banking sector.  Marco Buti (2017) addressed the relationship between demand and supply policies from a fiscal policy angle. He juxtaposed two views on the relationship between fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, one where they are substitutes (e.g. because the temporarily unemployed from labour market reforms would have to be supported) and another where they are complements (e.g. because expansionary demand policies diminish governments’ incentives for introducing politically costly structural reforms). Buti showed recent European evidence supporting the latter view. Before the crisis there was no clear relationship between primary cyclically adjusted budget balances and reductions in employment protection. But with the sovereign debt crisis a positive relationship emerged (see his Chart 2). He argued, however, that the complementary approach may not be the right model for the future, because of rising inequality and fiscal consolidation leading to reduced public education spending and the reforms that are most needed, i.e. the ones stimulating innovation and productivity, having significant budgetary costs. When growth is not enough: inequality and the greater societal context Introduced by a haunting plea from Ben Bernanke (2017) in his dinner speech “When growth is not enough”, some of the Sintra discussions branched out to distributional issues and the societal context that influences the environment in which central bankers, much like other policymakers, act and economic policies are conducted. Bernanke stressed that the continuing structural change when the unusually prosperous post-WWII period in the US “normalised” as of the 1970s was not accompanied by supportive labour market and social policies. Over time, popular dissatisfaction about the economic situation emerged related to stagnating earnings per worker, declining social and economic mobility, social dysfunctions such as drug abuse and distrust of political institutions. Rectifying the situation requires interventionist policies, such as community re-development, infrastructure spending, job training and addiction programmes. For Europe, Bernanke recommended that the continuing labour market reforms that are necessary should be accompanied by training and other work force development; that structural reforms should be accompanied by demand policies; and that political legitimacy should be ensured through subsidiarity. Whilst against the background of ever faster technical progress and structural change it was relatively uncontroversial that the traditional “once-in-a-lifetime schooling strategy” has to give way to continuous updating of knowledge and skills (“lifelong learning”), Dietmar Harhoff (2017) warned that so far there is little systematic implementation and institutional development.  Sergei Guriev (2017, Chart 1) presented “elephant curves” (à la Milanovic 2016), suggesting that the crisis recession acted in a regressive way in southern European countries (see also Buti 2017, Chart 3), whereas in other euro area countries asset price declines implied that the recession’s cost were mostly borne by the better-off. But in terms of popular support for economic policies, Guriev (2017, Table 1) provided evidence that it is not inequality per se but perceived “unfair” inequality (defined as uneven opportunities, such as parental background, gender, ethnicity or place of birth) that leads to the rejection of a market economy (and also corruption). Other factors captured in the residuals of the estimation, such as lack of effort or bad luck, do not have this effect. Agnès Bénassy-Quére (2017) perceived an imbalance in Europe between trade and competition policies being centralised at the area-wide level but social and tax policies being left at the national level. When the federal level promotes free trade and competitive markets, then Member States are left to bear the social consequences. In her view Member States could be better empowered by coordination in tax and social policies. One idea is to make the EU’s Globalisation Adjustment Fund more effective; another is to introduce US-style TTTTs (timely, temporary, and targeted transfers).

2017-07-29,Sabine Lautenschläger,Interview with Mannheimer Morgen,"Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Rolf Obertreis on 25 July and published on 29 July 2017","  Interview with Mannheimer Morgen    Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Rolf Obertreis on 25 July and published on 29 July 2017  IKB, a German Mittelstandsbank*, was facing a serious crisis at the end of July ten years ago. Do you remember that?  The problems with subprime securities, i.e. risky home loans packaged together in bonds, started to appear in April 2007 in a US company. We already had an uneasy feeling in the spring, but we didn’t think that it would send the banking systems into a tailspin.  Many people thought that it was a one-off event. Did you have a premonition of what September 2008 might bring and of what might follow?  Nobody foresaw the extent of what would happen between summer 2007 and summer 2009, even though in late summer 2007 it was becoming clearer that the turbulence could intensify.   Could such a financial and banking crisis happen again?  I would never say that there could be no recurrence of a financial and banking crisis. 100% protection does not exist. However, supervision is today in a much better position. We can intervene much more decisively and also in a more preventive way. Before 2009 supervisors in Germany could only take action if they could clearly demonstrate that banks were at risk and that damage would soon be inflicted. Supervisors can now demand much higher capital requirements for risks at a much earlier stage. A comprehensive new regulatory framework has greatly strengthened supervision.  So, banks and savings banks are now safer than ten years ago.  All credit institutions have significantly more capital and significantly higher liquidity today. The requirements have been increased, including in respect of a bank’s risk management. The management board of a large bank must, for example, include a chief risk officer with wide-ranging powers who has equal status with the other board members.  Banks only need to hold 3% of their balance sheet total as capital. In Germany, measured against the risks on the balance sheets, the figure is now on average around 12%. That seems small when you look at the capital ratios of small and medium-sized enterprises, for instance.  The 3% relates to each and every bank transaction, whether it is risky or not. It is a sort of basic provision. Besides, the quality of capital is very carefully monitored. Is it immediately available to cover risks? Or is there only a commitment that the capital would be available in the event of a crisis? Supervisors closely scrutinise the risks posed by assets, loans and trading activities. The greater the risks of such deals, the more capital the bank must hold. A German government bond, for example, does not represent a risk when calculating the capital ratio, unlike securitised loans. So the average figure of 12% is only indicative.  So you take a close look at banks’ books?  Yes. And in the end the capital ratio for one business segment may be much higher than the average. On average three times as much capital has been put aside for the trading activities of banks as in 2008. But we also need to strike the right balance between capital requirements and risk. After all, banks should always be able to issue loans to businesses and consumers and to support the real economy, to assist with mergers and acquisitions, and to organise initial public offerings on the stock market.   Savings banks and credit unions are complaining about the costs of regulation and about supervisors going too far.  Generally speaking, the same risks must be subject to the same rules. Nevertheless, a systemically important bank must today meet considerably more stringent requirements and is monitored much more closely than a savings bank or a credit union. The key point is that a major bank in difficulty is more likely to pose a threat to financial stability than a small bank, and if that is the case, distinctions are called for in some, but not all, rules. And after ten years, we should check whether the new rules are also having the intended effect.  In the United States there are plans to relax the rules for banks.  I don’t believe in returning now to deregulation or to purely national rules. That would be a big mistake. We need globally consistent rules for the activities of large banks, of banks which are important for the financial system. The crisis should have taught us that. Banks are not only highly interconnected with each other but also with financial markets, and only global rules can protect us from chain reactions and regulatory arbitrage, i.e. exploiting differences in regulatory standards.  There is now a European resolution authority for ailing banks, but recently it didn’t intervene in several credit institutions in Italy. Again, the taxpayer is being asked to cough up. You can’t have liked that.  We have taken some enormous steps forward with the European resolution authority and our banking supervision. But we haven’t yet reached our goal. For instance, European banking supervision is still lacking some tried and tested tools to be able to act more quickly and effectively. Take the moratorium tool, for example: if a bank gets into trouble, all cash outflows can initially be stopped. That tool exists in Germany but not in Spain.  But banking supervision is in any case in a state of flux because there are constant innovations. Just think of the fintechs.  Yes, there are always new developments in the banking business – but there’s no need to react to every innovation with a new tool. After all, you don’t buy a new screwdriver every time you buy a new shelf, regardless of whether you bought it from a Swedish furniture store or from an exclusive manufacturer.  Are credit institutions earning enough money? Banks are complaining about low interest rates and the resulting lower interest margin.  The low interest rate environment is certainly a challenge in the long run. But the earnings performance of quite a few banks was already critical when interest rates were high. That’s because, among other things, we have a very large number of banks in Germany, around 1,600. There are, in fact, too many of them. They maintain a large and very costly network of branches. And because competition is fierce, the banks’ margins are low. Loans are cheap, some of them too cheap, and some banking services are being provided free of charge. That eats away at earnings.   So we need more mergers.  Consolidation is necessary. Some banks have already been moving in that direction, such as in the cooperative sector. There are now fewer than 1,000 cooperative banks; 15 years ago there were several hundred more. But banks must continue to squeeze costs and open up new sources of revenue.  So prices are set to rise for customers?  Not all banking services can remain as favourable as they are now. We see aggressive rates in some areas. While the supervisor doesn’t determine prices, generally speaking good services should command fair prices. Such services can’t be free forever.   Do you understand why German savers are complaining about low interest rates?  Yes, I understand why, but every saver is an employee or a business person, and sometimes also a borrower. There are, for instance, many young families who can build their own home because interest rates are very low. An expansionary monetary policy helps in the medium and long term, also because, as a result of growth, jobs are created, which in turn generate income. Only that makes it possible for people to buy property or to save or invest.  You approach monetary policy as a member of the ECB’s Executive Board and Governing Council. When will the ECB start to unwind its monetary policy?  The expansionary monetary policy has both advantages and side effects. As time passes, the positive effects get weaker and the risks increase. So it’s important to prepare for the exit in good time. What’s crucial in that context is a stable trend in the rate of inflation towards our objective of just under 2%. It’s not quite there yet. Still, we need to address the issue: how should the return to normal monetary policy be arranged? What will be the time frame, what will be the tools and what will be the sequence? What steps are to be taken and when should we start to wind down the bond purchases?  That’s likely to be a long process.  That’s why we on the ECB’s Governing Council should now answer the questions I just asked. ___ * A Mittelstandsbank serves small and medium-sized enterprises.  "
2017-07-08,Peter Praet,Interview with De Standaard,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Pascal Dendooven and Goele De Cort on 3 July 2017, published on 8 July 2017","  Interview with De Standaard   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Pascal Dendooven and Goele De Cort on 3 July 2017, published on 8 July 2017  It looked like a reversal last week. ECB President Mario Draghi's speech in Sintra had an impact on the markets, interest rates increased and the euro strengthened, the markets took it as a signal that an end to the ECB's stimulus is in sight.  I see it more as an evolution in our communications. In essence, we said that the economy is doing better and that growth is looking good. And since the last meeting of the Governing Council the positive news has continued. The tone was rather optimistic regarding growth, and rightly so. But, and this has to do with our mandate, the underlying inflationary pressure remains subdued. This is why we also stress that we should be patient and persistent regarding our monetary policy.   Proof that your policy of quantitative easing has worked?  Some people said that this policy would create hyperinflation whereas others thought that, at best, it would have no effect. Low interest rates would supposedly not lead to more investment and growth, but they have in fact had a very favourable impact. Not only in the real estate market but also elsewhere. It was also said that people would start to save more and spend less in order to compensate for the loss of interest income and to secure their retirement. But the saving rate has remained stable. Only investment was more sluggish than we had hoped, but that is picking up now. Surveys among SMEs show that they no longer find it so difficult to obtain loans.   Nothing new, in your view, but a sharp market reaction nonetheless. Have markets not become overly focused on messages from the ECB? Is that still a healthy situation?  It's true that in the short term there was a clear reaction. People also had the impression that it was a sort of “coordinated” action by different central bankers but that wasn't the case.  Our message was very nuanced. The thing is, deflationary pressures were considerable in 2015. At that time, we faced negative shocks to the economy. There was a sense of urgency. That no longer applies.  Now indeed inflation is picking up, but that is a process that is a long way from completion. From an inflation perspective, we cannot be satisfied yet.  We need patience and persistence. We need to be patient because inflation convergence needs more time to show through convincingly in the data. And we need to be persistent, because our baseline for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) says that we should increase interest rates so as to keep some ammunition in reserve in case we encounter difficult times again. But if we increase interest rates and tighten policy too quickly, we could jeopardise the recovery and end up further away than ever from our (inflation) target.   The ECB has pumped more than €2 trillion into the market. How confident are you that all those funds can be absorbed in an orderly manner?  The ECB Governing Council will discuss the conclusions for monetary policy and what this means for quantitative easing. I can't say anything about that yet. We do say that we still need a long period of accommodative policy before we are ready.  As the economic prospects brighten, higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions increasingly attractive. This will reinforce accommodation and make sure that inflation sustainably converges towards our objective of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  Growth is picking up and unemployment is going down, but wages are not really increasing. Doesn't that totally contradict traditional economic theory?  Wages are also a reflection of the past. Wage increases are partly based on current inflation rates and they are relatively low at the moment. Let us also not forget that the level of unemployment is still high. That merely underlines that the process of reflation is a long one that remains highly dependent on accommodative monetary policy.  But will the wages still evolve in the same way as before, now that all kinds of new factors are emerging such as computerisation, flexible jobs, etc? Are the ECB's instruments still reliable?  Well, how do you measure the impact of China on international competition, of e-commerce, of automation? We have many internal discussions about that, about whether something in the inflation process has broken down. The Phillips curve (which shows that wages rise when unemployment falls) is not broken, but it is flatter and the process is slower. Wage inflation is on the way, but we need to be patient about these things.  Wages are not increasing very much and most of the newly created jobs offer less attractive terms of employment.   Some labour market developments are positive but others negative. People aged over 50 are returning to the labour market; that came as a surprise to us. And we also see an increase in labour market potential owing to migration, especially from central and eastern European countries. Because of migration from those countries, Germany still has a significant labour supply despite having a high level of employment.  Some of those central and eastern European countries, such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, are now experiencing stronger wage inflation. That will spread. The more people who are employed, the bigger the increase in disposable income, the more that is spent.  On the other hand, we see that youth unemployment is particularly high in a number of countries and that getting young people into jobs is not easy. Another factor influencing wage inflation is that more people are working as self-employed. We are increasingly seeing a dual labour market. Even in the civil service. On the one hand, you have insiders with an attractive job and a high degree of protection and on the other, the new employees who do not have the same terms, work under more flexible contracts and can be let go more easily. Of course you might say: so what's the problem? That is part of market reform, it's good for the economy. Don’t forget that, in this way, quite a few people can avoid long periods of unemployment. Those new jobs create earnings and stop people from losing their skills. On the other hand, there are also risks if the labour market reforms lead to a dual labour market, not only from an ethical standpoint but also because economic growth is not “inclusive”. For that reason, I see a role for the government in correcting the negative redistribution effects of reforms.   It's a fixed component in President Mario Draghi's speeches: governments also need to introduce structural reforms, monetary policy cannot do everything. Has Belgium made sufficient use of the low interest rates to introduce the necessary reforms?  I don't like commenting on government policy, and certainly not on that of my own country. But speaking in general terms, I can say that the pension reforms were good decisions in countries such as Italy and Belgium. Belgium has also undertaken a small measure of labour market reform.  The point is that it should also be possible to do so. In Belgium the debate on the reform of corporate tax, for example, has been going on for quite some time. There is still a heavy reform agenda. Much still needs to be done and not everyone agrees on how to go about it.  The risk is that the appetite for reform will wane as the economy improves. People have a tendency to lean back and take a break.   Is that what's happening in Belgium now?  Not only in Belgium. There is a sort of honeymoon atmosphere. Times have been hard and people would like to take a break from reforming and enjoy the improvements for a while. There's a kind of reform fatigue. But not everyone is enjoying the recovery because unemployment is still too high and there are differences in contracts between insiders and outsiders, etc.  But it has to happen, because monetary policy can't fix everything. France is a good example. The financial situation there was not much different to that in Germany. There was no banking crisis in France. But growth has been weaker in France than in Germany, because German industry was able to adapt, to focus on new markets – first China, then the United States. They have more SMEs that are export oriented, whereas French industry is much more dependent on a number of national champions. This shows that there are limits to what monetary policy can do.  Critics are saying that the ECB's low interest rate policy is reducing the incentive to reform.  Governments should have made more use of the low interest rates. But the fact that there has been too little reform isn't because low interest rates are making it easier for them to muddle through. Rather, it's because they aren't managing to sell the reforms. I talk to politicians regularly and they all know what needs to be done. But they are also afraid that they won't get elected again afterwards.  I hope that the general public, through seeing better and better results, will start to grasp the importance of reforms.   Will the [rise of the far left] PTB party in Wallonia have a major impact?  Yes, I’ve seen it. But take Macron: he's been able to build a movement because there was a window of opportunity to go for reforms. But that has nothing to do with the interest rate. In France the public voted for Macron because they want changes, but we have yet to see which ones will actually get through.  In Belgium the Government also started out with reform ambitions.  Yes, indeed. Lots of governments have good intentions. The OECD has commented positively on that recently. Above all, reform means getting people on board. I sometimes take a taxi and I often talk to the taxi driver. Many of them have paid huge sums for a licence, which they intend to sell later to guarantee themselves a pension. It's only logical that the taxi drivers will fight for their jobs. If you suddenly changed the rules to try to break the taxi market open, it would really cost a lot of money. Let’s assume that in the Paris region alone there are more than 30,000 taxis. The costs for a licence can be as high as €200,000. If you want to buy out those rights, you’re already talking about billions. Those are amounts that are suddenly macroeconomically relevant. This is what you also see with labour market reforms. The incumbents, the insiders, are protected when there are reforms, while the newcomers who want a job have to be more flexible.   Belgium has been held up as a champion of reform. Were you surprised?  A bit. At the same time it is good to acknowledge that there have been reforms. Nevertheless we know that there are still huge challenges. Belgium is still some way behind Germany, where there's money left over and they don’t know what to do with it.   Which reforms are needed most urgently now?  There are several. Reforms to pensions, the labour market and justice for example are recognised as being crucial in Italy. Education and training are also crucial in my view. Flanders has a good education system, but training for jobs on the shop floor could be better.   Should we be worried about automation and robotisation?  Productivity growth has been the source of wealth since time immemorial. But there are other ways of countering negative redistribution effects than blocking progress. That’s what we have the government’s redistribution policies for. There are also things that robots can't do. Human interaction will remain important in many service jobs. These are currently often quite badly paid jobs, such as waiting tables or caring for the elderly in retirement homes. There is a reason why these professions are known as “bottleneck jobs”. Whether their wages will rise if demand increases further? I don't know. In any case in the future it will be not just about having the right skills on the labour market, but also about the necessary EQ and empathy, the soft skills. A robot can’t offer that.   In the recent bank rescue in Italy, Italian taxpayers have been left to pick up the bill, despite all the bail-in principles. Was Europe looking the other way?  It's not a case of good or bad, we are still in a transition phase. The most important thing is for the banking sector to adapt. I can understand the decision to use tax money to solve problems from the past. But the sector has to adapt and restructure.  There are still a lot of bad loans in the sector, we have yet to see whether the adjustments will have been sufficient. Banking union is essential. The resolution component is too slow. There can be flexibility for solving historical problems, but the sector needs to adapt.  Do you agree with the late Luc Coene that there's one big bank too many in Belgium, without mentioning Belfius specifically?  I don't know. Luc was a very good friend of mine. He had a very clear solution to any problem. I think there's also room for diversity in the banking market. In Belgium what you see is that many of those in the market are targeting home loans, resulting in intense competition there. Diversity means that big banks have to look abroad more for profit. You don't necessarily need fewer banks, it's just that they shouldn't all target the same thing.  Something else: fifty years ago you were the tender age of eighteen, during the Summer of Love. It's said that you were a real hippie in those days. How much is left of the ideals from back then?  (Laughs) That is so long ago. 1967! Actually I was in Woodstock again recently, as I had a conference not far away. So I gave my wife a call: ""Guess where I am now?"" What can I say? Belgium was also new to me at the time, when I went to Brussels to study at the age of seventeen. That was difficult, because I didn't know anyone at all. The second year was a relief. It was mostly fun. A time of liberal thought, of freedom and tolerance for different ideas. Before that it was very different.  It was a time when the consumer society was making headway, nobody was very worried that they wouldn't be able to find a job. People were interested in each other and took time to greet each other, like bikers still do now. You see that a lot less these days.   "
2017-07-07,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Le Monde and La Stampa,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel (Le Monde) and Alessandro Barbera (La Stampa), on 3 July, published on 7 July 2017","  Interview with Le Monde and La Stampa    Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marie Charrel (Le Monde) and Alessandro Barbera (La Stampa), on 3 July, published on 7 July 2017   Optimism is back in the euro area. Are we at the beginning of a “golden decade”?  It’s true that in the space of one year the situation has improved considerably. The euro area can be said to have entered a phase of economic expansion. The recovery has finally arrived. It has spread to virtually all sectors and countries. This is excellent news. But it would be unwise to let our guard down, because this recovery is of a cyclical nature and builds on significant support from monetary policy. There is still much to do to make it long-lasting. Structural growth needs to be strengthened in each country and the euro area must be made more resilient to shocks.  Emmanuel Macron’s election in France has rightly relaunched the discussions on strengthening the euro area. Which area of work must be prioritised?  The priority is reform in each country. That goes for France and Italy, among others, but also for Germany. For example, the rates of economic growth have now largely converged in the various euro area countries, but their per capita income levels still differ widely. This is a problem for the euro area. Once each of the Member States has done its share of the work, they will then be able to strengthen their joint structures. In the end, I think that this calls for stronger institutions, such as a finance ministry that is allocated a common budget, but let’s be careful not to put the cart before the horse.   How can the Germans be convinced to move towards this common budget?  There will be no single budget policy, as the Member States do not want one. Pooling the budget is simply a tool that allows joint projects to be financed. To make progress in this area, it is necessary to sweep away the preconceptions that paralyse the discussions between the Member States. In Germany, for example, people think that Berlin alone paid for the other countries during the crisis, which is not true. In France, the thinking is that Europe is dominated by Germany, which is also not the case. And in Italy, the euro is held responsible for the country’s problems, when the Italian economy’s weaknesses, such as lacklustre productivity growth, pre-date the single currency. Such biases will not go away until the economies have converged sufficiently.  Why does making the labour market more flexible appear to be the keystone of reforms to be carried out in France?  Reforming the French labour market has become extremely symbolic in Europe: it is considered everywhere as proof of France’s willingness to reform. That’s what makes it essential. The new French Government fully understands this. However, this can only be a first step. The notorious “flexicurity” includes the word “security”. Making the labour market more flexible can unleash potential, but doing so also requires safeguarding workers’ careers and reforming their training. There is also the problem of the mismatch between France’s output and foreign demand, as shown by its external deficit, which is one of the highest in the euro area. This deficit is not the result of an overly rigid labour market, but rather of a skills mismatch. Education and training must therefore be at the heart of the reforms of the French economy.   Should inspiration be taken from the Italian “Jobs Act” reform, which introduced a single labour contract?   Each country has its own unique features, but it’s true that, with the “Jobs Act”, Italy went further than France. What is more, this reform is starting to bear fruit.  Several plans are also on the table for eurobonds, these European bonds whereby the risks are more or less shared among the member countries. What is the current thinking on these?   Discussions are under way, in particular within the European Systemic Risk Board. But it is unrealistic to imagine, as is too often the case in France, that technical fixes can solve political problems. Prior to any reform of the euro area, discussions need to take place on the joint projects and their democratic basis. Public debt, whether French or European, constitutes the taxes of tomorrow and beyond. Who will vote for these taxes? The national parliaments or the European Parliament? And what will they finance? These are very political choices. With the economic upswing and the return of confidence in Europe, the time has come to embark on this joint reflection.  Doesn’t the coming increase in interest rates pose a threat to the countries with weak public finances?   The increase in long-term interest rates is the result of consolidating growth. Governments and financial players must prepare themselves for it. They are aware of that.  Do the divisions within the European Central Bank (ECB) over the withdrawal of exceptional monetary policy measures weaken its credibility?  The European treaties chose for monetary policy to be steered by a governing council precisely to allow for the expression of different viewpoints. This range of opinions is an antidote to groupthink. What’s essential is to come to a consensus at the end of the discussion, which is nearly always what happens. There is no disagreement over the current monetary policy stance.  How can one avoid the reduction of monetary support causing panic on the markets?   The choices available to the ECB are too often caricatured by its observers. Some fear that we might traumatise the financial markets if we turn the dial of monetary policy by a millimetre, while others prescribe a forced march towards normalisation. The reality is quite different. As early as last December, we scaled back our asset purchases without undermining the support given to the economy. So, I would argue that we have already adjusted our monetary policy, and this was made possible by the continued improvement in the economic situation. This adjustment has been done in a very careful way, as a number of factors continue to weigh on inflation. If needed, the Governing Council will continue to adjust its instruments both qualitatively and quantitatively. But when this is needed, it should do so carefully and flexibly, and based on what matters for us within the framework of our mandate: the inflation outlook. We must be transparent in our communications on these developments. Otherwise we run the risk of a more abrupt adjustment for the markets when the decisions are actually taken.  But inflation today is very close to the objective of 2%...  We base our decisions on facts, but make no mistake – without monetary support, inflation today would not be approaching 2%. That gives us reason to be careful. The underlying inflationary pressures are still weak. Another issue that we are monitoring closely is the impact of the ECB’s negative deposit rates on the banking sector and its capacity to support the economy. Banks’ profitability and the growth in credit show that fears over negative side-effects are not justified at present. In the light of these observations, there is no reason to change our strategy.  Some economists argue that low rates are contributing to speculative bubbles forming, in particular in the housing market. Are they wrong?  We monitor financial stability very closely. Our assessment is that there are currently no bubbles at euro area level. There’s a simple reason for this – financial asset bubbles have historically been associated with an increase in bank credit and the size of banks. Today, the flow of credit to the economy is picking up but remains moderate. What is more, the size of the banking sector is limited by regulation.  What about bubbles in unregulated financial institutions in the “shadow banking” sector?  The increase in credit in this sector is happening quickly, and we have a limited number of tools with which to constrain it. It’s an area of concern for the future.  By being so cautious, isn’t the ECB at risk of finding itself out of ammunition when the next crisis hits?  The main danger for the euro area is having to tackle the next slowdown without the necessary tools. Today, the euro area economy is exceeding its cruising speed, mainly due to the support of monetary policy. Without reforms, however, growth will peter out sooner or later. So it’s critical that the euro area prepares for future shocks by recovering fiscal room for manoeuvre. The most indebted countries, which include France and Italy, should take advantage of the current upturn to consolidate their public finances. The French Government’s commitment to bring the public deficit below the 3% threshold this year is a positive step. It prepares the country for the future and enables it to regain credibility in Europe.  Is the lure of protectionism a threat to the global economy?   At the global level, this temptation is very strong. And that’s a serious problem. The global economy needs cooperation. We were only able to overcome the 2007 crisis through a collective commitment, in particular from the G20 and the Financial Stability Board, to resist protectionism and respect common financial standards. Going back on that commitment would hurt growth and employment. In this context, Europe has a responsibility to defend the values of openness and free movement that it embodies, without being naive. For example, the free trade deals agreed with Canada, and soon to be agreed with Japan, contain guarantees that uphold the European values of respect for social standards, public services and the environment. Protectionism should not be confused with protection.  Is that enough to protect those who lose out as a result of globalisation?  The tools to deal with this issue are mainly available at national level. But Europe is probably the best-equipped region. Some years ago, Chancellor Angela Merkel highlighted that Europe accounts for 7% of the world’s population and 25% of its GDP, but 50% of its social expenditure. European countries’ responsibility, first and foremost, is to ensure that their social systems are sustainable and work well by securing their funding. And this doesn’t exclude European-level mechanisms.  Is common unemployment insurance an example of this?   Personally, I‘m not sure. Harmonising workers’ rights seems to me to be a difficult goal to achieve. But tools available at European level, such as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, could be better used. Currently, too few workers have access to it. In addition, the best way to protect workers is to provide them with training. This priority is not visible enough in European budgets.  Is Italy the sick man of the euro area?   I wouldn’t say that. I’m optimistic for the Italian economy over the short term. It is benefiting from accelerating economic growth in the euro area. Reforms such as the “Jobs Act” are bearing fruit and the banks’ non-performing loan problem is now being dealt with proactively. On the other hand, the country’s long-term growth prospects remain lower than those of the euro area as a whole, and that’s a problem. But I must highlight that it’s a problem that already existed before the euro was introduced. Today, this is making it harder to reduce the public debt, but doing so is vital for Italy’s future.  Does the Italian economy really benefit from the euro?  Yes, of course! The single currency, like banking union, is very beneficial for Italy. Today in Italy there’s a kind of mistrust of Europe, which is particularly worrying given that it is one of the EU’s founding Member States, where the Community values have always been strong. One of the major challenges in the months to come will be for Italy to reclaim the European project. It’s vital that it does so. Europe needs Italy to stand up for it. A well-functioning Franco-German alliance is also necessary, but it isn’t enough on its own. Italy is a key component of the European project. Today, we need it to act as a positive force and be supportive of the euro.  The Italian banks Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza were wound up using public funds. Is this a failure for banking union?  No. Quite the contrary, in fact. The ECB, in its role as banking supervisor, identified the problems ahead of time and put pressure on the banks to strengthen their capital, which they did on several occasions, and to find a buyer. Once these options were exhausted, the ECB declared that these two banks were failing or likely to fail, in order to trigger the mechanism for winding them down. The decisions regarding their liquidation and the use of public funds do not fall under our remit, but everything was done in accordance with European rules. Of course, there are lessons to be learnt, but let‘s not lose sight of the bigger picture. From now on, it will be possible to close down banks when they are no longer viable. This is a massive cultural shift in Europe – for a long time the assumption had been that all banks had to be kept afloat, including those that were no longer viable. This mindset contributed to the weakness of the European banking sector, which currently has too many institutions. It will have to consolidate.  Will the Brexit negotiations harm investment in the euro area?  Brexit is bad news for everyone, but it was the British people’s choice, and its economic impact is far less significant for us than it is for them. Political uncertainty is diminishing on the Continent, which helps boost investment, but in the United Kingdom the opposite seems to be the case. It is for the British people to choose their destiny outside of the European Union, but one thing must be clear: this cannot call into question the coherence of the European project and the integrity of its single market – a legal space in which the common rules are respected and consumers and investors are protected. The purpose of the European institutions is to protect that integrity. And that holds true if the negotiations fail, which is sadly a possibility.  With its economy battered by year after year of crisis, what could be the future drivers of growth in Greece?  That is the issue the Greek Government can now tackle. The agreement reached by the Eurogroup in June isn’t perfect, because it doesn’t provide a clear answer to the issue of Greek debt sustainability, but it will enable the economy to stabilise and investment to return. If political uncertainty and uncertainties around the implementation of the aid package disappear, I am sure that Greece will be able to benefit from a strong cyclical recovery that will ultimately enable it to consider its model for future growth. The time has finally come to ask these long-term questions.  "
2017-07-05,Vítor Constâncio,We need a coordinated European NPL strategy - How to deal with Europe’s market for lemons?,"Opinion piece by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, 5 July 2017","  We need a coordinated European NPL strategyHow to deal with Europe’s market for lemons?   Opinion piece by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, 5 July 2017 One of the most pressing issues for euro area banks is the nearly €1 trillion of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets. While the average euro area NPL ratio has declined gradually from a peak of 8% in 2013, it still remains at 6% and differences across countries are marked: six countries still have NPL ratios of more than 10%, significantly more in some cases. This is not just a problem for banks. The flip side of NPLs is over-indebtedness among households and firms, and this poses a macroeconomic challenge – banks restrict credit supply and distressed firms curtail investment, which in turn hampers economic growth. Asset quality issues were exacerbated by the global financial crisis. When the crisis hit, the surge in NPLs blocked the ability of many banks to deal with distressed debt. NPL resolution, though not a panacea for all banking problems, could bring significant benefits. It is not easy to estimate the effects of resolving NPLs. However, scenario-based analysis indicates that replacing NPLs with performing assets could increase the aggregate return on equity of euro area banks by more than 1 percentage point, with some countries’ banking sectors gaining up to 5 percentage points.  It is therefore essential to find a solution to the NPL problem, but we must recognise that it will take time and no single instrument is likely to be a “magic bullet”. Rather, it will require a comprehensive strategy involving a panoply of instruments. The ECB is already working on this and has issued clear guidance to the banks it directly supervises. But supervisory action is not enough on its own. The private sector and national and European authorities also have roles to play. Several significant impediments affect the prices of NPLs, to varying degrees across euro area countries. The market for distressed debt can be characterised as a “market for lemons”. This is a situation where investors demand a premium to protect themselves from the uncertainty that better-informed banks will try to sell them assets whose credit quality is worse than it may seem on the surface. This results in limited market activity, as the prices that investors are prepared to pay for NPLs are much lower than the prices banks would be prepared to sell them for. Structural inefficiencies in debt and collateral enforcement also contribute to the lack of market turnover. The legal procedures for collecting a simple claim take too long and cost too much in many euro area countries. On the demand side, investors are also deterred by high uncertainty around recoveries and their timing, and by barriers to entry such as licensing requirements. These symptoms of market failure, aggravated by legal constraints, call for a public policy response. European and national authorities should launch a comprehensive strategy that combines a range of suitable tools to deal effectively with Europe’s NPL problems. A key aspect of that strategy will be aligning incentives between the parties involved: banks, investors and the authorities. A number of tools look particularly promising. National asset management companies (AMCs), if designed correctly, have been successful in relieving banks’ NPL burdens and recovering asset value. A blueprint for national AMCs in the euro area – essentially, a manual for setting up an AMC – would save authorities time and money. In addition to clarifying in detail how AMCs can be made compatible with the EU legal framework, such a blueprint should identify international best practices for key aspects of AMCs such as eligible asset classes, participation requirements, asset valuation, capital and funding structures and governance. Apart from AMCs, securitisation schemes also have the potential to kick-start the NPL secondary market, but may require public intervention to signal that governments are determined to follow through with structural reforms that will improve asset valuations. NPL trading platforms or clearing houses should also be fully explored, even at euro area level, to increase NPL transparency and stimulate transaction activity. To be successful, however, all of these options require a considerable push for structural reforms related to debt enforcement and a reduction of information asymmetries. If these measures become credible, investors will recognise the shift in policy and should ultimately be willing to pay higher prices for NPLs. The European Commission has recently announced that it will come forward with a proposal for a comprehensive and coordinated strategy to deal with NPLs, including a blueprint for national AMCs. It will be then imperative that all relevant authorities act rapidly and decisively to implement the necessary measures to overcome the NPL problem thereby strengthening the ongoing European recovery. Much hard work is needed, on many fronts, to deliver these benefits. But neither partial solutions, nor further delays, are viable options if we want to tackle the NPL burden and avoid a renewed build-up of NPLs in future cyclical downturns.

2017-07-04,Sabine Lautenschläger,Interview with the Financial Times,"Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Claire Jones and Caroline Binham and published on 4 July 2017","  Interview with the Financial Times   Interview with Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Claire Jones and Caroline Binham and published on 4 July 2017  If I may, if we just start with the big topic of Brexit, you’ve given a few speeches in the last few months just about what the Single Supervisory Mechanism’s (SSM) expectations would be for UK institutions looking to establish a base in the eurozone, and you said you don’t really want to accept just a brass plate, that you would want something substantial here. Could you elaborate a little bit more about what your expectations are for institutions that are looking to come?  Well, first of all, we do not want to have an empty shell in the euro area where booking is done, but not the risk management; there’s the question of governance, the question of what kind of strategy does the bank have for the euro area entity: is it fully somewhere else where we do not have the contact, where we cannot supervise correctly? So, it is a question of the balance between what kind of risk profile a bank with a licence in the euro area has, what kind of risk exposure, what kind of risk management and what kind of decision-making has to take place in the euro area. Our supervisory expectations are that we do not expect the banks not to do some back-to-back booking; it’s not, from our point of view, forbidden. But the euro entity should not be an empty shell where the credit risk stays in the euro area, and all of the market risks are booked and governed and managed outside of the euro area.  Is the expectation that an institution would actually set up a subsidiary or would some other kind of less onerous requirement, particularly when it comes to capital and liquidity, be okay for you?  Well, that depends on the legal environment we must have, and, as you know, there’s a discussion ongoing at the level of the European Commission concerning intermediate parent undertakings. That does not mean that third-country branches would not be allowed, but it depends a on what kind of business there is, and what kind of structure the banks want to have too. It’s not always the supervisor saying ‘I want you to have a subsidiary’, but sometimes the banks do see an advantage in having a subsidiary in a particular region in order to provide services to their clients there through a subsidiary rather than a branch.  Just on the issue of third-country branches versus subsidiaries, in terms of understanding the difference: is it that the subsidiary is fully capitalised and has liquidity buffers of its own and the third-country branch doesn’t, or is it more nuanced than that?  Well, that depends where you have a third-country branch, and that’s exactly why we point to fragmentation in the euro area in the supervisory and in the regulatory landscape, which needs to be addressed. Depending on where you would establish a third-country branch, how supervision is done can be different; it’s not harmonised. When you establish a subsidiary, you have very clear European rules, the ones which the UK, until now, followed and complied with too. So, you have your capital requirements and you have your liquidity standards. It’s very clear that the supervisory approach in the euro area for subsidiaries is the same. When a subsidiary is a significant one, it is supervised by us according to our standards; when the subsidiary is less significant it is supervised by the national competent authorities (NCAs), but according to our standards. We have a joint supervisory approach. If it is a third-country branch or if it is an investment firm, it’s under national supervision and under a national regime with regard to capital or liquidity, and you might have countries where you have similar or even the same capital or liquidity demands and in other countries, it is quite different from a subsidiary.  Do you have many of those third-country branches currently? Because a lot of the non-European firms use their passport from subsidiaries from the UK and then passport it into Europe.  Yes, there are some from the US, from Switzerland, from the UK, and from Japan. These are the most important, yes.   But you think this loophole regarding branches does need to be addressed in the next couple of years?  I think it should be addressed, especially when we are talking about systemic third-country branches. So, I would make a difference between the smaller ones and the ones which have very relevant banking activities. There are third-country branches under a national regime, which might be very relevant. Then there are subsidiaries of investment firms that can do everything except deposit-taking under a national regime too. And then you have different intragroup exposure rules in the different countries, which are very important too. When you try to book activities in different entities of one structure in the euro area, it might be relevant what kind of intragroup rules and limits you have – these are partly national, partly harmonised. In addition, you shouldn’t forget all the questions of recovery and resolution where the structure of activities of a third country within the euro area play an important role.  So that’s an issue, that these third-country branches aren’t completely covered by the resolution rules for Europe?  That is a very good question. The rules around the third-country branches are different because of these national regimes. The resolution or the recovery, and the resolvability is then a different issue because it’s not according to the harmonised standard.  How about within the SSM itself? Do you feel that you have now enough resources to cope with what might be quite a large influx of new institutions that are going to need some supervising that may be systemic, and, therefore, come under the SSM directly?  Right now, we are in the internal process of resource planning. So, I can’t give you a number, but hopefully we will increase our staff already this year, and for sure next year, in order to cope with the wave of authorisations, licensing, qualified holding procedures and internal model approvals. And then some of these people will move into the joint supervisory teams which we have for each of our significant banks. Our joint supervisory teams are comprised of ECB staff and NCA staff, so you’ll always have to take the NCAs into account too with regard to staffing. We have had many meetings already, so we know that there will be banks coming, not yet perhaps fully their structure and where they will locate, but there will be banks coming. So, from my perspective, it is justified to already ask for staff this year, and then we will adjust according to the applications coming in. I’m pretty positive that we’ll get staff with the right skill set. We are quite experienced with recruiting staff. In 2014, we had 26,000 applications.  Yes, working in banking supervision is very popular.  Well, it’s very nice to work in an environment where we have 28 nationalities. I have been a supervisor, for many years now and I still like our Friday morning meetings where so many different people with different experiences and from different countries come together. We can exchange the expertise we have when making our assessments on individual bank cases. This is an opportunity many people would like to have – to gain such knowledge and to gain experience – so we are positive that we will be able to recruit good people.  Is that something you think about? Maybe recruiting more Brits because they’re going to have experience at some of these banks coming in? Would they be attractive? And what happens then in terms of the rules?  Yes, this might be one of the discussions we will have. We already had a discussion with the British staff here at the ECB.   You mentioned the need to work closely with the NCAs as well. How do you think the relationship is with the NCAs at the moment? Are you happy that there isn’t a race to the bottom to try and attract companies out of London?  Well, for the part I know – and these are the banking supervisors – I do not see a race to the bottom. Everybody knows there will be supervisory standards to be fulfilled and complied with according to the SSM/ECB banking supervision harmonised standards. We do have, for example, one directorate here which works directly together with the different NCAs on the supervision of less significant banks. They issue the standards for the less significant ones. They are in daily contact with the NCAs about, for example, their high-priority less significant institutions (LSIs). So, we have about 100 LSIs, which we consider as high priority in our ordering of banks into relevance clusters, and this directorate works together with the NCAs on the licensing for LSIs. The licensing, whether you are a significant bank or a less significant bank, is done at the ECB, so there is joint work with the NCAs involved here.  Are you confident that the heads of the national central banks will sign off on staff increases at the Governing Council? I was reading that this has been a bit of a problem in the past.  The Governors?  Yes, the Governors.   Well, we apply an agreed methodology for this. We put banks into clusters, depending on their size, interconnectedness, complexity, and depending on the cluster they are in – we have five – then the bank gets a certain amount of staff. So, it is a methodology which is intuitive.  You mentioned recently in a speech that banks need to be contingency-planning for a hard Brexit, even if that is not necessarily the outcome. Prudent planning would mean you plan for the worst. Do you think banks are doing enough of that at the moment, as you’ve seen?  Well, I believe the very big ones are quite well progressed in their planning. Many of them still need to make a clear decision on what kind of structure they want to adopt and what kind of location they want to have for their operations. It’s not yet too late, but I think these kinds of decisions should be made pretty quickly because time is running out.  It takes a couple of years to get your authorisation and set up.  Exactly, especially when you have different entities coming in, and you have a whole new structure. So, I think it is worthwhile to maintain momentum, and I think the one or the other bank really needs to speed up a little bit more – I’m thinking about the middle-sized ones. So, my message would be very clear: ‘Speed up. Make up your mind and contact us early so that we can have a discussion about your plans, about the expectations on both sides.’  And these are mid-sized banks that are already under SSM supervision?  No, I was now talking about the banks looking to relocate to the euro area. For the SSM banks that will want to operate in the UK, we have very clear monitoring. We set up working groups and task forces, and here too I can say that there are some banks which are already well progressed in their preparations. They have a clear understanding about what they want to do. But then things are easier when they already have entities in the UK so it’s not a question of whether they want to relocate or not. Then there are the others that still have to make up their minds, and to them I say very clearly that they should speed up.  And for those who have made licence applications, have you noticed anything about the type of banks that have been doing it? Have you been surprised by the number? Are there more or less than you thought?  Well, there are not many official applications right now because, as I said, banks have to decide about what structures they want to set up, how many entities, what kind of entities, and the location. But we’ve had many meetings where we discussed different solutions, different structures, and so on, and where we heard: ‘Yes we will come, we will have an entity, but we do not yet know whether it is in the one or the other country.’ So, am I surprised about the figure? Well, it’s not a small one. But no, I’m not surprised.  Are you able to put a ballpark figure on it at the moment?  No.  Earlier this week, the Bank of England put out its financial stability report, and in its assessment it thinks that any major disruption to the provision of financial services post-Brexit would hit European institutions harder than it would hit UK financial institutions. Do you accept that assessment?  Well, I always think that modelling these kinds of events, which are one-off events, where you do not have a comparable situation is quite difficult and different people might see it differently. Perhaps I’m more sceptical about these kinds of calculations because I’m a lawyer and not an economist.  Let me ask this. Obviously, Brexit is a massively political question, but I think regulators on both sides are very aware of the financial stability risks. Do you think politicians on both sides are listening to those concerns from people on the ground who actually have to do this on a day-to-day level and will have to be working out the consequences? Do you think enough thought has been given by the politicians to this issue of financial stability?  Well, I can only talk about the European side, as I am not talking to UK politicians, but here I do not see a problem. My impression is that there is an awareness of it, but also, that there are some topics that do need to be addressed and where we have time to address them. All sides should for sure speed up, and it is a challenge. Do not misunderstand me. Brexit is a challenge, but I would not overdo it either.  Have you had any discussions with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK about your working relationship in the future, and how that might be for cooperation?  We have a current working relationship which is good and very intense, and we regularly exchange information with regard to the preparation for the incoming and outgoing banks on both sides. So, I can wholeheartedly say the working relationship couldn’t be better, and I expect it to be as good as that in two or three years, too. When you talk and discuss things with somebody on a regular basis, you just do not lose touch.  What’s your view about whether equivalence is a way forward for, again, outgoing institutions going, if possible, into the UK and institutions from the UK coming into Europe? Do you think equivalence holds the answers, or are you sceptical?  Well, this is not in the remit of the ECB. The equivalence question has to be discussed in the negotiations. It has to be looked at with regard to the regulatory topics in the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive IV; we do not have a foot in that door, except when we will be asked for our legal opinion, but that hasn’t happened yet. Where we really look into equivalence is with regard to negotiating a memorandum of understanding, but this is at the end of the process with the PRA and concerns confidentiality requirements which have to be equivalent in order to be able to exchange information from one supervisor to the other. But this is far from what you are talking about here. You are talking about regulatory equivalence.  Yes.  So, this is something that needs to be done on the political side.  Mark Carney has floated the idea of super equivalence, perhaps at a level determined by the Basel Committee or Financial Stability Board where whole regions would think about equivalence. Do you think that’s a good idea that could be pursued in the future, not just about Brexit, but more generally?  In order to really give an opinion about that I would need to have a little bit more detail around what this super equivalence means. I’m not so sure whether this kind of super equivalence really fits into the Brexit topic. For Brexit, we are talking on the one hand about what kind of rights and what kind of obligations does a country have within the EU where it has all kinds of rights and obligations, and on the other what kind of rights does a country have when it is not within the EU anymore, and does not wish to fulfil obligations linked to these rights.  We wanted to ask about euro clearing as well because, obviously, that was a big subject, particularly two weeks ago when the Commission put out its paper. Would it be the SSM, potentially, that would have oversight of clearing as well, which would be adding to your remit there?  No, we are supervising banks, so if a central counterparty (CCP) would be a bank…  …the oversight sits with the ECB.  The oversight is with the central bank; the supervision of banks is with the SSM. When the CCP is a bank, then there are overlaps. But talking about euro-denominated clearing is talking about financial stability from our perspective, and about transmission of monetary policy. So, it is very important to have smoothly running operations, and until now, because of our very robust arrangements with the Bank of England, and with the CCPs via the European Securities and Markets Authority we have been able to participate in the colleges. By the way, in these colleges for the CCPs, it’s not only the central bank participating but the SSM too, because, as the customers of CCPs are the big banks, and we supervise the big banks, there’s an SSM observer there too. Via these colleges we had information and influence on the relevant decisions for capital, liquidity, risk management, standards, and so on, of the CCPs. At least if we were to think about a hard Brexit, this would change, and so something at least equivalent, depending on the systemic nature of the CCP, has to be ensured.  An equivalent type of college, as it were?  Well, let’s see. It’s the Commission that has to put a proposal to the EU lawmakers, on how to ensure that this financial stability aspect is taken care of.  But you’re broadly happy with this Commission draft paper then, it would be fair to say?  As an Executive Board Member of the ECB, I’m following the developments on this but there are others on the Board working more closely on this than I am, so let’s wait and see.  Can I ask about the Veneto banks and the banking union? What do you think of the treatment of the Veneto banks and EU’s banking union, because clearly it’s raised some big questions over issues such as how the new rules work and about deposit insurance. What’s your personal view? How damaging or otherwise do you think this is to the banking union what’s happened over the past few days?  First of all, we’ve made quite some progress with the banking union. We established European supervision. We established a European Resolution Authority. It is, from my perspective, a long-term project, meaning we need to acknowledge that we might not be there fully yet, but we need to have a long-term perspective to settle all the interpretations possible according to the legal environment. We need to work on a very clear joint direction, on how we implement and transfer the general objectives and ideas. So, I think partly we can be satisfied that we made progress, but we need to acknowledge, too, that there is a longer way to go, a longer path to take. Here and there some improvements should be done. If I may, I can give you some information if you so wish.  Yes, please.  What is really important to say is that this is a long-term project. It should be clearly understood that we are here to stay. We’re not in a situation where a one-size-fits-all approach will work in all cases. I’m pretty sure it’s not the way with things in the UK either, that you settle on one reform and then for the next 50 years you are happy not to improve it. So, for me, the whole minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) topic is a very relevant one. It’s not only the framework, the rules and the technical standards around MREL, but that banks have MREL in their balance sheets is really a very important issue in order to have the banking union moving forward, fulfilling all the expectations. This is really very important for me. As a supervisor we clearly see that the tools we apply need to be improved, too, and I’ll give you two examples. The first example is the moratorium. When you have a bank with problems with liquidity it’s quite helpful to have a moratorium. I’m used to it in Germany; I missed it in Spain. Equally important, to address several problems, is to have a tool which we call ‘deductions from own funds’. This means that if you find that a bank needs to increase its provisions because of risks uncovered in, for example, an on-site inspection, then from a prudential point of view, using the ‘deductions from own funds’ tool, the supervisor would expect that these risks be covered by the bank with more capital. But in the absence of this ‘deduction from own funds’ tool, the bank may take the view that additional provisions are not necessary and instead falls within the range of accounting interpretation.  In terms of provisioning for losses?  No, losses are different. You see, with risk, you have not yet incurred a loss. You see a risk, and in the accounting standards, you can decide how you need to provision it and to what kind of amount. But you can also take a prudential view where you might want a bank to be more conservative in provisioning for risks because you want to push the bank to work out its non-performing loans (NPLs), for example. Then you would like, from a prudential perspective, the bank to cover this risk with higher provisioning. In some countries you have this prudential tool for deducting from own funds already.  Do you think that the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards 9 would help in forcing banks to be more forward-looking in their provisioning of risk?  With regard to the accounting standards, yes, for sure. We are moving from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, so in some years we will have a different way of doing things.  Yes. I think this is pertinent here. One of the key criticisms that’s been raised about the SSM and the process that they’re bringing to the banks is that the declaration of insolvency didn’t come early enough, that we’ve known for several years that there were problems with these banks, and that it wasn’t until last Friday [23 June 2017] that they were declared failing or likely to fail, and that there’s now a greater amount of expense to the taxpayer. Do you think that’s a fair criticism?  Well, I think it’s not. Let me first explain that the failing or likely to fail declaration is not a declaration of insolvency. This is something different. This is the first point. The second point is one where people perhaps do not understand the legal environment correctly. The requirements for failing or likely to fail, apart from the liquidity side – let us focus on the capital side here – very clearly say that if a bank breaches ‘own funds’ then you might declare failing or likely to fail. So, you have discretion. You have not only the right, but you have the obligation, to look into this discretion. There it depends very much on whether a bank breaches the minimum capital requirement or whether it breaches the additional capital requirement set by the supervisor. The minimum capital requirement set by the lawmaker is, as such, stronger. It’s a more important requirement. However, the supervisory Pillar 2 requirements are relevant as well. There’s a threshold too, but it is set by the supervisor, so when Pillar 2 requirements are breached, rather than the minimum capital requirements, the supervisor needs to apply the proportionality principle: supervisors need to give the bank time to rectify the deficiencies, to find a solution. A breach might occur from a forward-looking perspective, and if so, then the supervisor tells the bank it has to provide a capital plan which shows the possibilities to counter this breach, to restore capital again. Now, you have to look into the capital situation of these banks, which are public, and their capital increases in recent years. We were quite insistent on addressing the risks in both banks, which led to the need for capital increases. And then the last time there was a question of a capital increase, additional questions arose: who would be the investors, what kind of business plan would work, what kind of restructuring would be necessary, in short, what kind of prospects would the banks have? It was clear-cut that there was no adequate solution, and so then we had to act. If Pillar 1 is breached the supervisors have to act much faster, but with Pillar 2, which is set by the supervisors themselves, there are different obligations.  Does this not create problems for the banking union then, because you’ve got a system where – even if these rules had been followed to the letter – the spirit of the new rules, and banking union, was this idea that taxpayers weren’t on the hook. And you need that in order to be able to push for deposit insurance in a next step. Instead, it now looks like taxpayers are once again on the hook.  That is the second part.  But would it not be less expensive for the taxpayer if you were able to declare the bank failing or likely to fail sooner, because there’s a situation now where the bill is €17 billion, whereas if you were able to do it in a shorter timeframe you would find that the taxpayer bill would be a lot smaller.  That is a question of balance. On the one hand, and I fully agree, a supervisor has to be forward-looking. That’s why the question with regard to the deduction from own funds is a correct one. I fully agree that a supervisor has to be forward-looking, and we are forward-looking within the legal framework given to us. So, it is on the one hand a question of how fast and how strong you act with the ultima ratio measure – that is, naming a bank failing or likely to fail – and on the other hand, when you act, you infringe on the laws of the investors because a bail-in means you expropriate. So, the shareholders, the junior and senior debtors, depending on what is done later in the resolution, have their rights too. They are expropriated. So, you have to get the timing right, which is not always that easy. Let me be very clear: in how much or whether the taxpayer is then affected is not within our remit. This is then the question of how resolution is done and what kind of decisions are taken after the declaration of failing or likely to fail.  It goes to Elke König [Chair of the Single Resolution Board (SRB)] at that point.  Yes, or the national resolution authority (NRA). They have to decide how they want to solve the case after the failing or likely to fail declaration. This is nothing we can decide.  So you felt as though you had to say at the start of this year, in January, that this was a solvent bank, even though there were Pillar 2 concerns, while Pillar 1 was okay.  Well, as I said, the question of failing or likely to fail and the question of solvency are not fully overlapping. It’s not two sides of the one coin because solvency is something you state at a point in time. You have to ask whether there are no more prospects to solve an actual or likely Pillar 2 breach. This is because you have to give the investors and other stakeholders the possibility to rectify a solution to ensure that the bank does not fail.  The other loophole that seems to need to be closed is a legal one, the definition of public interest. The Italian government used the provision that it was in the public interest to do it this way. Is that not a legal question that needs to be sorted out as well, whether governments can decide: ‘Okay, well, we’ve got all these rules about too big to fail, but you know what? We’ll ignore them because it’s in the public interest to do it this way.’  Well, I can imagine that there will be a discussion about this in the next year. Where do we have a joint understanding, a joint interpretation of public interest? That’s what I meant when I stated we’ve made many, many steps towards the objective, and we’ve achieved quite a lot. But we are not yet fully there.  One thing people are interested in is this declaration by the SRB that resolving these banks was not in the public interest.  What the SRB has to do is to answer the question of the public interest. Not every systemically relevant institution, according to the SSM regulation, has to be resolved via the SRB. When there is no public interest, it has to go to the NRA.  There’s been some reports in the Spanish press in recent days about the situation with Banco Popular that it may have, in fact, had some collateral that it could have used to access liquidity which was not known in the past. How much of a concern is that for you that there wasn’t as much of a liquidity shortage in that instance as may have appeared to be?  I did not understand the question. We have a confidentiality regime, so I cannot talk about single banks and reveal information about single banks if this information was not yet publicly disclosed by the bank itself. What exactly were you asking about?  The issue is that the reason behind the decision on Popular seemed to be that the liquidity position had deteriorated very quickly.  Yes, and there was no prospect for a change in that situation.  So, the issue which seems to be talked about now is that Popular may have had some more collateral that it could have used to access central bank liquidity, at least that’s what I understand from reports in the Spanish press. What’s the general position on how bad the liquidity issue needs to be before you can invoke this failing or likely to fail?  I cannot answer because I’m not allowed to answer individual bank queries, but perhaps I’ll just quote some rules so that you can make your own assessment. First of all, again, when you look at capital and when you look at liquidity, it’s not only that there needs to be a certain kind of deterioration, but you also need to assess and examine that there are no private means, that there are no prospects anymore that the situation can be turned around. When we are talking about central bank liquidity the collateral has to be eligible, it has to be there, and it has to be given to the central bank in order for it to be able to then give central bank liquidity to the bank.   Just closer to home, what’s your position on the banks that are struggling with shipping loans? How close is that issue to being resolved?  This is a very good example of what the SSM can do that others in NCAs can’t do. It’s about getting an overview and looking at the standards, which banks might not meet the standards in a certain area, and then raising the bar for everybody. We looked into the shipping loans, for the last two-and-a-half years. We had a special project, and made quite a few on-site inspections and off-site analyses, and established a new tool there. In fact, it is a nice tool. It gets those supervisors’ eyes sparkling. All across countries ship financing is project financing. It’s an international activity, so it does not have much to do with national specificities. It rather depends on whether you have bulkers, tankers or container ships. Do you have large ships? Do you have old ships or new ships? So, it’s very focused on the specificity of the project financing. We made huge progress in this area and raised the bar for many banks. We got a very good insight and took this knowledge for our NPL guidance, too, in order to ensure that banks do not only have an idea of their NPL exposure, but that they also have a strategy, that they have a governance around it. Very interesting.  Given that you now have this new, great tool and all of this information, how concerned are you? Do you think banks are making decent progress in this area?  Many banks are making decent progress in this area. We experienced this in the whole NPL topic, as such, not only shipping. When the supervisor focuses on a topic where you ask not only what kind of strategies do you have, but you ask the bank: ‘What are your targets, where do you want to be in the next year, and in 2018, and 2019 and 2020? What are your tools and how do you do the workout and what kind of staff do you have?’ Then this raises awareness in the banks too, and the way banks deal with these issues. It gets much more focused, especially in the NPL exposure topic we see progress made. The same we had, by the way, with Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 239. With this risk aggregation we got a lot of very positive feedback from banks saying because we compared them horizontally, we could then tell the banks: ‘You are below or above the standard’. This helped the banks quite a lot to push the issue internally.  Can we ask about the MREL, which you mentioned in relation to recovery and resolution? It seems that the large banks are on track to raise the MREL required. What about the mid-sized and the smaller banks? Are you worried about how much they have to contribute?  This is a very idiosyncratic question. It depends very much on the individual banks. I cannot tell you that everything is fine, because here and there some homework still needs to be done, and there’s some time left so this is not the biggest issue. Many banks depend on the national legal environment too. It is very idiosyncratic.  Just going back to the Italian banks again, how comfortable are you? How much progress has been made on the NPL issue? Is it the case that six months down the line another Italian bank is going to be in trouble or do you think progress has been made in this area? The NPL issue has dragged on for a while.  It’s very clear that the NPL topic will not be solved in two, three months, or in one year, but this is something that we need to work on in a medium-term perspective. What I think is very important – and we are working on it – is that the solutions are not only with the banks, but with the national governments too. This is also a question of the legal environment: the judicial situation is of utmost importance for the price, for the value of a NPL, and how fast a workout can be done. We made a very interesting stocktake last year of eight of the most relevant countries in terms of NPLs. In the stocktake we asked: ‘How supportive is the legal environment and the judicial environment for a workout of NPLs? And how important is it for a country with a lot of NPLs?’ We knew that it is important, but we were quite surprised just how important it is and what kind of heterogeneity we found. I’m a lawyer. I knew that it is very heterogeneous, but we found huge varieties regarding, for example, the repossession of collateral. So, we had countries where there was collateral for the loans, but you were not able to repossess the collateral. So, in this case the collateral is worth nothing. And it is crucial how long you need for the workout, to repossess. There are countries where it is a year or one-and-a-half years, and there are countries where you need 12 years. Just to give you an idea of the value of an NPL. When you’d like to sell NPLs, the value of these NPLs is partly driven by how fast you can do the workout.  But I think funds seeking to buy NPLs also feel a little bit tentative because of what happened in Greece, as well. I think they are more tentative about coming into Italy if their legal rights aren’t fully established and can be revoked as well. I think that’s also a fear for them.  That is the legal environment.  Exactly.  That is exactly what I meant. You need to have what we call in Germany legal certainty. You need legal certainty, and the certainty that you do not need ten years to go through all the judicial instances, but that you have a right already after the first court decision. And even if you have the law – and that’s why I would like the countries not only to implement changes in the legal environment but the judicial one too – because if you do not have the staff to then implement the law, it doesn’t help either. If you have the laws but then you need to wait for eight years because there is no judge, it does not help either. And if there is no judge the cases pile up, and you can count them as they come in. If the number of judges does not increase, you will be queuing for eight years. Germans sometimes do not know how great our bureaucracy is. I give you an idea: it is worth money. People are profit centres. Economically it is a profit centre. I think in Germany it takes one year to get a repossession of collateral.  Thank you so much.   "
2017-06-28,Vítor Constâncio,Interview with CNBC,"Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach in Sintra on 27 June, published 28 June 2017","  Interview with CNBC   Interview with Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Annette Weisbach in Sintra on 27 June, published 28 June 2017  Mr Constâncio, we're talking about a lot of economic issues here in Sintra: the output gap, productivity, but also innovation. What does that all mean for your monetary policy?  Constâncio: Beyond the point that these are important subjects for any economy looking ahead, it's also important for monetary policy because this concept of output gap dimension – which is the difference between where output is at the moment compared with the potential output as it could be – this is a very important concept for monetary policy decisions, because what we want when we want to, say, bring inflation closer to 2%, is for aggregate demand to put pressure on supply in order for prices to go up. And when the difference between the actual output and the potential is negative, as is the case, then we have to close that difference.  That difference depends on the way we see and calculate the potential, which is a very difficult issue in economics, and there are all sorts of different estimates, but what it means is that all central banks have to analyse very carefully and take a view on what is the degree of slack in the economy, because that's crucial for the stance of monetary policy being more expansionary, less expansionary: it depends on that. So all this discussion about potential growth, productivity going forward, all that is important to see where this slack in our economies is going, and to take, then, monetary policy decisions.  Slack in the economy seems to be the buzzword also here in Sintra. Listening to the President's speech, of course slack is super-important to determine whether we can look through a period of low inflation, so where do we stand here now? Can we look through it, or is it still worrisome, where we stand when it comes to inflation?  Constâncio: It's very difficult for any central bank to have a very firm view on the slack. All central banks struggle to interpret where exactly is the situation, and in central banks we use many variables to try to gauge what is this slack, this difference that is in the economy. What we can say now is that what we observe is that domestic factors of inflation, starting with wage costs and then also price decisions, are not responding the way we would expect in view of what are the more common estimates of this slack. So we have to ask ourselves – are these measures of the economy correct? Should we look to other variables?  The President, in the speech, precisely pointed out that looking to unemployment as an indicator of this slack in the economy, the unemployment rate now is 9.3%, according to the normal international standard of measuring unemployment; but if we adopt, as in the US, a broader concept of unemployment – which in the US they call U6 – then unemployment in the euro area is at 18%, where it is at 9% in the case of the US. Which would imply that the slack is then bigger than we could judge some time ago. That being the case, it justifies fully what the President said at the end of his speech: that we need persistence. If we want to bring inflation to our target of below but close to 2%, then we have to persist in the type of monetary policy that we have been adopting.  But looking at the market reaction, the market took the speech quite hawkish, meaning concentrating on the optimistic comments about inflation, the economy, perhaps also the political tailwind. So is the market right to read your communication style as more hawkish than before?  Constâncio: It's always very difficult to interpret the reaction of markets. I will not try to say rationalise or explain; the reaction of the market was what it was. But I will say that the speech of the President, if one reads it completely, it's totally in line with the statement we had in Tallinn in our monetary policy meeting there; the speech that he also made at the European Parliament; and here it was along the same lines. He recalled that domestic drivers of inflation, measured by the underlying inflation, are still subdued, and that we need to be sure that when we get to inflation close to 2% it's a durable situation and a self-sustained situation that can go on without the high degree of accommodation that we have now: so all these conditions, he reaffirmed them, and then talked precisely about the need to persist and about the need to be prudent in talking about premature withdrawal of stimulus.  So in other words we are not closer to an exit, not even a baby step closer, with the forum here in Sintra?  Constâncio: Well, we are not predicting what the Governing Council will do. We are not trying to do that. This is the assessment that we have been producing also as a result of monetary policy meetings of the Governing Council itself, like the more recent one we had. So it's going along the same lines. Personally, I don't see anything in the speech that would be different from, say, the previous two main interventions about monetary policy done by the President.  Let us talk about one area of optimism, and that's the political tailwind. How confident are you about the state of the political European landscape now? Is there more of a momentum for reforms now?  Constâncio: Crises are always bad for the social and political mood, and recoveries are always good. And so there is a bit of a recovery, which is becoming stronger, and that, of course, has had its effects, in the mood of societies, of public opinion, and also in the political sphere. That's what I think the President indicated, and indeed, there were fears, especially from outsiders, that some of the political developments in some European countries would go in the direction of creating some doubts, which were dispelled. So that's what he refers to.  But throughout all this period there is one thing that is important to recall: if you go to the Eurobarometer that is the result of surveys in all Member States, you see throughout all these years, all these years, that the support for the euro – being in favour of the single currency, the euro – has been stable at around 70% of Europeans in the euro area countries; and that in all countries there was a majority supporting the euro. A majority in all countries. The numbers are different according to the different countries, but in all they are the majority. So this has been the support that the project has benefited from, and the present recovery has indeed reinforced those views.  But we are talking about reforms as well. We're talking about the banking sector: the European banking sector is not as strong as it should be. Just over the weekend we have seen two Italian banks getting state aid, so it was hugely criticised. Why did they get that exception, that they're allowed to have state aid?  Constâncio: It is not an exception. Everything is foreseen in the laws. BRRD, the directive on resolution of banks, was not applied because the Single Resolution Mechanism decided that these two banks did not deserve to be resolved, which according to European law means rescuing some part of the banks, and that the banks should go into liquidation. But going into liquidation means that state aid rules apply, so any public money then requires two things. It requires that shareholders and subordinated debt-holders participate in the costs, which is the case in the two banks, because they go to the entity with the bad assets…  But not senior bond holders?  Constâncio: No, but the point – if the solution, for instance, under BRRD, had been applying precautionary recapitalisation in that case also senior bond holders would not have been bailed in. So it's not much difference from a situation of precautionary recap, which is foreseen in the law. It's not an exception. It's not a special privilege. Everything was decided according to the two laws that apply in these cases, with, in the case of the BRRD, the potential exception of precautionary recap, which is in the law, and state aid rules. This was applied. At the same time, as a result of state aid rules, and logic, policy, the overall capacity of the banking sector in Italy went down. So there was downsizing; there was restructuring. Indeed, everything was applied according to European legislation.  Is that just the beginning now for the Italian banking sector? As we all know, it has a huge slab of NPLs. Can we be prepared for more of these kind of…  Constâncio: I don't anticipate anything of that sort. There is the situation which was announced also during these days that is about to be concluded regarding Monte dei Paschi di Siena, but that has been discussed with the European authorities, and very likely it will have, as was stated in the past few days, a solution very soon for that case.

2017-06-22,Peter Praet,Interview with Der Spiegel,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stefan Kaiser on 19 June 2017 and published on 22 June 2017","  Interview with Der Spiegel   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stefan Kaiser on 19 June 2017 and published on 22 June 2017  Mr Praet, you are a Belgian who was born in Germany and who spent the first years of your childhood here. Can you understand why so many people here regard the European Central Bank (ECB) as the greatest threat to their personal wealth?  I think the German public is much more impartial on that point. Most people understand the position we are in: we have to define the right monetary policy for a monetary union with very different countries. The press often criticises us for this, but the personal discussions I have here are much more courteous and relaxed. Even the discussions within the ECB’s Governing Council are very good, even when there are critical voices.  But it’s the Germans who complain most about the ECB, isn’t it?  Of course, criticism in Germany is somewhat more vocal than in other countries. That also has to do with Germany’s role in the financial and euro crisis. Because, on the one hand, it had already undertaken important reforms and was in a stronger position. And because, on the other hand, the people of Germany are by tradition not so highly indebted. That’s a cultural thing – and I very much share it. But it’s also a factor that played a role in the origin of the crisis.  How?  It concerns the creditor-debtor relationship: before the crisis, Germany was a significant lender to other countries. German savers invested, mainly via their banks, a lot of money abroad – in those countries where households and companies had bigger debts, for example Spain. And the crisis came and the money flowed back – €400 billion came back from Spain alone and a large part of that originated in German savings. The ECB made liquidity available to banks in exchange for collateral. That prevented a meltdown of the financial system, which otherwise would have led to strongly deflationary pressure across the euro area.  So Germany was also saved by the ECB?  In Germany, one might say that it’s obvious that debtors have to pay back what they owe. But the lenders also bear a responsibility. They too should be careful. The Germans are complaining about the interest rates being so low. We understand that. But they also have to bear in mind that lenders were very well protected in and after the crisis – and that none of Germany’s large neighbours slipped into a depression. That too would have had a serious impact on the economy, not least in Germany.   What do you say to those people who put money to one side month by month in order to be able to afford a little something when they get older – but whose plans won’t work out now because of the zero interest rates?   We have studied how the low interest rates affect the disposable income of households, including in Germany. People not only earn interest on their savings, but they also borrow money – for example, if they buy a house. And the results show that the advantages offset the disadvantages.  So there’s no reason to complain?  Yes there is, because of course not everyone benefits. All monetary policy decisions have undesirable distributional effects as well. Consider, for example, the equity markets, where prices have risen dramatically. In Germany, those suffering most from the low interest rates are middle-aged people who own a small fortune and have invested it largely in savings accounts and in interest-bearing securities – i.e. it’s not very diversified.  Are you telling Germans that their money would be better invested in shares?   Of course I’m not giving investment tips; I’m a central banker. And to be honest, I invest my money in a similar way to most Germans.  In Germany, some economists are already warning about the economy overheating – and in many other countries in the euro area, the recovery is now evident. Isn’t it the right time to exit from the policy of extremely cheap money?  As a central bank, we conduct monetary policy for the whole of the euro area – and this policy has been working. There is a broad-based recovery happening and it will probably continue. Germany has made a bit more progress than others in that respect. The output gap is closing, in other words, Germany’s economy is exploiting its potential virtually to the full. Surprisingly, prices are still rising slowly. But this will change over the short or long term. And it will help to trigger a change in monetary policy. So there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Before you raise the key interest rates, you intend to wind down government bond purchases from the current €60 billion per month to zero. But can it be done so easily? The bond spreads for countries such as Italy might once again shoot upwards, as during the euro crisis.  If the spreads for a particular country rise, that’s not a monetary policy problem. We are not singling out particular countries and neither are we there to ensure governments have favourable financing conditions. When the day comes, we will look at inflation and act accordingly, regardless of whether governments complain. We forewarned them and they clearly understood that. I have just read a commentary by the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pier Carlo Padoan. “When the bond purchases come to an end, we are on our own”, he writes. And he’s right.  Italy is currently in any case the euro area’s problem child. Nowhere else is the economy growing so slowly; nowhere else are the banks sitting on so many non-performing loans. How serious is the situation?  Indeed, the Italian economy hasn’t grown for 20 years. Real GDP per capita – taking inflation into account – has stagnated over that period. Italy therefore has a deep-seated problem. The government is addressing that, but it also has to convince people to support the reforms. In fact, the economy has great potential, with very many creative enterprises.  Until now, Greece was always the euro area’s shakiest prospect. But the country has just agreed on new loans and further debt relief with its international creditors. Observers are now expecting the ECB to also accept Greek government bonds in its purchase programme. They have been excluded until now because of doubts about the sustainability of the country's debt.  Before we change any aspects of the asset purchase programme, we need to conduct our own analysis of Greece’s debt sustainability. We will not rely on others for that. Whether it’s the European Stability Mechanism or the European Commission, everyone has their own perspective. But when it comes to buying bonds, we have to take a look for ourselves.  That means the answer is “no”?  That means we have to take a look for ourselves.   The Brexit negotiations started this week. From an economist's perspective, how important is it that the EU and the United Kingdom reach an agreement?  Extremely important. When we say that the economic outlook for the euro area is good and that risks are broadly balanced, that doesn’t mean that there are no risks. There is currently a lot of uncertainty about the direction of the United States’ economic policy in the coming months. We now have a good sense of how things will develop in China, but not in the United States. And it’s a fairly similar story with the United Kingdom. It shows how a country can create severe difficulties for itself. Europe offers a robust institutional framework, including for trade. The internal market works and is very important. And now the United Kingdom is leaving it and heading for great uncertainty.  What can the negotiations achieve?   In my opinion, the British have made a huge mistake. Populist forces have stirred up people’s fears and fear is not a good counsellor. The damage is done, the British economy is already slowing down. Now it is just about minimising the negative impact. I hope there will still be a reasonably sensible solution.  Does US policy also concern you a lot?   Not many major decisions have been made there yet, unlike in the United Kingdom. And I hope that, in the end, reason will prevail. In general we should not get mixed up in power politics where everyone only seeks their own advantage. Ultimately, the danger is that large countries dictate deals to the others. That would be catastrophic. We need strong international institutions. And we again need a unified Europe. Because the weaker Europe is, the more dangerous it will be for us.  "
2017-06-12,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Bloomberg,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua on 12 June 2017","  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Francine Lacqua on 12 June 2017  Benoît Cœuré, thank you so much for speaking to Bloomberg TV. Now, the ECB seems to be in a rush to exit this accommodative stance. How dangerous is lower for longer?  Thank you for inviting me. Basically the thrust of what the Governing Council decided last week is to acknowledge the improving economic circumstances, to translate it into a revised forward guidance, because we have to adapt to economic reality, but also to give a sense of patience when it comes to rates being low: we are still not seeing inflation where we would like it to be; we're still not seeing the criteria that we've set for inflation to be sustainable all being met. So you need a sense of patience here.  How much of a nightmare is stronger GDP on QE?  Stronger GDP is good news. It’s unqualified good news. This has been acknowledged by the Governing Council last week, and that’s why we changed our communication to adapt to the changing reality. It also shows that our monetary policy measures are working. All the jobs that have been created in the eurozone over the last three, four years or so, a lot of them have been created thanks to the accommodative monetary policy stance, so it is working very well. Now, we have an inflation mandate, so when it comes to the next steps we’ll have to focus on inflation.  Why was tapering not discussed last week?  That wasn’t discussed at all. It is too early to discuss it. We have to acknowledge the changing reality. We discussed a lot the economic situation; we discussed the prospects for inflation. There was a sense of progress also when it comes to inflation where, in spite of the inflation being revised downwards, if you look carefully at the staff forecast, you’ll see that inflation is also less dependent on our monetary policy measures, which is one step in the right direction, but it’s not yet quite enough to start discussing tapering. We’re not there yet.  When do you think tapering needs to be discussed? Even to just accustom the markets to the idea of tapering.  I don’t want to give dates here. I don't think it serves a purpose. The reason being that we’re very much data-driven. We’re driven by facts. So we’ll discuss tapering whenever we see the economic situation and the prospects for inflation are right for discussing it.  Do you have in your mind a perfect idea – and I’m not going to press you on it, but do you have a perfect idea of when tapering should be discussed and what it would look like?  No, again, that will depend a lot on the economic numbers; it will depend a lot on inflation. We obviously have to discuss it before the end of the year. That’s obvious given what we’ve said on buying bonds until the end of the year and later if necessary. So that discussion will take place, but it will take place when the data supports it.  Is July a live meeting? I know we were talking about it, but is it a live meeting given that it’s July so there’s actually usually low volatility in the markets, and given that you’re not actually doing any new forecasts?  Well, we do work in July. It may look nice around, but we do work in July. And as I said, the discussion last week was very much about taking stock of the progress in the economy, taking stock of the progress that will support an improved path for inflation, and that’s a discussion that we’ll have again and again. So one lesson of what we’ve decided last week, is that the Governing Council wants to keep our forward guidance aligned with reality, and that’s going to continue.  You’re one of the brightest minds when it comes to academic economics. Why is inflation so low? Is it structural, or is it just that we may be counting things differently?  No, I don’t think it’s that much about the statistics. That may play a role, but it’s a lot about the changing structures of the labour market, in particular. This is a recovery which is jobs-rich. A lot of jobs have been created and are being created in the eurozone economy, but it’s a different kind of jobs. A lot of them are on temporary contracts, a lot of them are part-time, and this produces less inflationary pressures. There will be a time where they are consolidated into permanent, full-time contracts, and then nominal wages will start growing, but we’re not yet there. So it has a lot to do with the structure of the job market, and that’s certainly an area where we’re paying a lot of attention, to understand in detail the nature of the jobs being created.  Do you think the market understands all of these nuances quite well, especially when it comes to when you talk about tapering and exactly what kind of potential roads that may take?  I think it’s very well understood. The markets have the example of the Fed in the US; it has to be different here, because we are operating on different markets, but we have a successful experience with policy normalisation. We’ve been able to communicate our intentions. The market reaction to the Governing Council last week was very positive, very smooth. So I’m not very worried here.  Yes, but that’s because you didn’t announce much. Is there a danger that when you do announce something a little bit more substantive that the markets go haywire?  Well, we did change our communication, and that was a significant change, and the market understood very well, I think.  Give me a sense of, when you talk about forward guidance, and we talked about the data points, and everything seems very, very clear: are there parallels with the Fed when it comes to inflation just not being as strong as you were hoping it would be?  I don't think so, because the economies are different. I was mentioning the labour market earlier on: the labour market has been very different in the US and in Europe. In the US the participation rate has fallen, so a lot of workers have been detached from the labour market, or disenfranchised from the labour market. They’re just staying at home, and have lost any hope to find a job. That is not the case in Europe. So we’ll have also to account for these differences.  On a trade-weighted basis, the euro is that much stronger compared to the dollar: is that a concern at all? Do you think about it, or not?  Well, we don’t have an exchange rate target, and insofar as exchange rate movements do reflect the economic fundamental situation, that’s fine, so there’s nothing to comment at the stage we’re at.  Compared to six months ago, what is the risk that you still perceive – forecasts are a lot better, right? So it seems that things are getting rosier.  Well, the Governing Council has judged last week that risks were now balanced, and also added that we see downside risks mostly coming from the outside. So we see risks surrounding the future course of US economic policies, we see risks in emerging market economies, and these are the risks we want to focus on. Risks coming from the inside, that is, from within the eurozone economy, are much less than they used to be.  How would you qualify tensions within the Governing Council? I know there are different views, but is that healthy? It seems like you’re becoming more like an MPC BoE monetary style…  It is healthy to have different views. We are working for 19 countries, so we need different views to be reflected. Different economies inside the eurozone are running at different paces, and that has to be reflected. So, so far so good, as long as the Governing Council can form a consensus. And what we’ve decided last week was very much a consensus, which is good and gives strength to our communication.  How do you rate political concerns? Is there a danger that because France is out of the way and it was an outcome that the markets like, that we now underestimate political risk?  Well, political risk is there. It’s not for us to decide on political risks. We’re not a political institution; we don’t decide based on political outcomes. We decide based on economic facts, and political timelines should certainly not be in our way when we have to decide on monetary policy. That said, it’s true that political uncertainty has held back consumption and investment to some extent in the eurozone. I very much hope that in France this will not be the case any more. That will certainly support the strength of the French economy. I also very much hope that the outcome of the French election can support a momentum of reform, starting in France, obviously, but also in Europe, that will support our monetary policy. We want a stronger eurozone for our monetary policy to be effective, and France has a key role to play here.  When it comes to fiscal policies, Mario Draghi has been asking for fiscal policies for as long as I can remember: why would it be different this time?  It’s not that much about fiscal policies; it’s a lot about structural policies. It’s about improving labour markets, and, as I said, it’s about making the eurozone work better, which is a political discussion, which the ECB cannot lead, and should not lead, because we are not a political institution. We don’t have a mandate to do that. So we need eurozone Member States, starting with Germany and with France, to lead the discussion, and I very much hope, I’m very confident now, that that discussion will start.  Does the UK election last week make your job harder or easier?  Well, the UK is not so important for the eurozone economy. I wish the best for the UK economy; I certainly trust the Bank of England to steer the economy through this political uncertainty, but at the end that’s not a major risk for us.  What does it mean for clearing houses?  Clearing houses is an important discussion. That discussion has to be led by the European Commission, because that’s about law-making in Europe. The European Commission will, within days, I guess, make new proposals when it comes to derivatives and to clearing houses, with an objective to ensure the safety and soundness of clearing across the EU when the UK leaves. So far, we’ve been able to ensure the safety and soundness of euro-denominated clearing through very robust arrangements that we have with the Bank of England and with the CCPs located in London, and that works very well. The basis for the arrangements will fall in 2019, when the UK leaves, and so we need an alternative. Different alternatives are considered by the European Commission, and they have to lead that discussion. So I would defer to the Commission here.  Right, but countries want basically sovereignty over that, and the ECB, the Governing Council, I believe, the best person to regulate that is yourselves. How do you think it will end up?  The Governing Council, the ECB has a stake in that discussion, insofar as financial stability is concerned, and insofar as monetary policy transmission is concerned, and we have a statutory role as central bank of issue for euro-denominated transactions, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has referred to the role that we should play as central bank of issue, and we certainly need to play a strong role here. But when it comes to requirements which will be hard-wired into European law – so say, for instance, location: do we need location? – that’s for the Commission to have a say. That’s not for us to decide.  Give me a sense of what happens with Greece.  Greece will be discussed in the Eurogroup in Luxembourg on Thursday this week. That’s another of a long series of meetings. I very much hope, and the ECB very much hopes, that this will be the concluding meeting that will make more precise the way the Greek debt will be addressed by the Eurogroup. The Greek government has done its part. They have done their part in terms of policies, in terms of the MOU, and now it’s for Eurogroup ministers to deliver when it comes to confirming the sustainability of Greek debt. As I said earlier, it wouldn’t serve a purpose to keep the Greek economy in limbo for one more year. We need a decisive act by the Eurogroup that will create confidence in the Greek economy. It’s time for investors to come back in Greece, it’s time for depositors to bring back their money to Greek banks, and it’s for the Eurogroup to give the signal that will make it possible.  So you think the resolution this week will be something that’s acceptable to the ECB?  Well, another discussion will be about the monetary policy consequences and inclusion of Greek debt into QE. That’s a different discussion. It is a monetary policy discussion. So the Governing Council will take whatever will come out of the Eurogroup, and this will be considered and assessed against our rules. We’re certainly not going to be part of a political quid pro quo with the Eurogroup. These are two different discussions.  I know we’re going round the world in 15 minutes. Give me a sense of banks and how concerned you still are about Italian banks. The resolution last week that we had in Spain, is it a blueprint for how you think Italian bank problems should be resolved?  I’m very hesitant to pass judgment, or even pass a comment, on Italian banks. I’m not a supervisor, and we have a separation principle that it’s for my colleagues on the supervisory side to assess and communicate. So Danièle Nouy and Sabine Lautenschläger will do that. When it comes to the resolution of Popular last week, the main lesson is that we have a system that works, so that is a positive test for the institutional set-up that we have, with the Single Resolution Board, European Commission, Single Supervisory Mechanism, and ECB in its monetary policy function: that cooperation has worked very well, in a very swift way, which is what you want to see in the case of resolution. Would that be the case for any other bank? I don't know. All banks are different, and, well, you know that quote from Leo Tolstoy, who said that all happy families are alike, and every unhappy family is different. So every failed bank is different.   Very diplomatic. One very last question, because we haven’t talked about China at all: when it comes to external factors, how should we look at China?  China remains a major area of interest for us. I would not say of concern, or risk, because so far the Chinese authorities have been able to steer the transition in the Chinese system very well, and to provide stability to the world economy. That said, there are issues to be addressed: shadow banking, corporate debt, transition towards domestic demand, transition towards a decarbonised economy. These are daunting challenges that will stay with us in the years to come, but so far the Chinese authorities have been very successful in steering the economy and not making China become an issue for the global economy. We’ve got enough issues, so we don’t want China to become one of them.  "
2017-05-23,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with L’Obs,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Sophie Fay and Pascal Riché on 15 May, and published on 23 May 2017","  Interview with L’Obs   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Sophie Fay and Pascal Riché on 15 May, and published on 23 May 2017  In the United States, the administration wants to reconsider the banking regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. The United Kingdom is tempted to do the same in the context of Brexit. In France, Emmanuel Macron also thinks that the steps taken were excessive. Is this a threat to the stability of the financial system?  Yes, the threat of deregulation exists. In many places there appears to be a temptation to revisit the financial regulation adopted by the G20 countries, which has been a huge project: we have strengthened the capital requirements and liquidity of banks, limited their size, regulated potentially dangerous products, such as derivatives, and started to put in order what’s known as shadow banking, which takes place outside the banking sector. It comes as no surprise that the financial industry dislikes these new rules. The large banks say that they hinder lending and increase the cost of capital. But this is not the case in the euro area, and even less so in France. Banks have significantly strengthened their capital base since 2010 and yet they have never made so many loans at such low rates. The temptation of a regulatory race to the bottom exists in any industry, but it is even stronger in finance. It took enormous political energy on the part of the Heads of State or Government, following the financial crisis, not to give in to it. But whenever this political will weakens, the temptation of a race to the bottom returns. Such a temptation exists in the United States, although for the time being the new administration has not expressed any desire to backtrack on financial cooperation, either in the G7 or the G20, which is comforting.   Emmanuel Macron has also said that he wants to reconsider certain banking rules, notably on the required level of own funds.  His comment was born of good intentions: to facilitate the financing of SMEs. But there are other instruments available for that purpose. It would be useful if, once a year, the ministers of finance and economic affairs of the EU were to examine the impact of regulation on the financing of businesses. But that must not be a pretext for dismantling what has been achieved at international level.  Don’t technocrats have too much power now in relation to these issues?  The agreements reached in the Basel Committee, which brings together central banks and supervisory authorities, have to be transposed into national law. As such, they are not binding. Politicians can always take back control. They are the ones who draw up and adopt the banking regulations. Should international technocratic fora be more transparent? Yes, probably. Mario Draghi has agreed to keep the European Parliament better informed about ongoing discussions.  What needs to be done in order to limit the porous boundaries between the banking sector and the world of politics?   In Europe, the answer is simple: the banking union should be taken seriously. The essence of the project is to “denationalise” supervision of large banks by entrusting it to the ECB, in order to harmonise supervisory methods and create distance between the supervisor and the supervised entity. Before the banking union, regulation and supervision of banks in each country was a kind of ecosystem, a co-production between the banks, the government and the banking supervisor. And we saw the results: some banks took excessive risks in the markets, while others, which were no longer viable, continued without sufficient supervision to finance projects which no longer made economic sense. Taxpayers had to clean up the mess. The banking union reduces the sociological proximity between banks and the administrative and political powers.  As regards “sociological proximity”, the new French President is a former banker. Will the ECB will be more vigilant with regard to him?  One should avoid accusations. Georges Pompidou and Henri Emmanuelli also worked for Rothschild! The French political authorities were in the vanguard of the banking union: it is an achievement and it was not self-evident in France. What matters today is continuing in that direction.  Is financial deregulation a factor in the rise of inequality, as some are saying?  Financial regulation has its rightful place within a framework for combating inequality. As the economists Philippe Aghion and Angus Deaton have said, combating inequality involves combating rent-seeking. And yet the big forces of change today, globalisation and technological progress, create rents. Tackling these is not easy, because there are “good” and “bad” rents. If we want innovation to flourish, rent-seeking has to be accepted, at least temporarily.  Rent-seeking that obtains patents, for instance…  Yes. In order to encourage people to innovate they need to be able to enjoy the fruits of their innovation. But if rents are excessive, a minority appropriates the benefits of globalisation and technological progress. Finance is necessary to fund innovation, but it may itself become an excessive source of rent-seeking.   How?  Large financial institutions naturally tend to grow in size in order to exploit economies of scale, diversify, and reduce their financing costs. If they are too large, that creates a problem of competition and this creates rents. It also encourages a phenomenon specific to finance: being “too big to fail”. A large financial institution may take unreasonable risks because it knows that the public authorities will have no choice but to rescue it if something goes wrong… That race for size must be avoided by way of regulation. Another phenomenon specific to finance is rents being built up by individuals. A proportion of financial industry employees are remunerated at unreasonable levels when measured against their value to society, as Thomas Philippon and Ariell Reshef have clearly shown. This misappropriation is socially unjust and must be regulated. Hence the EU legislation aimed at regulating the distribution of bonuses. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have gone further in making senior bank managers criminally liable in the event of excessive risk-taking or lack of control. It is a political choice. France also could do it.  All these rules reduce the risk of financial crises, which tend to deepen inequality. Too often in the past, taxpayers have borne the cost of bank recapitalisation post-crisis. And banking crises, by causing economic activity and employment to fall, hit the most vulnerable in our societies the hardest. Europe is endeavouring, with a set of new rules, to avoid the costs of these crises being borne by taxpayers, by calling on bank shareholders and creditors.  What is Europe doing otherwise to combat inequality?  To reduce inequality, redistribution instruments are needed, i.e. taxes and transfers. Only a legitimate, elected parliament can decide to tax some people to give to others. At global level, such a legislature obviously does not exist. At European level, it does. This is an extraordinary opportunity! It should be used effectively. The paradox of globalisation is that the greater the need for redistribution instruments, the more they are called into question. For example, it is becoming increasingly difficult to tax large companies, which are now operating on a global scale. The European Commission’s action in relation to Apple in Ireland is a good example of what needs to be done to regain control of globalisation. And its plan to harmonise the corporate tax base is a move in the same direction.  The planets finally seem to be aligned in a way that permits the functioning of the euro area to be reformed. What do you think?  A window of opportunity is opening. It must be seized. In electing Emmanuel Macron, the people of France have confirmed their attachment to the single currency. This gives the new president a strong mandate but also a responsibility to bring forward proposals to reform the euro area. For the ECB, this is good news.  In the first round, half of the votes went to candidates who were very critical of the euro...   This shows just how much the reform of the euro area is needed! The ECB is mindful of this every day, having to ensure the stability of a single currency with 19 different governments which are often pulling in different directions and labouring to manage and resolve crises. That lack of efficiency takes a toll on economic activity and employment. The euro brought stability during the financial crisis. The ECB’s monetary policy is supporting the economic recovery. The euro area has created around five million jobs since mid-2013. But there is still a major, existential problem of lack of trust in Europe and lack of trust between Europeans, as shown for example by cultural prejudices between the north and the south.  Is this only a problem of trust? Isn’t there also a mechanical problem, a design defect, which makes the euro a cause of divergence, rather than convergence, between Germany and the other countries?  It is not because of the euro that the unemployment rate is currently 4% in Germany and 10% in France. It’s because the economic policy responses before and after the outbreak of the crisis were very different in the two countries. Admittedly, at European level, there has sometimes been a lack of coordination; solidarity instruments need to be improved. But there has also been a lack of commitment to reform in some countries.  Is Germany ready to accept more instruments of “solidarity”: a European budget, Eurobonds, etc.?  There is a German prejudice – that Germany pays for the rest of Europe. This is largely untrue. Germany contributes to the European rescue plans in accordance with its economic weight, as do France and Italy. There are symmetrical prejudices in France; for example, the idea that unemployment in France can be explained by the euro being undervalued for German industry and overvalued for French factories. In fact, if unemployment is higher in France it is because the labour market is performing less well. We must overcome these prejudices, which fuel populism. Everyone needs to do their bit.  This is something that Emmanuel Macron has understood very well. France is expected to make proposals about reforming the euro area. But to be credible, it must itself undertake the reforms necessary to bring the French unemployment rate closer to the best performers within the EU.  "
2017-05-18,Benoît Cœuré,Interview with Reuters,"Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balasz Koranyi and Francesco Canepa, on 17 May 2017, published on 18 May 2017","  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balasz Koranyi and Francesco Canepa, on 17 May 2017, published on 18 May 2017  The data has improved since the last Governing Council meeting. How is this affecting the policy discussion?  When you look back at soft and hard data that we've had over the last weeks and months, it gives a much, much better picture than the one we had, say, one year ago. It's a job-rich recovery and it's much broader both across sectors and across economies. That's all positive. The strength and robustness of the growth rate today in the euro zone shows that our measures have been working. It's fair to say we now see our monetary policy measures fully unfolding. We said it would take time for policy to fully pass through to each and every part of the euro zone economy, in particular across countries. We're seeing this now. What does that imply for future policy? It all depends on how confident we'll be that price pressures will be building up to a point where inflation will be sustainably converging towards two percent, which is our definition of price stability.  The growth picture makes us more confident that this will happen. But we cannot be sure at which pace and it's fair to say that today, given the information that we have, we cannot yet be sure that the upturn in inflation is sustainable and self-sustained, that it will be there without our monetary policy support. This comes when you look at different measures of price pressures. One important measure is wages, which we still see as weak in spite of the material decrease in unemployment across the euro zone.    You said that the situation improved a lot over the past year yet the guidance is exactly the same as it was back then. Which parts of the guidance could change to reflect the improved economic situation?  There are different components in our guidance. Part of the guidance I would call it structural, so it's not meant to be changed. It describes our reaction function, so the way that our monetary policy reacts to data. Just to give you an example, that includes that our monetary policy support is conditional on inflation being on a sustainable path towards 2 percent. That is structural and we're not going to change. When it comes to the choice of instruments -- and that is both the choice of instruments within the toolbox and calibrating the intensity of every one of them, so namely the amount of asset purchases and the level of rates -- that has to be guided by facts because different instruments serve a different purpose. They have a different impact on the economy. There has been much discussion about the sequence. It can be changed but the way we look at it will be about the costs and benefits of the instruments. In particular it will be about the costs and benefits of having the very low and negative deposit facility rate that we have today. And that discussion has to be informed by facts. If you ask me if I see grounds to change the sequence today, for me the answer is no. In particular I currently don't see any evidence that the deposit facility rate at -0.40% would warrant a change in the sequence, and there are known merits to the sequence as it stands today. But that's my assessment based on the current expectations about the economy and it could change. It's not set in stone.  What's an example of a scenario in which you would advocate raising the deposit rate before ending net asset purchases?  I don't want to speculate on decisions that the Governing Council has not yet taken because that's not a discussion that we've had. If you ask me in an abstract way, and that's only my personal view, that could be the case if we had strong evidence that the negative Deposit Facility Rate would impose a cost on the banking industry that would be such that this could become a hindrance to our monetary policy transmission, to the bank lending transmission channel. Again, I don't think this is the case today. Since the negative DFR has been introduced, the positive effects have dominated – the latest Bank Lending Survey has confirmed this. In particular, the effects related to the higher volume of loans and also the de-risking of the flows of new loans that are extended to the economy. That's because the economy is doing better, and that is good for the P&L of banks.   Keeping the door open to further deposit rate cuts was one of the ways in which the ECB was trying to avert the risk of deflation. Now that risk has dissipated, so could this be the right time to rule out further rate cuts?  I don't want to anticipate discussions that we'll have in the Governing Council but it's clear that the deflation risk is now off the table and that is also being acknowledged by financial markets, by money market rates and even at the longer end of the curve. Term premium has increased substantially since September and part of it is related to the deflation risk being now clearly off the table from the market's standpoint.  If you do not remove that reference to lower rates, do you not risk losing credibility?   One important consideration is to keep our forward guidance in line with facts. We don't want to let a gap emerge between our forward guidance and our own expectation based on facts. The credibility of our forward guidance depends on it being adjusted to reflect facts.   Do you think such a gap is starting to open up now?  No, I don't think so. It's an ongoing discussion. In the last meeting, the Governing Council has reassessed its perception of the balance of economic risk. Different Governing Council members were coming from different places and there had been public statements. The Governing Council converged on the unanimous view that risks are still tilted to the downside but they are rebalancing and that's a reflection of the continuous reassessment of risk by the Governing Council.  A view has emerged that when it comes to normalising policy it's better to be slightly late than too early?  I don't see that argument as being very convincing when it comes to communication. The communication of the Governing Council has to remain in line with facts and an evolving reality. There's always the temptation of gradualism in monetary policy. Too much gradualism in monetary policy bears the risk of larger market adjustments when the decision is eventually taken. That's the way I would see it.  What do you mean by gradualism?  It’s the risk that our communication deviates from economic reality, which could cause a more forceful market adjustment down the road. I don't see much merit in this. In particular, because that's sometime the argument, we should certainly not put too much weight on political timelines - elections and the like. We do monetary policy based on facts, not political outcomes.  Some measures of market volatility at multi-year lows: is the market being complacent and how does that affect your judgment? What are the banana skins on the road ahead?  Market complacency is a concern. There is a disconnect. There is still quite a lot of uncertainty about the future course of U.S. economic policy, which is being resolved over time but only gradually as the new administration settles in. There is concern about the consequences of Brexit both for the UK and for the euro area. Political uncertainty in the euro zone is reduced, clearly. Part of it has been taken out by the outcome of the French presidential election and that is good news. But the main source of uncertainty comes from the outside. Given this amount of policy and macroeconomic risk that there is around, there is no room for complacency for market participants so they have to be prepared for possible market adjustments. They cannot work under the assumptions that the current, very benign market environment is going to stay forever.  How would the U.S. policy risk play out?   It's not about the policies themselves, which are decided by the U.S. government and by the Fed and on which the ECB does not comment. It's about market preparedness to cope with possible changes in policy. Also in terms of market functioning. We want to be sure that whenever the constellation of asset prices adjusts based on economic or policy changes, that kind of adjustment can be processed in a smooth way by global financial markets. There are known concerns that are related to the limited balance-sheet capacity of large dealers to cope with large changes in asset prices, with lower market liquidity globally in some market segments. That relates to the changing structure of liquidity provision on capital markets, with less liquidity provided by large broker dealers and more by asset managers, which operate under a different set of regulations. This is discussed in the Financial Stability Board and other places. We have the duty to warn market participants that they have to be ready for that. We're sending the same messages to governments, that they have to be prepared for higher long-term financing costs eventually. They have to plan their fiscal policy accordingly.  Are they actually preparing?  I trust them to do so.  Will the ECB be on the hook eventually if yields go up, governments are not prepared and you guys have to step in again to keep yields in check?  Our role as central bank is always guided by monetary policy considerations. So we will always do whatever is needed to bring euro area inflation back to close to 2 percent, no less but no more.      How do you see the balance of risks for inflation?  When you look at the four criteria that Mario Draghi has set as the metrics against which we assess the sustained adjustment it's clear that some conditions are not yet met. For instance we need to be sufficiently confident that the rise is durable and will not reverse, which is the second criterion. When you look at measures of core inflation there has been an increase in April but the jury is still out as to how much of it is related to seasonal effects and particularly to Easter and so it's too early to conclude that there would be a sizeable upward adjustment in core inflation. The third criterion was that we want to be reassured that the upward path in inflation can be maintained even in conditions in which monetary policy becomes less accommodative. And this also is not there. The future path of inflation remains dependent on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation. So when you look at the four criteria, the conditions are not yet met.  So are the other two ticked?  The first crierion is that the path of inflation is expected to reach levels below but close to 2 percent within the medium term horizon. I would say broadly yes. By and large yes, based on current staff forecasts. But it also depends on what you call the medium term. The fourth criterion is about euro area inflation, and not the inflation of any individual country, which goes without saying. So the question is more about sustainability and not being reliant on our monetary support, and these are criteria 2 and 3. So we're not there yet. We're not yet at a stage where this strong demand for labour would translate into higher nominal wages. But at some point we'll reach that point and then wages will start rising. There are good reasons to think we'll get there. We've been in this initial stage of the recovery, where it has been a lot about part-time jobs and temporary contracts. Of the net employment created since the crisis, around one third has been for workers under temporary contracts and around one quarter part-time. And undoubtedly the objective of these workers is to work more, not to get pay rises. But time will come when full- time and permanent jobs are created, and then wages will rise.  Taking it all together is this a cyclical upswing or a structural recovery?  So far it's entirely cyclical. In my view, the single most important issue for European governments, ministers and leaders is how to make it structural. The recovery so far has been mainly driven by monetary policy and low commodity prices. Our models show that around half of the recovery since the crisis can be attributed to monetary policy. If that remains cyclical we'll be in big trouble because the economy will not generate the level of growth that will be enough to solve the structural issues of Europe.  In particular it would not generate the level of resources that would be enough to sustain the commitments made by European governments, underpinning our social contract. That should be a priority and that's entirely outside monetary policy.   Is the Eurosystem starting to see signs of scarcity of German bonds?  We are on a path which was very carefully calibrated last December. We don’t see a risk of shortage of bonds over the duration of programme, until December 2017 and beyond. There is scarcity but there will be no shortage.   The average maturity of German bonds has gone down considerably since the Bundesbank has been allowed to buy below the deposit rate. What does that tell us?  Buying below the deposit facility rate was an important part of the December decision. We’ve broadened the eligible universe by lifting the deposit rate facility floor and that’s clearly been a key condition for us to keep the program going while respecting the other constraints, particularly the issue and issuer limits, which matter a lot for the Governing Council. The consequence is that Bundesbank and the ECB are buying at a much shorter maturity along the German curve.  What’s the economic benefit of that?  The bund curve is a reference curve in Europe together with the OIS curve. So by controlling both the short and the long end of the yield curve, we are setting financial conditions for the entire euro zone. The bund curve is a key driving force behind all bond price adjustments and all asset price adjustments for the whole of the euro zone.  In your cash collateral facility German banks have taken up their allotment and would even take more. Other are meanwhile not using their full quota. Is this framework still appropriate?  We’ve devoted a lot of time and attention to this issue and it’s being monitored very closely. Whenever this framework needs to be adjusted, it will be adjusted. We stand ready to adjust it, if there was a need. So far the cash facility has worked very well. A lot of the distortions we are seeing in the repo market are driven by forces outside of monetary policy, like regulatory constraints, which are particularly visible at the end of the month and quarters. Also the demand for bunds has been partly driven by flight to quality in the face of high level of political uncertainty. That might be abating now. We can’t do much to alleviate that.   But you don’t see the ECB taking it all upon itself?  The implementation of monetary policy is based on the de-centralisation principle so it will remain that way.  Is there a way to direct more of those 50 billion euros to Germany if they’ve used up their allowance?  We have flexibility to reallocate part of that capacity.   Greece has made clear progress. But any inclusion of Greece in QE depends on a successful debt sustainability review, which in turn requires a decision on easing the Greek debt burden. What do you need to declare Greek debt sustainable?  We’ve made it clear that we first want to see a performing adjustment programme. And this we have. Then we want the concerns over the sustainability of Greek debt relieved. This means we have a clear sequence. The first step was for the Greek government and the four institutions to agree on a new set of policies that allows for the conclusion of the programme review and for the IMF to go to their board. The policies are now being discussed and voted by the Greek Parliament, as we speak. This is a positive step. It’s been a huge effort for the Greek government and it’s done.  The next step is agreeing on measures that address debt sustainability concerns. The framework was set by Eurogroup ministers in May 2016 and it will not change. This will be discussed next Monday in Brussels and I hope they can find an agreement. These measures would be implemented in mid-2018, at the end of the programme, but what we would like to see as ECB is a clear description of the debt measures and how much they would contribute to the sustainability of Greek debt. We need a sufficient degree of specificity.  Once these conditions are met, there can be a successful conclusion of the review by the ESM and there can be a successful discussion in the IMF board. These are all preconditions for us to start a discussion in the Governing Council on QE inclusion. Then the Governing Council will have a discussion on technical measures to be taken. This will include an assessment by the Governing Council on debt sustainability and other risk management conditions.  Monday will be the day for political decisions. I don’t see a discussion starting in the Governing Council on PSPP inclusion before all the steps are taken on the European side and the IMF side, that is, before decisions are taken in the ESM Board of Governors and IMF Executive Board.  Do you need the IMF on board or just need an up or down decision?  We’ll take our decision independently and we don’t formally need the IMF to be on board but it would clearly give us comfort if the IMF was on board in terms of the credibility of the debt measures.   What may be the impact of the French elections economic growth?  There is less uncertainty, which is good in the short term. Is it a game changer for growth in the short term? I’m not sure. The French recovery was already quite robust before the election. But it does change the longer term outlook because it increases the chance of reforms that could turn the cyclical recovery into a structural recovery, first at the level of France and then at the level of the euro area as a whole.

2017-05-11,Peter Praet,Interview with Peter Praet for Trends/Tendances,"Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Daan Killemaes and Jasper Vekeman on 4 May 2017 and published on 11 May 2017","  Interview with Peter Praet for Trends/Tendances   Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Daan Killemaes and Jasper Vekeman on 4 May 2017 and published on 11 May 2017  So let's kick off straight away with the topic of the moment: the risk of deflation has subsided, the economy is recovering, political risk is on the wane… Isn't it time…?   Peter Praet: (interrupts) “Yes, political risks are diminishing, yet policy uncertainties still persist – Brexit, for example. We've seen how negotiations can swing very fast from one side to the other. And as far as the economy is concerned, there's still a wide array of risks. They're moving towards a more balanced configuration, but are still tilted to the downside.  For the first time in many years, we're seeing a synchronised recovery of the world economy. But two key points deserve mentioning here. The first is that the euro area recovery is not yet sustainable without support from our monetary policy. In addition to monetary support of the recovery, structural reforms are necessary for sustainable growth over the medium to long term. The second point is that confidence indicators, the soft data, tend to be stronger than the hard figures. To accurately assess the level of monetary support that is still needed, it's important to have a confirmation of confidence indicators in hard data.”   Given this uncertainty, do you think it's too early to start reducing policy support?   Praet: “Let me start with the good news, and that is that our monetary policy is working. Am I being too triumphalist? That's a matter for discussion, but our policy has undeniably played a key role in avoiding deflation and supporting the economy. And for the first time in many years, growth is now being driven primarily by domestic demand, and in particular private consumption. So the argument that our policy is leading people to hoard their money is unfounded. And the argument that people are actually saving more due to negative real interest rates doesn’t hold either.”   So why the caution about which policy direction to follow?   Praet: “The last time we tightened our policy was 2011. After a long period of accommodative policy such as the one we have today, any change in the policy stance must be prepared carefully and implemented very gradually. And such a change must also be supported by sufficient evidence that growth is translating into a path of sustained adjustment in inflation towards below, but close to 2%.”   So you're not yet seeing a sustained rise in inflation?   Praet: “Inflation has recently been quite volatile. We've always maintained that we should look through short-term volatility. That’s why what counts most now is underlying inflation, for example core inflation (inflation excluding the more volatile elements, such as energy, Ed.). And that's still on the weak side. In recent months we've seen producer prices rising worldwide, and now even in Europe somewhat. In the past, the pass-through from producer prices to consumer prices for non-energy industrial goods, an important component of core inflation, typically took one to two years. We'll have to wait and see how fast it will go this time.  We are also looking at prices in the services sector, which are to a large degree determined by wages. In the past, we have sometimes overestimated wage inflation, as we failed to properly factor in people who gave up on the job market or those forced to accept part-time rather than full-time jobs. But we now have a better picture of underutilisation in the economy, which is greater than the official unemployment figures would have us believe.  Recently, the gap between that broadly defined unemployment and the traditional measure has begun to narrow. That suggests people are returning to the job market. Over the next couple of years the pressure on wages should start to feed into inflation. Things are evolving in the right direction. We're not trapped in a low inflation environment.”   You're happy that inflation is returning?   Praet: “We currently have increased confidence in the path of inflation that we have outlined in our forecasts. But before we can start scaling back our policy, even gradually, we'd like to see further confirmation. We believe that the output gap (the gap between potential production and real production, Ed.) will have closed by 2019, and that price pressure will follow as a result. However, for the time being, economic developments are still dependent on very favourable financing conditions, for which monetary policy plays a very important role. But there are other factors too. Financial conditions also depend on international factors, in particular on potential spillovers from the United States.”  You are waiting for greater clarity, but in the meantime there is growing criticism. The banking sector in particular is grumbling about negative interest rates.    Praet: “That's true, but their criticism is often excessive. The banks don't have it easy and their profits are under pressure, but that's not only due to negative rates. There was too little consolidation post crisis, for instance. So there is now a great deal of competition in the banking sector. However, we observe that this situation does not prevent banks from letting their clients benefit from easy financing conditions, including access to cheap long-term central bank credit (TLTROs). So right now we are satisfied with the impact of our policy. Surveys of SMEs for example show that they're no longer particularly worried about access to credit. And that suggests that lending is no longer holding back growth.”   As long as interest rates are negative, this will fuel criticism. Not least because the concept of ‘negative rates’ is so difficult to grasp. Could that be an argument for hiking rates before scaling back your bond-buying programme?   Praet: “The negative deposit rate is part of a complex package of interrelated measures. If one element changes, this can have an immediate effect on all interest rate levels. Suppose you keep buying bonds, which pushes down long-term rates, while raising short-term rates, which changes the expectations for all future interest rates. You then exert two opposing forces on long-term rates, ultimately partially negating the effect of the bond-buying programme by raising short-term rates. Look, there is a very strong chain of logic behind the decision to first scale back Quantitative Easing (QE, the bond-buying programme, Ed.), raising the term premium included in long-term rates, and only then hiking short-term rates. We have to scale back our policy in an orderly fashion if we don’t want to undo the benefits of what we've been doing for the past few years.”  Why does this sequence cause so much discussion if it's so obvious?   Praet: “Some bankers assert that an increase in the deposit rate would actually constitute a loosening of our policy, as banks would then give more credit. But as I said, lending levels are already developing well. No one likes the current environment. Not even me – I'd love to see higher growth and investment and more structural reforms. But that's just not the way things are right now. We will of course re-analyse the situation in June. It's difficult to pinpoint when to start scaling down our stimulus. We first need assurance that inflation is on a sustainable path. But we need to be patient. The economy is normalising.  But it is a slow process and there are still downside risks.”  What is your message to savers, as they have the feeling that they've already been paying for the crisis for years?   Praet: “I'm a saver too but we should not forget that the crisis has cost many people their jobs. Without our monetary policy, we would have been stuck in a deep economic depression. One also has to consider that low interest rates have made debt servicing easier, in particular on mortgages. In a number of countries like Belgium these gains are larger than the losses on savings accounts.”   That's of little comfort to savers, who are losing purchasing power due to inflation and zero interest rates.    Praet: “That's true for a certain category of savers. And in absolute terms, this group is a large one. I have in mind pensioners who are not especially wealthy but have some savings, and that have been living partly on the income from their savings. Not everyone is in a position to diversify into equities. Low interest rates are also an important issue for pension funds and life insurers, but it doesn’t make a decisive case for pursuing the wrong monetary policy.”   So they're collateral damage, as it were?   Praet: “Well, all monetary policy entails certain redistribution effects. Had the ECB not acted, the distributional effects would have been much worse. We have our mandate and that is price stability. And where there are major redistribution effects, we have governments to even that out. It would be a major mistake to conduct monetary policy based on considerations other than price stability. Then you might as well place the central bank within the Finance Ministry. And I doubt that even they would like that idea. It remains essential to keep monetary policy separate from the government.”   But you might also make a mistake and turn off the money flow too late?   Praet: “I think there is a major difference in the sort of mistake you could make these days. If you react late, you risk some inflationary pressures, as the economy turns out to be stronger than you thought. This risk is deemed to be limited given the degree of slack we are still seeing in the euro area. On the other hand, scaling back too early could jeopardise the recovery and the convergence of inflation towards our objective”   Is that the discussion that ECB President Mario Draghi referred to in his most recent press conference?   Praet: “No, that debate primarily concerned upside and downside risks for growth. Are they balanced or not? The assessment of the balance of risks plays a very important signalling function. The Governing Council signalled that risks are increasingly balanced, but still tilted to the downside. We will of course be re-evaluating the situation in the following meetings.”  We see that Draghi sometimes changes half a sentence, and on other occasions alludes to the lower risks. Is he trying to massage the markets?   Praet: “It's not a matter of massaging the markets, it's more a question of careful communication.”   Do you look forward to the day when your every word is no longer dissected?    Praet: “Well, I'll still have to wait two more years for that, until I retire. A Belgian banker once told me, when I was working with the Generale Bank: ‘I had a great deal to tell, but nothing to say. Now I have a lot to say, but may tell little. Once I retire, I guess I'll have nothing left to say and nothing left to tell’.”  Text box  Bond-buying has increased the central banks' balance sheets dramatically. Will they ever shrink back to pre-crisis levels?  “It's still too early to say. There are many aspects to this issue, which is a matter of discussion in the Federal Reserve. This is also uncharted territory. What if you stop reinvesting in bonds when they reach maturity? What effect would that have on the normalisation of interest rates? Would that process then speed up? It's not a simple matter at all. Everything in monetary policy is interlinked. Every time you change direction, you set a chain of events in motion. Another aspect, which relates more to the functioning of financial markets, is the balance between the supply and demand for safe assets. A general trend has been a decline in the supply of safe assets: corporate bonds with the highest credit scores have almost disappeared; some countries have lost their AAA-rating. On the other hand, demand remains very high. A lot of research is being conducted into this matter. Some researchers are suggesting that central bank balance sheets should remain permanently higher, to use their reserves to reduce the gap between supply and demand.”  "
