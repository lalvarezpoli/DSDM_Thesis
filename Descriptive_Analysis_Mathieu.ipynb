      "Content 1:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 2 February 2024 7 February 2024  Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.   \n",
      "Content 2:   INTERVIEW  Interview with De Volkskrant   Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Jonathan Witteman on 29 January 2024 3 February 2024  In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.   \n",
      "Content 3:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Die Zeit   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Kolja Rudzio 31 January 2024  Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!    \n",
      "Content 4:   CONTRIBUTION  Thanks to Wolfgang Schäuble   Contribution by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, French and German members of parliament and other personalities, published on n-tv.de Frankfurt am Main, 22 January 2024 A Franco-German homage and appeal  As a young member of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble founded the Baden-Alsace discussion group together with the Mayor of Colmar, Joseph Rey. In his last ever campaign appearances, he supported pro-European parliamentary candidates in Alsace and Lorraine. Born during the war, raised in the French occupation zone, elected in the border region of southern Baden, friendship with France was close to his heart throughout his life – as the foundation for a strong Europe.  As a minister, Wolfgang Schäuble worked in close contact with his French counterparts. He was the first German finance minister to participate in a meeting of the French cabinet at the Élysée Palace. He formulated the aspiration to always take French and European interests into account: “If a solution is good for Europe, then it is good for Germany. And if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany”. German unity and European integration, open borders and joint security, a strong euro as a guarantee of stability – these fundamental convictions shaped his actions.  As President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, together with the then President of the French National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, spearheaded the establishment of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on 25 March 2019 in Paris; this joint chamber, comprising 50 German and 50 French members of parliament, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both Presidents had previously signed the Franco-German Parliamentary Accord, which – some 56 years after the Élysée Treaty – adds a parliamentary dimension to the Franco-German friendship as an intergovernmental agreement, thus raising it to a completely new level. None of this would have been possible without Wolfgang Schäuble’s impassioned efforts alongside his colleague in Paris.  Even in his last interview – published on 24 December 2023, just two days before he passed away – Wolfgang Schäuble called for reviving the Weimar Triangle as a “German-Polish-French engine for Europe” and strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities: “Let’s follow this European path. Only by working together can Europe play an economic, military and environmental role in the world.“  That is his legacy. And that is why the state memorial ceremony in his honour is quite rightly taking place on 22 January, “Franco-German Day” – exactly 61 years after the signing of the Élysée Treaty and six years to the day since Wolfgang Schäuble became the first President of the Bundestag to address the French National Assembly on 22 January 2018. In that speech he described the Franco-German friendship as \"a gift from history\", but one owed to the vision of courageous people who, after the world wars and the crimes committed by Germany, showed the way to reconciliation. Wolfgang Schäuble said: “What has been achieved inspires us to move forward” and added “Let us use the freedom we enjoy today. Let us live up to our responsibilities as courageously as the original signatories. Together! ”  Wolfgang Schäuble more than lived up to these responsibilities, and did so honestly and tirelessly. Yet the state memorial ceremony in the German Bundestag with Emmanuel Macron is more than just a tribute to great merit. It is a mission and an appeal. It is a mission entrusted to us, as leaders in politics and society, to bring the European vision to life in a spirit of close partnership. And it is an appeal to young people to keep enthusiastically pursuing the idea of Europe. Peace, freedom and friendship cannot be taken for granted, we have to work for them again and again. As for European integration, it is far from complete and must continue to be shaped, with determination – and by those who are truly European at heart, as was Wolfgang Schäuble.  We will honour Wolfgang Schäuble's memory with immense gratitude for his life's work. We pay tribute to a great German, a great friend of France and a great European. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Wolfgang Schäuble.   \n",
      "Content 5:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini 13 January 2024    The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?  The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.  Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.  The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.   What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?  The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.  Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.   Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?  Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.   The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?  I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.  It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.  Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?  For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.  Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?  The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.   Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?  For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.  Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?   We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.   There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?  Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.  Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?  That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.  EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?   A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.  Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?  We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.  Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?  It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.   \n",
      "Content 6:   INTERVIEW  Q&A on X   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted and published on 10 January 2024 10 January 2024 Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% inflation is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: \"central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s\". Yet, we have seen how inflation has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the \"normal mechanism\" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of \"austrian\" or \"hard-money\" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As inflation falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about inflation reacceleration or does the link between Growth/Inflation (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Inflation has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on inflation in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee inflation reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to inflation as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling inflation raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying inflation are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that inflation is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and inflation. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly disinflationary before the pandemic and inflationary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of inflationary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our inflation target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average inflation after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act inflation after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average inflation?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, inflation will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term inflation and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or inflation.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and inflation is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core inflation above 2% for the entire year. At which level inflation would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that inflation sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the disinflationary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate inflation BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see inflation returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect inflation to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament.

      "Content 7:   INTERVIEW  Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit   Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB  3 January 2024 When I think of Wolfgang Schäuble, the first image I see is him sitting across from me at the table of the French cabinet in the Élysée Palace, the first German finance minister to participate in such a meeting. I see him sitting at the negotiating table in Brussels, at one of our many meetings that ran long into the night. I hear the straight talker who never shied away from difficult decisions. I remember the dedicated public servant, a master of diplomacy with the intellectual ability to understand opposing viewpoints. I see a natural statesman with the courage to stand by his convictions as well as the pragmatism to recognise the world as it is. And I see a man of loyalty and kindness.  The recent passing of my dear friend and colleague saddens me deeply, and my heart goes out to his family. Yet I take comfort in remembering his remarkable achievements for Europe. I recall his own words in this regard because they capture his clear commitment to both Germany and Europe: “If a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.” Few have done as much for Germany and Europe over such a long period as Wolfgang, with his more than half a century of public service. As minister of the interior, he was at the heart of Germany’s reunification process. It was a moment of profound change for the country and for all Europeans, and one that had to be handled with great care in view of the sensitivities of neighbouring countries to German history. Wolfgang understood that one of the best ways for Germany to demonstrate its responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours. That was no small matter in a nation so proud of the Deutsche Mark. But he knew that a single currency would bind Europe together and protect the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations, and that this was in Germany’s and in Europe’s best interests. When Europe’s sovereign debt crisis came, Wolfgang was a calming influence, reminding us that the euro is much more than just a currency. His defence of Europe was unwavering and absolute. Nevertheless, he was always self-reflective, and later asked himself how things could have been done differently, potentially causing less suffering. Wolfgang’s intellectual rigour stemmed from his ability to combine the subtlety of a diplomat with the attention to detail of a lawyer. It was a quality that put him at the forefront of discussions in the 1990s on how to build a more deeply integrated European framework.  His statesmanship would have been welcome in today’s challenging environment of extreme views. His success did not come through a forceful personality, but from understanding how to find common ground with others. This approach has served Germany and Europe well. In my experience, Wolfgang’s philosophy was consistent: stay true to yourself and to your democratic institutions. Now is a timely moment to remember that as we remember him. I will miss my dear friend, and the birthday flowers he sent me over many years!   \n",
      "Content 8:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Meike Schreiber und Markus Zydra on 18 December 2023 22 December 2023    Inflation has recently fallen to 2.4%, more rapidly than expected. Are you satisfied?    We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2%. We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term, as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire, such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services. We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2% by 2025.  So, we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.   But you do want to go the last mile?  We must go the last mile: we have an inflation target of 2%.   Would 2.1% not be enough?  We want to return to 2% on a sustainable basis.   There is war in Ukraine and Gaza. How much do global crises influence the central bank’s work?   Geopolitical shocks lead to uncertainty and thereby affect economic decisions. At the same time, they can also push up energy prices and hit world trade by disrupting supply chains – which we see happening in the Red Sea right now. Geopolitics can also influence the green transition, if the supply of commodities, such as those required for producing solar cells or batteries, is restricted for political ends. All of this affects our core business: the fight against inflation.   Your policy rate decisions are data-dependent, as you always emphasise. How useful are historical data to you when, as at present, the global situation is constantly changing fundamentally?  Historical data are valuable as one can derive patterns from them. But the world can change very quickly. We then need to adjust our analyses, without discarding historical knowledge. The macroeconomic environment has indeed changed radically over the past few years. We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then – owing to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine – quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation. Looking at the period of low interest rates would hardly help. But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.   Inflation was very low in the past decades. Was that mainly because of the central banks’ sound monetary policy? Or was it partly luck, thanks to globalisation for example?   It was both. After the great inflation of the 1970s, monetary policy changed fundamentally. Central banks have become more independent and have a clearer mandate: price stability. This has increased the credibility of monetary policy. But there have also been macroeconomic trends, particularly globalisation and China’s entry into the world market, which played an important role and brought down inflation.  Has the fight for stable prices got tougher?   Since 2020 there have been several severe external shocks. That makes monetary policy more challenging.   Will inflation be higher in future than it was before?   Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2%. At the same time, we may be confronted with more supply-side shocks. And these could turn out to be inflationary, even though that is hard to predict. Climate change, for example, drives prices, we see that already. Extreme weather can push up food prices, low water levels in the Panama Canal increase transportation costs, and carbon taxes raise the price of fossil fuels. A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well. But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence, which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.   When you joined the Executive Board in 2020 you wanted to smooth the fractious relationship between Germans and the ECB. Did you manage to do so?   The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB. It has enabled us to strengthen the ECB’s credibility.   But the ECB was too slow in combating inflation. Many people haven’t forgotten that.     We acted relatively late, but all the more decisively. We sharply increased interest rates within a short time, and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation. Inflation was initially caused by rising energy prices and disrupted supply chains owing to the pandemic and the war. These constrained aggregate supply, while demand remained robust. Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations. We succeeded in doing that. It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2%.   Inflation has fallen, but the higher prices continue to put pressure on people.  The prices are clearly higher than before the pandemic, and monetary policy cannot roll back that increase. And people would not be better off if we plunged the economy into years of deep recession just to bring the prices back to their old levels.  Would you manage, though?  With massive consequences, but this is not the task of monetary policy. An energy price shock makes an economy that is reliant on energy imports poorer overall. Somebody has to bear those losses.  When you have achieved your 2% inflation target, is there a risk of forgetting that the high level of prices is as good as entrenched now?  We target inflation, not the price level. Also in the past, it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.  The quick and sharp interest rate hikes have led to banks suddenly making record profits. Is this fair?  Our decisions are guided by our price stability mandate. But they have side effects, including their impact on bank profits. Banks have lent money at higher rates, but they have not passed the higher interest rates on to their depositors immediately or in full. But we expect banks’ profits to be under more pressure in the future because banks will face higher funding costs and rising credit default risks, while lending is weakening. Banks would therefore be well-advised to use these short-term profits to build up a buffer against future losses.  But banks tend not to do that, opting to pay out dividends instead. Erring on the side of caution would certainly not hurt the banks.  The high profits are also boosted by the 4% deposit facility rate which banks receive on their excess reserves. The ECB could shrink these deposits by raising the minimum reserve requirement. Why has it not done so?  In July we decided to no longer remunerate the minimum reserves while keeping the minimum reserve requirement at 1% of the minimum reserve base, which consists mainly of customer deposits. The minimum reserve requirement is not an effective way of compensating the remuneration of excess liquidity. Large banks have the highest excess liquidity, smaller banks have less. At the same time, the smaller banks are mostly funded by deposits. This is why they would be disproportionally affected by higher minimum reserve requirements.  By the same token, large banks are subsidised with the deposit rate, because many smaller lenders only have low excess amounts that are remunerated.  Banks are not subsidised. But the effects of our measures do vary. For example, during the pandemic the ECB granted longer-term loans that have strongly benefited smaller banks. At the same time, until recently banks were charged a negative interest for their excess liquidity, and that affected large banks more. There are no banks that are systematically at an advantage or a disadvantage. All banks are important for the transmission of monetary policy.  The ECB could sell all the sovereign bonds – that would solve the excess reserve problem. The ECB’s balance sheet has already shrunk significantly. This will continue in the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity. But the primary monetary policy instrument is ECB policy rates. The reduction of our balance sheet is happening gradually in the background, also to avoid market turbulence. While we are not expecting any, we are not taking any risks.  The ECB is making losses now because it has to pay high interest to banks while holding low-yielding bonds. A central bank that is making losses doesn’t look too good.  Our bond purchases were always guided by monetary policy considerations. Take the pandemic emergency purchase programme. This measure probably averted a serious financial crisis that would have wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s lives. The ECB’s losses cannot be viewed out of context.  But they do damage your reputation.  We always assess whether our measures are proportionate, and losses can damage the central bank’s credibility and independence. In the future, this might lead to a certain reassessment of bond purchases.  How do you assess the ECB’s bond purchases?  Bond purchases can be employed for achieving two distinct goals: price stability on the one hand, and market stabilisation on the other. They were very successful in stabilising the financial markets. But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation. At the time, one problem was the very restrictive fiscal policy. Governments failed to make use of the low interest rate period to invest, and this made life difficult for monetary policy.  The lesson here is that fiscal and monetary policy need to pull together.  When you joined the ECB in 2020, inflation was low, the key interest rate below zero and central banks were making profits. This has all changed. How has it affected you?  I have learnt that the world can change much more quickly than you think. The central bank needs to react swiftly in such situations, and this is a challenge. But I think that we have done pretty well in the past four years.   \n",
      "Content 9:   INTERVIEW  Interview with 20 Minutos   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Emilio Ordiz and Jorge Millán 21 December 2023  Wage cost data in Spain point to an increase of 4.7%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that domestic inflation is resisting and is largely predicated by wages. Do you think wage moderation is required to beat inflation?  A year ago inflation was above 10% and now it is below 3%. Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable, i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation, basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade, and because monetary policy is taking effect. However, average wage growth in the euro area is over 5%, whereas productivity is barely improving. This means that unit labour costs are rising, which adds to inflationary pressures. In 2022 profit margins increased considerably, but this year the increase has been more moderate. This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs, which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.   What will the ECB do in this situation?  We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins, as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2% target. We are keeping a very close eye on this.  The EU is emerging from this crisis better than it did in 2008. What do you think has changed?  We have the experience of what happened in 2008 and the two crises are completely different. The 2008 crisis broke out on the back of extremely high private sector debt levels, which had a significant impact on the banking sector. The response was also very different. For the crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic, there have been no limits to fiscal policy, and this has been accompanied by monetary policy that has also been very expansive. In addition to this, the European Union came up with an action plan for all countries throughout the bloc, providing them with funding through the Next Generation EU programme.  However, the situation has now changed. Almost all income indicators have returned to their pre-pandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation. To this end, the ECB takes action through its monetary policy but we also need to see fiscal policy return to normal.   With euro area inflation at 2.4% in November and euro area GDP stagnating for the past twelve months, how do you explain to people why interest rates are being kept so high?   Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do, which is bring inflation down. Monetary policy operates by tightening financing conditions: higher interest rates affect levels of economic activity. And when economic activity is dampened, inflation slows. Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2%, monetary policy might then start to ease. But it’s still too early for that to happen.   When can we expect to see the first interest rate cuts?   If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time, current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2%. We are data dependent. The data have been favourable but still not enough for us to change our monetary policy. It’s therefore too early to talk about a cut in interest rates.  What do you think about opinions from certain quarters that the ECB is sort of following in the slipstream of the US Federal Reserve?  The US economy’s fundamentals and cycles differ from Europe’s. US fiscal policy has been much more expansive, growth is higher and the rate of unemployment, below 4%, is even lower than in the euro area. With an unemployment rate of 6.5%, our labour market is in good shape, but on the whole the economies are in different situations. As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, what the Federal Reserve does is relevant, but it does not determine the ECB’s monetary decisions.  Do you think that now is the time for completing banking union? This debate always seems to be ongoing but never seems to reach a conclusion.  Completing the banking union is essential if we want full economic and monetary union in Europe. There is one pillar missing: a European deposit insurance scheme. European elections will be held in June 2024, offering another opportunity for this. Completing banking union should be on the future European Commission’s agenda, as should making progress on a fiscal union through the introduction of a common fiscal stabilisation function.  Do you think there is the risk of a recession if, for example, the war in Ukraine drags on?   The ECB does not expect a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But beyond whether or not a recession will occur, the main issue is that Europe’s economy has a structural growth problem. Both our projections and those of the European Commission see very moderate growth of around 1% up until 2026. These potential growth levels are low because productivity is barely improving. Europe needs to import more energy than other global economies. As a result, the energy crisis further exacerbates its competitiveness issues. Structural reforms are therefore necessary. The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, but to achieve growth, other factors must be brought into play.  What would these reforms have to be?  One would be completing banking union, as I mentioned. Clear progress also needs to be made towards the capital markets union, and also in the single market of the European Union. Not much is said about the latter, but we are in a situation where there are hardly any limits on state aid, which creates imbalances between countries, depending on their fiscal position. The focus basically needs to be on Europe's low growth potential, how to increase productivity and the reforms needed to boost growth in the medium term.  Do you think it would be feasible to standardise the formula for the European Union’s Next Generation funds?  The Next Generation funds were a response to the pandemic and had two very positive aspects: the issuance of joint debt and the fact that part of the aid consisted of grants rather than loans. Beyond the clearly positive effects of the programme, it ultimately highlights that we need to complete our economic and monetary union. And to do so it is vital to have a permanent centralised fiscal policy instrument, and to implement structural reforms.  Staying with the European Union, there was an agreement on fiscal rules yesterday. How does the ECB see it?   Markets are calm and interest rates on sovereign debt have even fallen. But this can change relatively quickly in the context of low growth, tight monetary policy and geopolitical risks. That is why it is very important to have a clear framework of common fiscal rules. We welcome that there's an agreement because that reduces uncertainty in the markets.  And what is the ECB calling for?  Our recommendation is that the framework should be simple, transparent, easy to understand and countercyclical. In other words, it should allow fiscal policy to be expansionary in bad times and contractionary in good times. Fiscal action plans need to ensure a prudent and sustained reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in structural deficits. They should also create fiscal space for public investment in digitalisation, climate change or defence, and should provide incentives for structural reforms.  In the end, would you say that the EU has completely ditched austerity?  Sometimes it is not clear what is meant by “austerity”. Fiscal sustainability is essential, and, at the same time, fiscal rules have to allow for countercyclical action. And to be able to increase the public deficit during an economic downturn, countries need to rebuild their fiscal positions and reduce their public deficit when the going is good. Beyond fiscal policy, one basic difference between the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis was the very different monetary policy response, providing liquidity to banks and launching a pandemic asset purchase programme that has ultimately provided immense support to the European economy.  Do you think southern European countries have learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis?  Banking systems are much healthier than they were in the period from 2008 to 2011. And that is a key change. Moreover, these countries have made efforts to become more competitive and have a balance of payments surplus. For example, Greece and Portugal have made very significant budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in the risk premia and the ratings agencies. Many southern European countries have made considerable efforts to improve the sustainability of their public finances in the medium term. That is why it makes no sense to now try to create some kind of north-south divide between EU countries.   One of the most important projects the ECB is currently working on is a digital euro. How is it going and what are its key components?  At the moment, we all have euro banknotes in our wallets. A digital euro would be exactly the same, just on our mobiles. It would basically be the banknotes we have now, but in digital form and also backed by the central bank. We want it to be an additional, alternative means of payment. It is not meant to replace banknotes but to complement them. There would also be a limit on the amount of digital euro you can hold. In other words, it would be a means of payment but not a means of saving. We want a digital euro to be more comparable to banknotes than current accounts.  Do you share the Government’s optimism about the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy has a healthy banking system, which is completely different to how the situation was in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the economy is competitive, with a surplus in the balance of payments. It is important that both are maintained in the future. The external sector, including international tourism, has helped a lot in restoring income to pre-pandemic levels.   Are there any challenges?  Education still needs some work. This affects medium- and long-term growth because there are mismatches between labour supply and demand. The 12% unemployment rate means there is room for improvement in the labour market. Like some other euro area countries, Spain has a high public debt-to-GDP ratio of 110%. It is therefore important that these countries implement a prudent adjustment programme to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP.  All countries are going to face major challenges: economic slowdown, geopolitical risks, a new framework of fiscal rules or higher interest rates. That is why economic policy must be predictable.  The last two questions have a Spanish context. What do you think about Nadia Calviño’s appointment as the next president of the European Investment Bank?   Naturally, as a Spaniard, I think it is positive that Spaniards hold key positions in the European Union. I wish her and the institution all the very best.   And in the same vein, particularly seeing as you have held the post that Calviño now leaves, who would you like to see occupy the position left vacant by her?  It is not my place to comment on domestic affairs. I am sure whoever is appointed will be competent and I wish them every success.   \n",
      "Content 10:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2023 5 December 2023  What is your take on the unexpectedly benign November inflation reading? Does the recent string of downside surprises change your view about the inflation trajectory?  “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” I’m sure you know this famous quote that is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly. This was due to the reversal of the previous supply side shocks and was mainly driven by energy and food prices. Base effects played a significant role. The November flash release was a very pleasant surprise. Most importantly, underlying inflation, which has proven more stubborn, is now also falling more quickly than we had expected. This is quite remarkable. All in all, inflation developments have been encouraging. That said, despite these positive developments, I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely. We continue to expect an uptick over the coming months. There’s going to be a reversal of some fiscal measures and of some base effects, and we cannot exclude that there’s going to be a new price spike in energy or food. Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2% target. Our monetary policy is working. The restrictive policy is contributing to dampening growth in aggregate demand. Economic growth has been weak over the past several quarters, and it’s expected to remain weak this quarter before gradually picking up next year. This period of below-potential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2%. So, I believe we are on track, but we need to remain vigilant.  Are we still on the inflation path you outlined in your September projections?  Let’s see what our December staff projections are going to show. But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2% no later than 2025. This is our main objective.  What is your assessment of growth since the September projections?   Some of the hard data we see are not very good. But some of the soft data are giving us hope. The purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) seem to be bottoming out and they’re even showing a small uptick. Of course, this is from very low levels. But it is in line with our projections. Growth is then expected to pick up gradually next year, mainly due to rising real incomes, which should foster confidence and consumption. All this will depend, to a large extent, on the development of the labour market, which has been very resilient. We have seen that firms have held on to their labour force in spite of weakening economic growth. This is only sustainable if they expect growth to pick up. If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market, this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process. But while we do see some softening in the labour market, we do not expect a significant deterioration or a deep and prolonged recession.  Do you see a risk that the rapid drop in credit demand could exacerbate the downturn?  What we’re seeing is that monetary policy transmission is working. There has been a sharp increase in lending rates and a strong slowdown in loan growth. This is exactly what we wanted to see.  Markets are pricing an early spring rate cut but the ECB has guided for steady rates for several quarters. How do you view this discrepancy?  Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year. Central banks are more cautious, and I would argue they have to be more cautious. After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution. If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a sustainable manner. This should happen no later than 2025.  According to our staff projections, the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame. Transmission is working – lending growth is slowing, the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing. We are right on track. But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation. The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum. We now need to see whether this is sustained. We’ve seen very strong wage growth and weak or even falling productivity, leading to a sharp increase in the growth of unit labour costs. This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular, which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained. We’re going to watch upcoming wage agreements very closely. This will certainly also matter for our monetary policy decisions.  If the current level of restriction is sufficient, does that mean you do not see a need for further rate increases?  The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.  What is sufficiently long? Do you also see several quarters of steady rates?  We need to see more data. There’s first likely going to be an uptick in inflation. So, this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now. And most importantly, we need to see what’s going to happen to underlying inflation, to wage growth, to productivity, to unit profits. In order to be confident that we will sustainably return to our target, we need more time.  Am I reading it correctly that you’re not ruling out a rate cut before mid-year then?  We remain data dependent. That’s the main thing. We have to see what’s going to happen. We have been surprised many times in both directions. So, we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months’ time.   What is your view on the timeframe for ending pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments?  As President Lagarde mentioned, the Governing Council is going to discuss reinvestments under the PEPP in the not-too-distant future and I’ll leave it up to you to interpret what that means. It’s clear that discussion is going to come. It’s also clear that at some point we’re going to fully end PEPP reinvestments. The amounts involved are relatively small and markets are expecting this to happen, so I think it’s not such a big deal.  Am I correctly reading the mood that even if reinvestments end, there is no appetite for outright sales of bonds in either the asset purchase programme (APP) or PEPP portfolios?  We have never discussed outright sales.  You gave a speech in March in which you made the case for a demand-driven system for the ECB’s new operational framework. How has you thinking evolved since?  What I said in that speech is that a demand-driven system is well-suited for a heterogeneous currency union that may be prone to fragmentation. Such a system also likely limits the size of the central bank balance sheet. Of course, it can be designed in many different ways. What we are doing in our framework review is trying to find a system that implements our monetary policy effectively and efficiently in a way that minimises the negative side effects. So, the new system has to take into account the specificities of the euro area financial system. It has to be firmly embedded in our legal framework and it should limit our market footprint. But one should be aware that we are starting from a situation of abundant excess liquidity. So whatever framework we choose, money market rates will initially remain close to the floor.  What is the timeline for the balance sheet to shrink to its optimal size?   That depends on various factors that we can’t project perfectly. It also depends on the framework that we will eventually choose. One of the main drivers of the size of the central bank balance sheet is the growth of what we call autonomous factors – banknotes and official sector deposits – and the growth of reserve requirements. These factors already imply that the balance sheet is going to be around three times as large as before the global financial crisis.  In addition, banks could have a higher demand for excess liquidity for regulatory or precautionary reasons. If the outcome of the review was a demand-driven system, the size of the balance sheet would thus also depend on banks’ demand for excess liquidity. This would mean the size would not be determined by us, which is a good thing, because we don’t know precisely what the demand is.  The Federal Reserve has gone with the floor system. Could two of the world’s biggest central banks operate with different frameworks?  I do not see any problem with that. If you look around the world, you see many different frameworks.  The Fed has a supply-driven floor, the Bank of England a demand-driven floor, and Sveriges Riksbank a narrow corridor, while many central banks in emerging markets have a classical corridor. So, there is a wide variety of models out there that are tailor-made for specific financial systems.    Do you see the need for a structural portfolio of bonds and/or longer-term bank loans? What would the size of such a portfolio need to be?    I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of the framework review. There are different ways to provide liquidity to the financial system and all of them are going to be discussed in the review. We are going to weigh up the benefits and costs of each of them, and it could make sense to have a mix of different tools. We need to keep in mind, though, that this only matters far out in the future, because we are starting from a situation where we have a huge monetary policy bond portfolio. The structure of the balance sheet only becomes relevant when it has to grow again. As regards a structural portfolio, I mentioned in my March speech that this could be considered. Also keep in mind that we de facto already have a structural portfolio because some national central banks are holding bonds in their Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) portfolios.  What do you mean by “far out in the future”? Could it be next decade?  That depends on the decisions we are going to take. If we decided on both longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio, we would have to think about a potential split. But this really depends on many factors and I do not want to make any predictions. What is clear is that the balance sheet has to be much larger than it was before the global financial crisis. But, for all the frameworks under consideration, the balance sheet is going to be much smaller than it is now.  Should the ECB introduce new longer-term refinancing operations?  We will discuss the different options available to provide liquidity to the banks, including longer-term operations. But such a facility would have to be different from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) we were offering during the pandemic, in that it would have to be offered at market rates. From the banks’ perspective, longer-term lending operations are attractive because they provide a certain reliability of funding. And they reach all parts of the banking sector directly. That is very different from asset purchases – when you inject liquidity, it typically ends up with the larger banks and in certain financial centres.  Do you see a case for increasing the minimum reserve requirements, as some of your colleagues advocate?  We had a discussion on minimum reserve requirements in July and we discussed both the calibration and the remuneration. We decided to keep the minimum reserve requirements at 1% but to remunerate them at zero, instead of at the deposit facility rate. The reason for this was proportionality. With this change, we can implement our monetary policy stance in the same way and equally effectively while paying lower interest to the banks. That was the justification for reducing the remuneration. The proportionality argument implies that, if we have two options and one of them leads to losses while the other is just as effective in achieving price stability but reduces these losses, then we should choose the option that generates smaller losses. But let me stress that the minimum reserve requirements are not a tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. They also have distributional effects – they have the greatest impact on the banks with the highest deposit base, which tend to be the smaller banks. We are going to discuss the role of minimum reserve requirements in the operational framework review. And until then, we will not take any decisions.  To what extent should profit and loss considerations matter for monetary policy decisions?  Our monetary policy decisions are determined by our mandate. Profit and loss considerations matter only insofar as they affect our credibility and, consequently, our ability to pursue our mandate.  Andrea Enria argued recently that shadow banks need closer scrutiny, and the ECB could theoretically conduct this supervision. If the ECB supervised them, it could also provide them with access to liquidity facilities. Is that needed?  The experience of the pandemic shows that we are able to distribute liquidity across the financial sector without giving non-banks direct access to our balance sheet. At the moment we are not considering opening up our balance sheet to non-banks because there is no clear case for that.   \n",
      "Content 11:   INTERVIEW  Interview with De Standaard and La Libre Belgique   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Ruben Mooijman and Ariane van Caloen, on 23 November 2023 29 November 2023  Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.   What would you say to those who think that banks are making excessive profits?   The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, which has just been published, indeed shows that bank profitability has risen sharply. This improvement can be attributed to the widening of interest rate margins. The return on equity of euro area banks now stands at around 10%, whereas in 2019, barely five years ago, it stood at 4%. So it has clearly improved.  Still, this is something of an illusion − it is after all a short-term improvement. In the long term, we expect profitability to fall again. Why? There are several factors. First, the economy is slowing, which will lead to higher default rates and a decline in asset quality. Second, banks will have to pay more to attract deposits. On term accounts, for example, interest rates have already risen sharply. Likewise, the bonds that banks issue themselves will need to carry a higher return. So overall the cost of bank funding is on the rise. And finally, an often-overlooked factor is that demand for credit is falling. Putting all that together, you can see that high bank profitability is not sustainable. In fact, the financial markets are already convinced of this, as bank share valuations are in no way reflecting expectations of high profits.  Are the banks sufficiently covered for interest rate risks. If not, could the regulator, the ECB, review its requirements?   The interest rate risk of European banks can’t be compared to that run by some US banks such as Silicon Valley Bank with a different business model. The repricing of loans, in other words, raising interest rates in line with the market rate, has been much faster than the repricing of deposits in Europe. However, the interest rates on deposits will also increase at some point.  So is interest rate risk adequately covered?  Yes, but at the same time banks will be facing a loss of profitability as I said. I am talking about the average for the sector.   There has been a lot of debate about interest rates on savings. Politicians are taking initiatives to get banks to raise interest rates. Is that a good idea?  If the ECB raises interest rates, it is for borrowers and savers. Lending rates have risen and the remuneration of deposits is expected to follow suit. The remuneration on savings accounts should reflect our interest rates. That is part of our monetary policy transmission. Because if savings become more attractive, consumers will spend less, reducing demand. This is what we aim for to push down inflation. However, we now see banks are delaying passing on higher interest rates to savers. They can do that because they still benefit from abundant liquidity right now. But we are also taking measures to reduce excess liquidity, so that higher interest rates on savings accounts will become a reality – sooner or later.  Do you see differences between member states in this respect?  Yes, there are differences. In some countries, banks are quick to adjust interest rates on deposits, and in others, such as Spain, they are lagging behind. Euro area banking sectors also differ in the way mortgage loans are granted, whether it is at variable or fixed rates. Strengthening of profitability was particularly notable for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates and the pass-through of higher policy rates to deposits has been slower.  And Belgium?  I know the Spanish situation because it’s my own country, but we look at euro area averages and developments as a whole.  Some economists criticise the system that allows banks to make money easily by depositing their excess liquidity with the ECB. This is resulting in generous profits at the moment because interest rates are rising. What’s your take on this?  The ECB has raised its interest rates with a view to these increases being passed on to all remuneration categories in bank balance sheets. The level of liquidity in the market was extremely high and had to be reduced. This reduction is under way now and will go hand-in-hand with a decline in these types of revenues for banks.  You have also changed the remuneration of the minimum reserve requirement for banks. Some bankers believe that this should be raised to ensure a stronger capital base. Do you think that’s a good idea?  We have indeed set the remuneration of banks’ minimum reserves to 0%. The levels of those reserves have so far not been changed or discussed. I know some central bank governors are in favour of increasing them. We have limited the remuneration on the minimum reserve requirement, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of banks’ liabilities. I understand that remuneration of reserves is important for some banks, but monetary policy shouldn’t be driven by the financial position of banks or the profits of the central banks. Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.  National central banks are going to have to report significant losses owing to the policy of quantitative easing, which led to huge purchases of sovereign bonds to inject liquidity into the market. Do these losses pose a problem?  It’s true that central banks are currently reporting losses owing to the hike in interest rates, but if we look at a longer period of time, for instance over the last 10 years, the net outcome is positive in terms of central bank profits.  What about the real estate market? People are complaining about the higher cost of loans. What would you say to them?   What is happening is part of our monetary policy. The sharp rise in interest rates is starting to dampen real estate prices. This is more apparent in some countries than others, but a moderation in price trends can be seen everywhere. On average, house prices are stabilising. The decline in commercial property prices is much more pronounced.   Does the situation pose a danger?   It could affect banks, but fortunately they are less exposed to commercial real estate than they are to residential real estate. Commercial real estate is more often financed through other channels, such as mutual funds. But in the financial system there is a high degree of interconnectedness, so we look at the overall picture.  Huge investments are needed to make homes and other buildings climate-proof. Are the higher interest rates delaying funding for investments aimed at combating climate change? Could that slow down the climate transition?  It’s true that substantial investments are needed, but I think they should mainly be financed through subsidies and European funds like the Next Generation EU. This is a matter for fiscal policy. That doesn’t alter the fact that the ECB conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing rates without discriminating between sectors or borrowers.   Monetary policy also affects the climate transition in other ways. Some investments are being jeopardised by higher financing costs. This has already resulted in plans for various wind farms being scrapped.  The ECB pays close attention to climate policy, but for us it’s a secondary objective. It’s national governments that play the leading role in climate policy, through taxes and subsidies. We can contribute though – and we do. For example, we prioritise climate-friendly companies in our corporate bond portfolio. This is a small contribution, but it sends a clear signal in the fight against climate change.  The ECB is preparing to introduce a digital euro. Why is that necessary?  We currently have a physical euro in our wallets, whereas the world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. There is a very natural evolution taking place from a physical to a digital euro backed by the central bank. We see the digital euro as a means of payment. We would be able to use this form of public money to pay for our shopping, our bill in a restaurant or all sorts of purchases. Like banknotes, the digital euro will not have to be remunerated. There will be a limit on the amount of digital euro people can hold, to avoid endangering the stability of the banking system. This means that the digital euro won’t compete with current accounts. That is a very clear message we want to send to the banking sector. The digital euro will not be an investment product but a simple means of payment to complement banknotes.  Won’t implementing the digital euro be very expensive for the ECB?  This will be part of our calculations during the preparation phase over the next two years, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted but, in my view, the benefits will outweigh the costs. It will offer another alternative means of payment to those living in the euro area. It will also enable us to take another step towards European strategic autonomy. And at the end of the preparation phase the decision will be taken by the European Commission, the European Council of the European Union and European Parliament.  A number of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, are struggling with how inflation is measured. The way it’s measured means actual inflation is sometimes overestimated and sometimes underestimated. Isn't that a problem for the ECB, as it’s tasked with fighting inflation?  Indeed, changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated. But that's a matter for Eurostat, not the ECB, and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward. Statistical changes to the compilation of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) occur from time to time. A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not. As you know, that was one of the conclusions of our monetary policy strategic review. We work and share information with Eurostat on that topic, with a view to enhancing the HICP. But not on the measurement of energy prices, which is a statistical choice to how the country’s price index is compiled.  Europe is planning to use the profits from frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear to help rebuild Ukraine. The ECB is critical of this. Can you explain why?  Let me first clarify that the ECB is in favour of helping and supporting Ukraine in any way possible. But our position on utilising the dividends and interest from the frozen assets is clear. First: this should be a global decision, ideally involving all members of the G7. In addition, we have to be careful because this could lead to reputational damage. We have to look beyond this conflict in isolation, and there could be implications for the euro as a safe currency. The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation. I think there are other ways to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In Belgium, the launch of the ethical bank NewB has proved very difficult. Are barriers to setting up new banks in the eurozone too high?  Without entering into the details of any particular case, there are different procedures to be followed and criteria to be met, but there are no limitations beyond the legal and capital requirements imposed for the creation of a new retail bank.  But there haven’t been very many new banks in the last few years...  Because there are a lot of banks in the euro area! The real question to ask is about banks’ traditional business model. New sources of revenue need to be found, the number of branches has to be reduced. I suppose that investors are turning away from banks because the level of profitability doesn’t meet their expectations. I think there needs to be further cross-border consolidation.  So are there too many banks?  Given the cost structure of European banks, consolidation could help provide a solution. Above all else, I think cross-border consolidation in the euro area under a single supervisor and within the framework of a single monetary policy would be positive.   \n",
      "Content 12:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Finance   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Albina Kenda 9 November 2023  The ECB did not change its key interest rates at its October meeting, interrupting the series of ten consecutive interest rate increases that had brought rates up by 4.5 percentage points since July 2022. A few days later Eurostat announced that euro area headline inflation had fallen to 2.9% in October. Does this mean that interest rate hikes are over?  It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level, and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2% level we define as price stability.  The evolution of inflation has been positive overall: it was above 10% only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9%. At the same time, core inflation has also been moderating. But we have to be prudent and cautious, as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months. We will continue taking a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions.   Euro area GDP was down by 0.1% in the third quarter, and economists think inflation may rise again over the coming months as the positive base effect will progressively fade out. At the same time, there is a risk of another commodity price shock arising from the situation in the Middle East. If the ECB finds itself at a crossroads, will it prioritise growth or inflation?  Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2%. Unlike some other central banks, the ECB does not have a dual mandate.  At the same time, we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation. We expect that growth will stagnate in the second half of the year and that the fourth quarter will not differ much from the third. Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth; some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.  Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025, with some fluctuations caused by base effects. However, we believe that, if interest rates are maintained at their current levels, inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.   The ECB will publish new forecasts in December. Will these be more or less the same as in September, or are you expecting upward revisions for inflation and downward revisions for growth?   It might be premature to say it, but leading indicators point to the growth outlook being somewhat more negative than we previously projected. As regards inflation, the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.  You mentioned the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to decision-making. But in October the ECB said it considers its key interest rates to be at levels that will make a substantial contribution to lowering inflation, provided they are maintained at those levels for a sufficiently long duration. What is meant by “sufficiently long”?  This means a period of time that takes into account the potential lags of monetary policy. Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive, and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down, as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was. I would not define “sufficiently long” as used in our monetary policy statement as a concrete period of time. We will need to determine this on the basis of data. In our decision-making we will also have to take into account the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical risks related to the conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine.  But what kind of data would the ECB need to see to start reducing interest rates rather than simply keeping them at restrictive levels?  We are not there yet. We will see how things evolve month by month, but our approach now is to keep interest rates at this level long enough to reach our target. Any discussion about lowering interest rates is clearly premature.  To what extent did the ECB’s monetary policy take into account not just the euro area average but the situation in individual Member States, as there are significant differences among them, also in their level of inflation. According to Eurostat, in October Slovakia recorded the highest inflation rate of 7.8%, Slovenia registered 6.6%, while the Netherlands and Belgium recorded deflation of 1% and 1.7% respectively.  We have seen disparities among euro area countries in their economic and financial structures, in the weight of services in their economies and not least in their proximity to the conflict in Ukraine.      There are always differences in inflation and growth, but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries. Our measure of price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.  In dealing with the disparities, it is important to consider the effects of fiscal policies. With regard to base effects, we have to look at how governments have introduced, and have started to withdraw, support measures to mitigate the shocks of the energy crisis. Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries. But our monetary policy is single.  The ECB is now looking more closely, in line with other central banks, at core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. What are ECB’s main concerns in this regard? ECB President Christine Lagarde said this summer that profit margins contributed almost two-thirds to domestic inflation last year. Almost nobody mentions this anymore, but there is now a discussion about the effects of wage increases.   It is essential to focus on core inflation, for which there are several risks. First, there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation. Second, there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate, which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation. And finally, there are unit labour costs. Rising labour costs result from two factors. The first one is wage developments, with wage growth in the euro area now at just over 5%. The second is productivity, which is very low and has been declining because employment growth has been outpacing output growth.  It is true that profit margins grew even faster than unit labour costs last year. This year, however, we are seeing a moderation in profit margins, while labour costs are on the rise.  Our expectation is that part of the increase in labour costs will be absorbed via profit margins, meaning that not all of this increase will be passed through to final prices.   At the ECB, you are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to deepen your understanding of inflation. What will you do differently from what you have been doing so far and what do you hope to achieve? We know that, while not the only one, you have been wrong as far as the inflation forecast is concerned.   Our colleagues working with statistics deal with a lot of information, a lot of data on the financial system and the real economy, so any instrument that helps us manage this monumental amount of information is very useful.  So we are continually looking for algorithms that can give us a better understanding of what is happening in the economy, in the financial system, and a way of factoring in all the underlying tendencies that are embedded in the data we analyse.   There have been warnings that in its fight against inflation the ECB has been focusing only on the demand side of the economy, while supply-side factors also contribute to inflation. Is a more balanced approach warranted for the future, bearing in mind the pressures that may stem from geopolitical tensions, the demographic picture and the implications of the Green Deal? The economy has already been disrupted, is monetary policy next?  Sometimes it is important to stress that monetary policy works through interest rate increases, through the transmission of monetary policy decisions to financing conditions and then through the impact of financing conditions on aggregate demand.  So, monetary policy and the transmission of its decisions aim to influence aggregate demand, consumption and investment. Monetary policy cannot deal with supply-side issues. These need to be addressed through structural policies and fiscal policies.  Let me add that it’s not only the origin of inflation that’s important, but also the possibility of second-round effects, which can make the situation much more complicated, with a possible price-wage-profit spiral. In particular, we need to avoid de-anchoring inflation expectations, as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.  It was announced a while ago that the ECB, in cooperation with Eurostat, would include housing costs in the calculation of inflation. How far along is this project?  This was part of the ECB’s strategy review, and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation. However, such costs need to be well calibrated in the index, and this is mainly Eurostat’s responsibility. Including the cost of owner-occupied housing in the measurement – known as the owner-occupied property cost – contributes to the calibration of inflation. We are very willing to cooperate with Eurostat and provide our input and insights.   So there is no deadline?  It is not up to us. But there is a need for harmonised action at EU level, not just in the euro area, and this takes time.   The ECB has dealt with record-high euro area inflation by raising interest rates at a record pace. In the banking systems of several countries, including Slovenia, borrowers have felt the effects of this policy much more than savers. Is this also due to the consolidation of the banking market and the subsequent lack of competition?   You are right about the effects. As you know, we have made it crystal clear: whenever we raise our key interest rates, this increase should be passed on to all sides of the market.  The current situation can be explained by several factors. First, there is excess liquidity, so banks haven’t been under pressure to raise the remuneration of deposits. However, liquidity conditions are becoming less and less comfortable for European banks – there have been changes to the parameters for long-term liquidity lending to banks under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and changes to our bond-buying programmes, so the decline in liquidity will continue. Second, banks are always slower to change their pricing policy for deposits than they are for loans.  But there is a slow-but-steady increase in the remuneration of deposits, particularly time deposits. We believe that this process will continue. We are monitoring it very closely and, I’ll say it again, when we raise interest rates, we are not only raising them for borrowers, but for savers too, because otherwise the transmission of monetary policy would be incomplete.   Given that deposit interest rates lagging behind lending rates has resulted in considerable growth in banks’ net interest income, could you say that banks are pursuing short-term goals instead of long-term sustainable business goals, especially as you said yourself that the ECB is now determined to reduce excess liquidity in the system?  You’re right – the profitability of European banks has improved recently owing to the increase in key interest rates and an improvement in profit margins.  However, this has not been reflected in the market valuation of banks because markets believe that this improvement in profitability may not be sustainable over time. First, because the economy is slowing, which could lead to an increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Second, because the drop in demand for loans would reduce banks’ revenues. And third, because the cost of funding for banks is rising.  So I think that it’s quite obvious that, despite the improved profitability of banks, there are doubts about how sustainable this will be in the longer term.   What are the challenges to financial stability in the euro area now that we are in a phase of economic slowdown? What is the situation regarding insolvency proceedings, non-performing loans and risks to the banking system stemming from the real estate market? In Germany, residential property prices fell by around 10% in the second quarter. Do you expect a correction elsewhere as a consequence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening?  When interest rates go up, the financial stability situation changes. The first factor we have to look at is valuations of financial assets and real estate assets. One of the main risks we see in terms of financial stability in the euro area is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment of asset prices and the implications it could have for banks. It should be stressed that banks are in a good position in terms of profitability, capital and liquidity. But we cannot be complacent because, as I said, there are some doubts about how sustainable this improvement is going to be over time.  There is another factor for financial stability. We look very carefully at non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly real estate mutual funds. In this regard, we have seen a significant drop in commercial real estate valuations. This decline had set in before the start of the monetary policy tightening but has now accelerated following the rise in interest rates. A number of non-bank financial intermediaries have seen very steep declines, particularly in commercial real estate.  In addition to economic cooling, we are also witnessing a housing crisis across the EU. How do you respond to the criticism that the ECB’s monetary policy has contributed to this, first with bond purchases that lowered bond yields, which led institutional investors to turn to the property market for returns, and now by increasing borrowing costs, which has caused many building projects to be postponed or completely abandoned?  We can be criticised for being too lenient or for being too tough. But, if I may say, I don’t think it’s fair to be criticised for both things at the same time. There were reasons why we had a very expansionary monetary policy – think back to the pandemic and the decline in GDP. I think that without our monetary policy, the situation would have been much worse. Going back even further, to the era of quantitative easing, you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis. However, sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge, and we had to respond.  Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability. Sometimes there are lateral effects. But there are also other policies to deal with a potential real estate bubble, such as fiscal and macroprudential policies.   In other words, you are looking at developments in the real estate market through the prism of the financial stability of the banking system.  For sure. My point is that monetary policy has to be focused on price stability. However, there are other instruments available, like fiscal and other policies. In the event of real estate market growth that is not fully aligned with fundamentals, macroprudential policies can be applied, bank capital buffers can be increased and borrower-based measures can be used to limit excessive growth in real estate lending. A range of policies are available.   What are the latest trends in the credit situation in the euro area?  The evolution is quite clear: financing conditions have tightened as a result of our monetary policy decisions, resulting in a decline in credit demand, which can be seen for both households and firms. This is how monetary policy works.   My last question is on the tax issue. Banks are reporting high profits, largely due to higher net interest income. As a result, several governments have decided to levy additional taxes on them. Why is the ECB not in favour?  Our decision is based on two pillars. The first is that this kind of tax should not impair lending or the transmission of monetary policy measures to the system. The second is that such a tax should not damage the solvency of banks, as this could have medium-term consequences for banks that are not well capitalised.  We have already issued opinions for Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and now Slovenia. The taxes are not all the same, but each opinion points out that the tax should not impair lending and should not damage the solvency of banks.      \n",
      "Content 13:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Kathimerini   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Alexis Papahelas on 30 October 4 November 2023  When you were in Athens last week, you talked about Greece’s resilience and its phenomenal recovery capacity. Could you tell me how this happened? How did Greece become a success story?  When I look at the key performance indicators for assessing Greece’s economic and financial situation, I see improvements across the board: in employment, growth, the fiscal situation and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Greece has completed many of the reforms on its to-do list. Not all of them, of course. There is still more work to be done. I understand that there are more reforms in the pipeline but, overall, the results of the country’s efforts are impressive. And this did not go unnoticed by those whose job it is to rate an economy and assess its credit rating – as shown by the two recent decisions that raised Greece’s rating to investment grade. I think it’s a tremendous testament to the country’s efforts. The turnaround was thanks to the fiscal adjustments and the reforms that were implemented, but also to the resolute efforts of the Greek people and the Greek authorities.  Is the high debt-to-GDP ratio of any concern to you?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is around 160% at the moment. It has fallen significantly in the last couple of years. And obviously this downward trend needs to continue in the future. I know there is more to come, but Greece has evidently responded to this challenge with determination, and the results are already clear to see.  Did you ever get really worried about Grexit? Did you think that it was possible?  There were two particular moments where the threat could have materialised. The first was during the French G20 presidency in November 2011, when there was talk of a possible referendum, which didn’t happen in the end. The second, when the threat was much more tangible and much more worrying, was in July 2015. So, we had two Grexit threats, but the one in 2015 was the most concrete, and if it hadn’t been for the determination of a few European leaders, it would have happened.  You had a front-row seat to the Greek financial crisis from a very early stage. When you look back, do you think that any mistakes were made?  The original mistake was for the country to have found itself in that situation. If there had been greater fiscal discipline and if the prudent principle of establishing a rainy-day fund for bad times when the economy was doing well had been applied, the crisis might not have happened. The fiscal policies in place before and after the crisis hit in 2009 were the original mistakes. As I have said before, it would have been helpful for the IMF to have had longer programmes than those available in its arsenal. The programmes it had were intended for rapid and deep changes, reforms and fiscal consolidation. At the time they weren’t necessarily the best tools for a country that was in a monetary union without a fiscal union or for Greece’s specific fiscal situation.  Did you learn any lessons or draw any conclusions of your own from the crisis?  One very pertinent lesson is to make sure that we have the collective discipline to address the lack of a fiscal union. I think this should be a very pressing concern for all of us. When you have a monetary union without a fiscal union, as we do, you need clear fiscal guardrails and a fiscal framework within which countries can design and implement their fiscal policies and be accountable to the other members of the monetary union. Something else that stands out from the Greek situation is that decisions were made but then sometimes reversed by the subsequent political team. And, even when decisions were taken, the implementation and monitoring needed to move forward didn’t always happen. Another lesson is that, even when banks are not the cause of a crisis, a solid and robust financial sector with well-capitalised banks is crucial.  Are you satisfied with the current state of the Greek banking system?  I think a lot of work has been done to consolidate and strengthen the Greek banking sector. Take non-performing loans, for example. In 2016 almost 50% of loans were non-performing. Now it is just over 8%. That is a significant sign of improvement, which has involved parking those non-performing loans outside the banks. So, in a way, the banking system has been sanitised. Capital ratios are much stronger, non-performing loans have gone down and liquidity ratios are also quite solid. So yes, a lot has been done to make Greek banks more robust and more attractive.  I think the fact that a large foreign bank is taking an interest in a Greek bank is a clear indication that the sector has become more attractive.  Do you think 10 or 12 years ago it would have been possible for you and the Governor of the Bank of Greece Yannis Stournaras to take a walk around Syntagma Square where all the demonstrations were happening? What was going through your mind when you actually did it this time?  I was totally bemused by the transformation, I have to tell you. As you know, I did not come to Greece at the height of the crisis, but I was obviously in frequent contact with the team. I was following the IMF mission’s visits very closely – special security measures were taken and it was a source of anxiety and concern. Now, to walk down the street, say hello to people and feel their energy, vitality and optimism was quite striking. It is a testament to the effort and the determination of the Greeks to turn things around and to take hold of their destiny with the discipline and seriousness required in a union like the EU. I think it’s fantastic that Greece can set standards and be an example of what to do, of what reforms to implement.  Do you have the sense that economic events are driven by geopolitics these days? How hard is it to carry out fiscal and, more importantly, monetary policy?  You and I have been around for a little while. And I think that geopolitics taking precedence over many other developments is nothing new. What I think is slightly different now is that there is a compounded effect of multiple geopolitical developments taking place in various corners of the world. Sometimes they are a reflection of a major schism happening in front of us. When the world had a bipolar power structure, when it was fairly organised and settled, you could anticipate things. You could have more certainty about future developments. Now it’s far more fragmented. Crises are taking place in various parts of the globe at the same time, and it’s not clear who is on whose side and what the next development will be, let alone the final outcome of the current crisis in the Middle East. And if you add to that the crisis that we have just gone through with the pandemic, plus the terribly serious challenge of climate change, which is a tragedy that is already unfolding, that’s a lot of geopolitical and climate-related developments taking place together. That’s what’s making it even harder at the moment, which is why I think that we are confronted with shifts and breaks that, although not unimaginable, certainly fly in the face of the traditional way of thinking or the certainties that we used to have.  Do you think that inflation will recede next year?  This is certainly our forecast and this is certainly our goal. We are determined to bring inflation down to 2%. According to our projections we will get there in 2025.  It seems as though increases in food prices and housing are almost becoming structural now. Are you worried about the political implications of all this, about the political pressures stemming from the rise in the cost of living?  When we measure inflation, we pay attention to the headline rate, which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing – how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car, food on the table, or to have clothes, shelter and everything else. But we also try to understand what is underneath the most variable components. One of those components is food. Is the price of food going to be higher in the future? That’s a possibility if you look at the impact of climate change, for example. Droughts, floods, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will most likely have an impact on food prices going forward .  As for the political implications that you asked me about, let me say that our mandate is to ensure price stability, and this is the best contribution we can make to social peace and to society, to the most vulnerable of its members in particular.  The last question I’d like to ask you is what really keeps you up at night?  I try to sleep as much as I can, and at the moment it’s not a lot, I have to say. When I go to bed, I’m really tired and I fall asleep. But what preoccupies me before I go to bed is the level of violence, hatred and hubris around, which is first and foremost terrible for people – terrible for children and terrible for civilians. And of course, in addition to the human suffering, all this will have an impact on our economies, on the level of people’s confidence, and it will probably make our job a little bit harder going forward.   \n",
      "Content 14:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad   Interview with Philip R. Lane, member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marcel de Boer, Marijn Jongsma and Joost van Kuppeveld on 11 October 2023 16 October 2023  Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.  First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.  What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?  This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.  Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?  What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.  Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.  We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.  QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?  We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate. This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.  Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?   Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.  So no lowering of interest rates until spring?  We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.  And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?  Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.   As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?  I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty. And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.  Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?  I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.    \n",
      "Content 15:   INTERVIEW  Interview with La Tribune Dimanche   Interview with Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, conducted by Marie-Pierre Gröndahl on 2 October 2023 8 October 2023  The ECB raised its key interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in fourteen months, bringing the rate on the deposit facility to 4%, its highest level since the launch of the euro. Coming at a time when people are concerned about the level of interest rates, was this move justified?   We first need to put the action taken by the European Central Bank into context. For several years now the world has been facing a “permacrisis”, a constant succession of serious and unprecedented crises − in terms of their scale, their impact and the speed at which they emerged. The health crisis was followed by Russia’s unjustified war in Ukraine, and then by an acceleration in inflation. All this against the backdrop of the energy crisis, with a number of EU countries experiencing difficulties in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, including real estate.  The ECB’s mandate, unchanged for 25 years, is price stability. It’s our compass. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.     Do you have the tools you need to fight inflation?   Our models were not perfectly suited to the nature of these crises, which resulted, among other things, in the complete shutdown of part of the economy during the health crisis, leading to a greater role for governments, which suddenly became protective. They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades, or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation. The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections. We have worked on these issues, and we are continuing to do so, in order to make the projections more robust.   Have the past projection errors dented trust in the ECB’s actions?    Close to 80% of euro area citizens believe in and support the euro. And 45% trust the ECB, slightly more than did so before the health crisis. But we are constantly seeking effective methods and better channels of communication to explain our actions and counter fake news, which spreads far more quickly than the facts, also in the economic world. The ECB was the first central bank to acknowledge its errors with regard to the projections and to analyse the reasons for them.   And what are these reasons?  The errors were largely caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. Growth has declined across all economies – in advanced, emerging and developing countries. And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world, apart from in China. A very worrying situation, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6% in October 2022, more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3%. That means that within one year, the efforts made – along with base effects, i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago – have slowed the pace of inflation.  But that’s not the general feeling in Europe…  It’s hard to explain that the rise in prices is slowing down. Inflation persists, but it is abating and even steadily declining. That’s good news. I think our efforts have played a part in this, as have some of the economic policies pursued in Europe. At the same time, growth is weakening, which is why the International Monetary Fund has revised down its growth projections worldwide, except for the United States.  Why this gap with Europe?    Potential growth in the United States has traditionally exceeded that of Europe or of the euro area by close to 1 percentage point on average. It’s not meaningful to compare them: you can’t compare a single country with several countries. The euro area comprises 20 different countries, 20 different fiscal policies, 20 different treasuries. For a start, the United States is protected by the dollar, an international reference currency. The US economy is far more responsive and adjusts more rapidly. And it is not energy-dependent, unlike Europe, which has to import 80% of its energy.   Growth is falling in Europe. Is there a risk of recession?  We have revised down our growth projections to 0.7% in 2023, 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. The rate for 2025 is only slightly below the potential growth of the euro area. In Europe, we have devised a response and deployed unprecedented defensive measures that would have been unimaginable just three years ago, notably thanks to the Next Generation EU programme. Structural reforms are being put in place. And, just one year ago, who would have thought that we would succeed in replenishing more than 90% of our gas reserves by September 2023? This allows us to look towards the coming winter, if not calmly, then at least with a lot more confidence.   The German economy, the largest in the euro area, is slowing down sharply. What impact will this have?  This is one of the factors that is indeed weighing on the outlook for European growth. Germany had built its economic model on very cheap energy supplies and on export opportunities, especially to China. The ongoing adjustment in the German economy is affecting the growth outlook.   Does that complicate the ECB’s mission?  First and foremost, the ECB has to answer the question of how to provide price stability for economic actors across the entire euro area. To this end, we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area, as well as underlying inflation – excluding energy and food.  In France, people are acutely aware of inflation. Why is that?  High and persistent inflation affects people’s purchasing power. But overall, while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average, for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.  Is this also due to the rise in interest rates?  Not exclusively. The ECB rates are the same for France as for all euro area countries. We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.  Doesn’t this threaten growth?  Our mandate is price stability, and interest rates are our tool. We raise rates to make the financing of economic activity more expensive in a manner that dampens demand, and to thus bring about an adjustment between supply and demand, notably through reduced investment and consumption. The goal is obviously not to create a recession, but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and, above all, prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral. We must avoid this at all costs. We want to get inflation back to 2%, and we will achieve that.  Is there a risk of a wage-price spiral?  We aren’t seeing that for the moment, but we are monitoring it closely. Wage growth is expected to be around 5.3% in the euro area in 2023, and that figure is projected to be 4.3% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2% over the coming years.  Is the housing crisis that is picking up pace in France and Germany collateral damage from monetary policy?  The ECB sets the key interest rates in view of its price stability mandate. The housing sector is indeed sensitive to interest rates. But for many of the problems, all authorities need to get around the table and think about the stock of housing supply, and about social housing in particular. The fact remains that the major risk would be if people get into debt without having adequate means and are then confronted with repayment deadlines they cannot meet.  Is the ECB pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook?  There are three reasons why we are not pessimistic. We expect growth figures to increase next year. Inflation is currently falling significantly. And the employment rate is higher than it’s ever been in Europe, and it’s stabilising at that level. The big question right now concerns businesses. Will they accept absorbing part of the salary increases that will be negotiated this year and next in their margins – which didn’t change much in 2022? This is a key question. In our economic projections, we assume that businesses will behave as they have done during previous crises, in that they will reduce their margins a little in order to absorb part of the salary increases. The fall in demand should point them in that direction. It’s in their interest to do so, as public opinion will put them under pressure, as will the public authorities. The second element that is very important is energy prices. I think we have to get used to the idea that oil prices will remain high. This should spur us to pursue the fight against climate change even more vigorously, and to shift towards an energy mix that is less dependent on fossil fuels and foreign suppliers.  Anxiety is growing in European society in the face of a number of measures taken to fight climate change. How should we react?  We cannot wait. Combating climate change is imperative – we should all be hammering that message home. Everyone needs to realise it’s an emergency. We will only achieve this energy transition if we have everyone’s support, and with distributive policies that don’t worsen inequality. We cannot allow the energy transition to fail. Nor can we allow the consequences of climate change to become long-lasting. That is not an option. We have to find the fiscal and social means to make it as painless as possible for everyone, and for the most vulnerable in particular. A collective approach is needed. If there is any area where Europeans should borrow collectively, invest and share the burden as equally as possible, it’s the fight against climate change.  What will follow the current version of the Stability and Growth Pact?  I hope the European Heads of State or Government and the finance ministers will reach an agreement before the end of the year. The sooner there is an agreement on a reformed fiscal framework, the earlier we have clarity on the path of fiscal policies going forward.      \n",
      "Content 16:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Jutarnji list   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Marina Klepo on 29 September 2023 6 October 2023    From the ECB's perspective, have the new [September inflation] data brought about any changes in terms of the drivers of inflation growth?    Overall, the recent news on inflation is encouraging. Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably, and it now stands at 4.3% after peaking at 10.6% in October of last year. A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks, as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly. It is also a consequence of statistical effects, the so-called base effects, given that we had unusually large price increases a year ago. When it comes to core inflation, which excludes energy and food, it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5% in the euro area, hence above headline inflation. However, its September print was lower than expected.  It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly, but it is still well above our target of 2%, which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, that “last kilometre” may well prove to be the hardest.  How worrying is the oil price increase that we have witnessed in recent months?  The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on, because we could have new supply side shocks stemming, for instance, from energy or food prices. This year, we’ve experienced frequent extreme weather events, which may have an impact on harvests and lead to higher food prices next year. In addition, the base effects from energy may eventually reverse, putting upside pressure on inflation. Therefore,  we must not be complacent, and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.  What does it mean for the broad expectations among economists, the financial markets and even among central banks, that there will be no need for further interest rate hikes? That’s at least how the latest ECB messages have been interpreted.  One has to look carefully at what we communicated. We said that our decisions will continue to be data dependent. Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2%. However,  we cannot say that we are at the peak or for how long rates will need to be kept at restrictive levels. This will depend on the data, so we will continue to look at three factors: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all of them are moving in the right direction. But I still see upside risks to inflation. There could be new supply side shocks. Moreover, wages could grow more strongly than expected, potentially accompanied by lower-than-expected productivity growth, while firms might not absorb those higher costs through their profit margins. Such risks need to be monitored carefully. If they materialised, further interest rate hikes could be necessary at some point.  Even though inflation has slowed considerably, there are still major differences in inflation rates among countries, ranging from negative numbers in the Netherlands to almost 9% in Slovakia. To what extent do these differences affect the setting of monetary policy? Are they really taken into account?  Our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. Naturally, our monetary policy decisions also take into account information from individual Member States, but we cannot respond to specific developments in a particular country. Such developments are best tackled by national policies, such as fiscal or structural policies. The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation. There are several reasons for the large role played by energy: First, countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation. Second, governments responded differently to the energy price shock, with some governments imposing price controls, which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on. Of course, these measures also had different fiscal implications, because some of them expire automatically when energy prices fall, while others need to be actively reversed, which typically takes longer. And finally, the institutional characteristics of energy markets differ across Member States. In some of them, wholesale energy prices translate quickly into retail prices, both when energy prices rise and fall. In other countries the response is more sluggish due to the fact that there are fixed-price contracts in place with a long duration. One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices, which constitute a large share of the consumption basket. This heterogeneity complicates our monetary policy, but we nevertheless need to focus on the euro area as a whole.  The government in Croatia, as well as in some other countries, is trying to introduce price controls on energy and certain basic consumer items. What is your view of these measures, what are the good and the bad sides of such an approach to lowering inflationary pressures?  Measures that directly control prices, such as price caps, have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which may be reversed once the measures are lifted. This helps to smooth inflation over time, but it also distorts the steering effect of prices. This may be counterproductive, because it does not incentivise lower consumption, for example, of energy. In addition, such measures can weigh heavily on the fiscal budget, especially if they are broad-based rather than targeting the more vulnerable groups. In general, measures that increase the supply capacity are preferable to those that directly control prices.  But do they work in the short run?  In the short run, they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation, which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers, as these often depend on current developments in inflation. But overall, the negative effects often outweigh the positive.   One of the problems in Croatia, which has one of the highest inflation rates in the euro area, seems to lie in ample excess liquidity in the banking sector. This has increased strongly since Croatia joined the euro area on account of banks’ lower minimum reserve requirements. The argument is that this impedes the transmission of higher ECB interest rates and prevents a stronger impact on inflation. What do your analyses on the success of monetary policy transmission in Member States indicate?  What matters for monetary policy in a currency union is excess liquidity at the euro area level and not at the country level. Excess liquidity in the euro area is very high, but this does not impede monetary policy transmission. We have seen that the increases in our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, have been fully transmitted to the money market and have translated into a measurable increase in funding costs in the economy. But you are right, monetary policy transmission can play out differently across Member States. One crucial factor is the prevalence of variable versus fixed-rate loans. The average lending rates adjust more quickly if there is a higher share of loans with a variable interest rate. Croatia is a special case, given that it joined the euro just recently. The drop in minimum reserve requirements from a level of 9% to 1% led to an increase in excess liquidity in the system. However, the strong loan growth that we are seeing in Croatia is not related to this but to the relatively strong economic performance, which is partly driven by the boom in tourism. That is why the Croatian National Bank decided to further increase the countercyclical capital buffer for banks to counter excessive loan growth. This is another way of dealing with the heterogeneity in a currency union, using macroprudential tools at the national level.  Would that be in the national central bank’s domain?  Yes, these macroprudential tools are mainly decided at national rather than European level – in Croatia’s case by the central bank – so they can be adjusted to the specific situation in a given country.   Do you see tourism as the main contributor to economic growth and credit activity in Croatia?  It is definitely one of the factors driving growth in Croatia’s economy. It has always been a very attractive place for summer holidays, and its attractiveness has probably increased since it joined the euro area. Two of my daughters, for example, travelled to Croatia recently, not only because it is beautiful, but also because it now has the euro.  The general public is concerned by the fact that banks are faring the best under the current circumstances, because they are generating high income from central banks without any effort or risk.   This is related to the high volume of excess liquidity created by our previous monetary policy actions: the lending operations and bond purchases, which we call quantitative easing. Excess liquidity is remunerated at our deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. In line with our interest rate tightening, we have now started to shrink our balance sheet, and this is happening very quickly, even though the balance sheet is still very large.  We need to pay interest on reserves, at least at the margin, to make sure that short-term money market rates are closely anchored to our policy rate and therefore in line with our intended monetary policy stance. Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control. Now, what seems to create most of the unease is that banks raised their lending rates much more quickly than they passed these increases on to their depositors. But this transmission is getting stronger. Rates on time deposits have risen quite a bit, and we also see that people are beginning to shift their funds out of sight deposits into alternative investments that pay higher interest rates.  This market mechanism eventually forces banks to adjust their deposit rates. But this also means that banks’ funding costs will go up over time. Even though the impact on profitability is very positive in the short run, longer-term consequences of higher interest rates on bank profitability may well prove to be less benign, because the interest income on bank assets may rise more slowly than their funding costs.  The ECB recently abolished the remuneration paid to banks on minimum reserves, but there are proposals for an increase in the minimum reserve requirement ratio at euro area level to reduce liquidity in the system. What is your view on this?     In July, we had a comprehensive discussion on the minimum reserve requirements and their remuneration. We came to the conclusion that, from a monetary policy perspective, it would be appropriate to keep them at a level of 1% but to remunerate them at 0% instead of applying the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. Let me stress three points.  First, our main tool for adjusting our monetary stance is our policy rates and not minimum reserve requirements. Second, minimum reserve requirements are linked to the volume of deposits, which means that they mainly affect banks with high holdings of deposits rather than those with high holdings of excess liquidity. Therefore, they tend to put a larger burden on smaller banks. Also, these higher reserve requirements may lead to “avoidance strategies” by banks, which could remunerate deposits by even less or shift them to entities outside the euro area, where there are no minimum reserve requirements. Lastly, we are currently discussing the design of our future operational framework for monetary policy implementation. As long as we do not know the role that minimum reserve requirements will play in this new framework, we should be cautious about making any far-reaching decisions.  In any case, the reduction of excess liquidity through the shrinking of our balance sheet will continue for some time and, eventually, all our asset purchase programmes will go into full run-off.   Economic growth prospects have worsened quite substantially, with the possibility of recession not being excluded from forecasts. What is your understanding of the drivers and the consequences of this recent deterioration in the business climate?  Over recent months, we have seen that most economic indicators point to a slowing growth momentum. We first saw a pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector, which started to spread to the services sector as the reopening effects from the pandemic faded. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for manufacturing are in deeply contractionary territory, and those for services are also signalling contraction. Consumer confidence has increased notably over the past year but remains at low levels. All this is pointing to subdued economic developments over the rest of this year.  While a technical recession cannot be excluded, there are no indications of a deep or prolonged downturn. One reason is the labour market, which is still quite resilient, resulting in strong nominal wage growth. As inflation falls, real incomes are rising, which supports economic growth going forward. What is clear is that our monetary policy will continue to have a dampening effect on economic growth.  So, there is no reason for concern of a deeper recession setting in?    We see indications of a period of stagnation but not of a deep or prolonged recession.  Still, the state of the economy in Germany, as a country that is a very important export market for many EU Member States, is not encouraging. How justified are the claims that Germany is currently the “sick man of Europe”?   Germany is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. Its economy has been hit twice: by the energy price shock and by weaker growth in China. This has exposed structural weaknesses linked to the dependence on cheap energy and on a booming economy in China that was eager to buy German manufacturing products. On top of this, Germany faces challenges regarding demographic developments, as it has a rapidly ageing society implying an increasing scarcity of labour, as well as the green transition which, as in many other countries, is facing political obstacles. Cyclical factors, i.e. weak domestic and foreign demand, will eventually fade, but the structural factors may weigh on potential growth and hence have longer-term effects. All this implies that  Germany, as is the case with many other countries, will need to adjust its business model to the changing global conditions, as well as to its domestic challenges.  How likely do you think that is?  Germany has managed to transform itself in the past and I am confident that it will be able to do so today. Naturally, this requires strategic thinking and openness to change. In particular, the green transition offers Germany vast opportunities to regain its technological leadership. The economy will pick up eventually, but the main issue concerns long-term potential growth, and that depends very much on how Germany tackles its structural challenges.  Arguments that the global economy is generally entering a phase of weak growth and disinflation are gaining ground. What do you see as having the most impact on inflation looking ahead?  What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics. When input costs rose sharply, many firms raised their prices in excess of the cost increase. So we saw an increase in profits in many sectors, also due to temporary supply-demand imbalances caused by bottlenecks and reopening effects. As a result of rising prices, employees experienced a drop in real wages. Now employees are trying to regain lost purchasing power, and tight labour market conditions are making it easier for the unions to negotiate higher wage increases. It is through such second-round effects that inflation becomes more persistent. The weakening of the economy, which is partly due to monetary policy transmission, makes it harder for firms to pass through higher wage costs to prices, meaning they may need to absorb higher costs through their profit margins. We see indications that this is happening. How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation, particularly underlying inflation, will be going forward.   There is a major difference of opinion as to how corporate profit margins over the last period have spurred inflation growth, with some analyses pointing to the conclusion that they were totally irrelevant.  Inflation is not only the result of rising wages or higher energy prices. Profits have also increased quite a lot over recent years. Looking ahead, the question is by how much wages will increase and to what extent rising wage costs will be absorbed by profit margins. It is only natural to expect that the unions and employees will try to regain some of the lost purchasing power and that wages will grow. But it is crucial how firms respond, and that depends on demand conditions and hence on our monetary policy.  Fiscal policy is expected to be prudent and cautious in order to curb inflation. However, politicians have their own concerns, such as a decline in the living standards of their citizens and in investment. On account of its widening fiscal deficit, Italy is again in the spotlight, and so is an increase in its bond yields. How does one reconcile these opposing goals?  We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years, which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures. However, we have also learnt over the years that consolidation should not come at the expense of necessary public investments. What really matters is the composition of public spending, which should aim to make the economy more productive and to strengthen the supply capacity. This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term. Therefore, it would be unwise to postpone public investments and structural reforms that are necessary to transform the economy. This is where the European funds come into play. The Next Generation EU programme can help countries to continue investing in their future. At the same time, the perception that the government can counter every economic shock through fiscal transfers is dangerous and could lead to unsustainable fiscal dynamics.    When it comes to recent yield movements in global financial markets, the largest part is driven by a general repricing of longer-term rates, as markets are anticipating interest rates to be held at a high level over a longer period of time. These higher funding costs imply that governments need to be even more prudent.  The ECB’s position that the price of borrowing will remain high for as long as necessary to reach the target inflation rate has been communicated quite clearly. Nevertheless, is there anything else that can be said in that context?     Our policy is data dependent, which implies that the level and duration of restrictive rates will depend on how the data develop. What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner. That is then also embedded in inflation expectations. One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly “anchored” around our target, in spite of painfully high inflation rates. Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.   \n",
      "Content 17:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold 2 October 2023  It’s been two weeks since the ECB raised rates for the tenth consecutive time, have you now done enough to tame inflation?  Let me stress an issue, which is sometimes slightly overlooked but is a very important part of the discussion, namely the transmission of monetary policy. That's crucial in order to understand the decisions that we have taken and those that we will take. In transmission you have two different legs. The first one is from our monetary policy decisions to financial markets and banks. In that first stage, the transmission is almost complete. You can see it. In the banking channel, there has been a tightening of financing conditions following our decisions. And there has been a significant drop in the demand for credit.  The second phase is how the impact of the tightening of financing conditions feeds through to the real economy. And here there is much more uncertainty. We have seen a slowdown in economic activity. But there are other factors behind that, for instance the impact of inflation on households’ disposable income and the evolution of exports, which is related to the slowdown in the global economy. The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy, and indirectly to inflation. That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates, if maintained over time, will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.   Do you worry about the risks of overdoing the tightening of monetary policy and driving the economy into an unnecessarily painful recession?   We do not at all want to create an unnecessarily painful recession. We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy. This is, at the end of the day, a very delicate balance. If the transmission is incomplete, then we should be a little more patient. If the transmission is much closer to completion, then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.   Does the recent rise in oil and gas prices, coupled with a weaker euro, make your task more difficult?   Yes, it makes our task more difficult. I would not say that it is a game changer. But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.   What would it take for the ECB to start cutting rates?   Well, we are not there.   But what would you need to see?   First of all, progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability, i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way. Starting to talk about rate cuts now is premature. We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Still, I think the last stretch is going to be more difficult. We are on our way towards 2 per cent. That’s clear. But we must monitor that very closely, as the last mile will not be easy.   But would the last mile be the hardest to achieve in bringing inflation down?  First let’s look at the factors in favour of disinflation. Base effects have an impact. Supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away. And there is monetary policy and the clear slowdown in the economy. In the second half of the year the economy in the euro area will have stagnated.  Now let’s turn to factors against disinflation. There’s a spike in oil prices. Wages are growing about 5 per cent on average. Demand for services is high, even though we have started to see a clear slowdown. And the euro has depreciated.  So, when you put all this in the balance, our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months. But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.   Are governments making inflation worse by continuing to run big deficits?   The first factor with respect to fiscal policy is the withdrawal of the subsidies granted over the last two years, which must be completed before the end of 2023. But it’s not only that. There is also the fiscal stance, which sometimes gets overlooked. My impression is that after four years without EU fiscal rules, governments may have got used to a little bit of a “whatever it takes” approach with respect to fiscal policy. But that has to change. Having a tightening of monetary policy and, simultaneously, an expansionary fiscal policy would be a very bad policy mix. And being more concrete, what would be detrimental is a fiscal deficit that goes above the level of 2022.   Does the ECB need to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system?   We are doing that. And this is totally normal in the process of normalisation of monetary policy. That is the correct pace, the correct path. TLTRO reached €2.1 trillion and now we are a little bit below €500 billion. And over the next year it will become close to zero.  What about stopping reinvestments in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme?  Some of my colleagues in the Governing Council have been quite outspoken with respect to the need for starting the process of quantitative tightening on the PEPP. But in the formal structure of the Council, we have not even started the discussion. It will arrive sooner or later.  Do you still need the flexibility of PEPP reinvestments as the first line of defence against financial market fragmentation, despite not having used it for two years?  If you ask the military, they will tell you that extra lines of defence are always good. Yes, we could use flexibility in the reimbursement of the PEPP to address fragmentation. It has not been used for two years because spreads are quiet. The PEPP is less than €2 trillion. Therefore, even doing a full run-off, the withdrawal of liquidity will not be huge. It is the first line of defence in times of volatility in markets, but that is not the case now. So, we’ll have to analyse it.  How about the banking system? Do you expect an increase in non-performing loans?  Return on European banks’ equity has clearly improved because of the widening of net interest margins after the increase in interest rates and it is now above 10%. Two years ago, it was around 4%. But banks’ valuations have not moved in parallel. Why? I think that the main reason is because the cost of equity of the European banks has increased quite a lot and it’s close to 15%. When interest rates increase, the cost of equity also goes up. Markets are also pricing in that the improvement in profitability will not be sustainable over time because they are factoring in an economic slowdown. And they price in that banks will have to increase provisions should non-performing loans levels go up.  This means profitability will be dented in the future. The current figures are a sort of illusion. In the pipeline, we start to see that the quality of the assets is deteriorating, and there’s an increase in non-performing loans. On top of that, taxes on bank profits have created some uncertainty.   Should countries not introduce bank taxes?   Not all bank taxes are identical. You have seen that in the case of Italy. The final proposal is much more sensible than the first one. Our point is very clear: these taxes should not impair credit and should not create any limitation in the capitalisation of European banks. This applies as well in terms of the banks being prudent in dividend payments and share buybacks, and even the remuneration of bankers.  Some members of the Governing Council would like to increase the minimum reserve requirements for the banks, on which you pay no interest. What do you think of that?  My opinion is that we should conduct monetary policy based on price stability, not on the profit and loss of national central banks. To reach price stability, you have to reduce liquidity. The reduction of liquidity will give rise to a reduction of these windfall profits that the commercial banks are getting at the moment because of increasing interest rates.   Are there any signs of distress in the property sector?   In commercial property there has been a very important decline in prices, mainly in some Nordic countries. The main problems have appeared in Sweden, Finland, the Nordic countries. But it’s quite pervasive. Residential real estate is more resilient. But, for instance, in the case of Germany, it was not a total surprise to see the recent data showing that house prices have declined by almost 10%. That’s a clear indication that there were some pockets of overvaluation that are going to be corrected. Our concern now are the non-banks, the property and mutual funds, that have a big exposure to real estate. I would say that commercial property – even though we also need to pay attention to residential property – is our main source of concern in terms of financial stability.   \n",
      "Content 18:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Market News International    Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 22 September 2023  27 September 2023  Your speech at   Terschelling   was something of a departure for a central banker, in that it was clearly very personal, while at the same time seeking to counter a certain pessimism regarding attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Are you concerned that there isn’t sufficient buy-in at the moment from, as you put it, “those who pollute, those who finance the polluters, and those who supervise the financiers of the polluters”?  Looking back at the past five years, there are many things that clearly show we are not transitioning to a zero-emission economy fast enough, with all the problems that brings economically. On the other hand, many other things are going in the right direction. My main message was that we can do this, but we need to be fast. The later the transition, the higher the cost, as our recent economy-wide climate stress test has shown. So I might have used a little more pathos than I would have done if speaking here in Frankfurt, but the message is just as clear.  Is the ECB doing enough?   As supervisors we have a multi-year strategy. We published our expectations for climate-related and environmental risks in 2020. In 2021 we asked the banks to conduct self-assessments of where they stood vis-à-vis these expectations. On the basis of what we saw a year ago, the glass is slowly filling up, but it is not yet half full and it needs to be full by the end of 2024. I do see progress – banks are now better equipped to manage climate-related and environmental risks than when we made our initial assessments. Each of our expectations has been met at least once by a bank we supervise. The glass is filling up – but it is not yet full. Building on what the banks themselves found reasonable, we set a series of interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year, the second at the end of 2023 and the last – by which banks need to satisfy all our expectations – at the end of 2024. And we have said that we will use all our instruments to enforce these deadlines if needed.  Banks understand that we mean what we say and that this is within our mandate, because climate-related and environmental risks translate into financial risks which must be managed by the banks. This is also acknowledged worldwide. Although you do still see differences in how fast and how ambitious supervisors are, the fact of these risks being within their mandate is no longer controversial. That is a real step forward, and one which also reflects the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example.  But in that speech and others you’ve highlighted the urgency that’s required. Is that compatible with what is arguably still a very gradualist approach aimed, essentially, at trying to bring banks along with you, rather than you saying “you absolutely have to do this now, and if you don’t there will be consequences”?  First of all, ask the bankers. I don’t think that they would say that this is extremely gradual – many banks probably feel that we are pursuing this rather enthusiastically. There are clear deadlines − also interim deadlines − and we will enforce them if necessary. To be very clear, that includes periodic penalty payments. That’s not a step we take lightly, so I think that this shows how serious we are when we issue supervisory expectations. Do I particularly like that? Well, I believe it’s better to convince the banks. I know we’re asking a lot, and some banks would say it’s very difficult and claim that they can’t really do anything because they lack the data. But it is also true that the risks don’t become smaller just because they are difficult to measure. There is still a lot you can do short of perfection. But the risks are out there, and they will not wait until 2030 or 2050 to materialise – so we need to make real progress. Patchy data are better than no data at all. The same is true of the emerging art of climate modelling. Patchy climate models are better than nothing, but if you don’t even identify the gaps, you cannot really make progress towards filling them. There are many other things banks can do besides climate modelling, and we have also published a guide of best practices for banks that sets out these numerous options.  So looking at it from other directions, is there anything more that the ECB could, or should, be doing beyond compliance, such as making green investment more attractive? Might we one day see the green TLTROs (targeted longer-term refinancing operations) that commentators were discussing not so long ago?  Whereas up to now we’ve been speaking about what we are doing in our banking supervision, you are now asking a question about what we might consider in our monetary policy. Talking about possible future instruments is of course highly speculative, because whenever we design an instrument, we take into consideration all the circumstances of that particular moment. Any instrument needs to be effective to pursue our primary mandate of price stability, and it needs to be proportionate. It also depends on the environment – whether we are in a period of policy tightening or accommodation. But climate considerations are clearly part of the monetary policy strategy we adopted in 2021. I think it’s fair to assume that we will take climate considerations into account in the features of any type of instrument we may design in future − including any purchase programme.  In your speech you also mentioned the extent to which national governments subsidise fossil fuel industries. Obviously, there are limits to the ECB’s mandate, and maybe this is pushing those limits. But insofar as this issue constitutes a financial stability risk, can the ECB play a greater role? Or should it be left to private citizens to pursue the issue through the courts?  You’re talking to a lawyer, and the overriding requirement through all of this is that we act within our mandate. And when I talk to banks, I point out that we are seeing exponential growth in climate-related litigation. From our perspective, banks need to manage that risk at a time when there are certain cases in which the courts have endorsed rather far-reaching legal theories, including against states. It can no longer be taken for granted that those judgments will not be repeated or set a precedent, and that is something banks should be acutely aware of.  You said recently that there will be a just transition or no transition. Could you unpack that a little?  What I wanted to say there is that, if you look at what is happening in the world, it is clear that there is a risk of a growing antagonism – that the energy transition and climate crisis become politicised. All EU Member States have committed to becoming Paris Agreement-aligned. Not delivering on that, or postponing the transition, will lead to an economically suboptimal situation where the transition ends up being more costly. Our own analysis has also shown this time and again. Bringing attention to this issue is within our mandate.  If we could turn to monetary policy – In your last Governing Council meeting, the ECB raised interest rates again. For the final time in the cycle?  We have said it very clearly: we consider that, with the decisions we’ve made and on the basis of our current assessment, the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term. Does that mean policy rates have peaked? Not necessarily. There is still a lot of uncertainty. That’s why we take these decisions meeting by meeting, on a data-dependent basis. Making any predictions about what we will do next would not be consistent with that approach.  How do you see the balance of risks to the inflation outlook? Is it simply that the latest hike puts the ECB on a sounder footing by guarding against any additional upward price pressures?  I think that’s exactly what it is. Of course, there are upward risks to inflation. There could, for example, be upward pressures on food and energy prices – since July we have been alluding in our monetary policy statement to the importance of weather and climate conditions in this respect. Climate change could also lead to a shift in longer-term inflation dynamics, but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation. Helpful distinctions have also been proposed by my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Isabel Schnabel, analysing the impact of climate change itself, the ongoing dependency on fossil fuels and the green transition. Some aspects are certainly inflationary – 2022’s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67% compared with the year before, for example, so that’s rather significant. But it could also be the case that, over much longer horizons and depending on how the transition goes, energy will become much more abundant and cheaper.  Do you see any evidence that the current interest rate environment is having a negative effect on green investment?  Any interest rate decision has an effect on investment, both green and non-green. In the end, I think the best we can do is make sure that we deliver on our price stability mandate. That will create the stable environment in which the transition – including the required investment, which needs to be sped up – can take place.  How concerned are you about the growth outlook for the euro area? Or does the primary mandate of price stability ultimately matter more?  What we’re seeing is a more protracted period of sluggish growth than we were expecting. Of course, we need to look at the various explanatory factors, such as lower demand for euro area exports, the impact of tighter financing conditions, lower residential and business investment, and the weakening services sector. On the other hand, labour markets are still strong and disposable income is expected to rise, which would have a stabilising effect on overall GDP growth. It’s also true that our primary mandate is to deliver price stability, and I think we have proven we are very determined to do that, as seen in the ten rate hikes that we’ve decided on since July 2022.  So would you consider cutting rates if growth were to surprise significantly to the downside in the coming months?  I think I’ve explained very clearly how we take our decisions. We take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and we look at all the incoming data. We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments, and we will weigh any incoming data carefully, as always, in relation to our inflation outlook.  Would you need to see inflation clearly and consistently trending below 2% over the course of your medium-term projections before considering a cut appropriate? Equally, would reinvestments need to have stopped by that time?  Let me stick to what I have just said. As you know, we stand ready to adjust all our instruments as needed. Based on today’s assessments, we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target. We will keep rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.   \n",
      "Content 19:   INTERVIEW  Interview with Yahoo Finance   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jennifer Schonberger  22 September 2023  You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?  Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.  So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?  So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.  So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?  Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.  As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?  I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.  You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?  Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.  Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?  This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.   \n",
      "Content 20:   INTERVIEW  Interview with The Currency   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Stephen Kinsella on 31 August 2023 5 September 2023  Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?  We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.  In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?  Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.  Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.  Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.  I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?  I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing. This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.  I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.  I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?  Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.  Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.  I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?  Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.  Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.  Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?  I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.  I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?  The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.  Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?  Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.  Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?  We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.  We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic!  For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?     \n"

      "Content 1: INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 2 February 2024 7 February 2024  Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.\n",
      "Content 2: INTERVIEW  Interview with De Volkskrant   Interview with Frank Elderson,  of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Jonathan Witteman on 29 January 2024 3 February 2024  In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.\n",
      "Content 3: INTERVIEW  Interview with Die Zeit   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Kolja Rudzio 31 January 2024  Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!\n",
      "Content 4: CONTRIBUTION  Thanks to Wolfgang Schäuble   Contribution by Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB, French and German members of parliament and other personalities, published on n-tv.de Frankfurt am Main, 22 January 2024 A Franco-German homage and appeal  As a young member of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble founded the Baden-Alsace discussion group together with the Mayor of Colmar, Joseph Rey. In his last ever campaign appearances, he supported pro-European parliamentary candidates in Alsace and Lorraine. Born during the war, raised in the French occupation zone, elected in the border region of southern Baden, friendship with France was close to his heart throughout his life – as the foundation for a strong Europe.  As a minister, Wolfgang Schäuble worked in close contact with his French counterparts. He was the first German finance minister to participate in a meeting of the French cabinet at the Élysée Palace. He formulated the aspiration to always take French and European interests into account: “If a solution is good for Europe, then it is good for Germany. And if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany”. German unity and European integration, open borders and joint security, a strong euro as a guarantee of stability – these fundamental convictions shaped his actions.  As President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, together with the then President of the French National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, spearheaded the establishment of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on 25 March 2019 in Paris; this joint chamber, comprising 50 German and 50 French members of parliament, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both Presidents had previously signed the Franco-German Parliamentary Accord, which – some 56 years after the Élysée Treaty – adds a parliamentary dimension to the Franco-German friendship as an intergovernmental agreement, thus raising it to a completely new level. None of this would have been possible without Wolfgang Schäuble’s impassioned efforts alongside his colleague in Paris.  Even in his last interview – published on 24 December 2023, just two days before he passed away – Wolfgang Schäuble called for reviving the Weimar Triangle as a “German-Polish-French engine for Europe” and strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities: “Let’s follow this European path. Only by working together can Europe play an economic, military and environmental role in the world.“  That is his legacy. And that is why the state memorial ceremony in his honour is quite rightly taking place on 22 January, “Franco-German Day” – exactly 61 years after the signing of the Élysée Treaty and six years to the day since Wolfgang Schäuble became the first President of the Bundestag to address the French National Assembly on 22 January 2018. In that speech he described the Franco-German friendship as \"a gift from history\", but one owed to the vision of courageous people who, after the world wars and the crimes committed by Germany, showed the way to reconciliation. Wolfgang Schäuble said: “What has been achieved inspires us to move forward” and added “Let us use the freedom we enjoy today. Let us live up to our responsibilities as courageously as the original signatories. Together! ”  Wolfgang Schäuble more than lived up to these responsibilities, and did so honestly and tirelessly. Yet the state memorial ceremony in the German Bundestag with Emmanuel Macron is more than just a tribute to great merit. It is a mission and an appeal. It is a mission entrusted to us, as leaders in politics and society, to bring the European vision to life in a spirit of close partnership. And it is an appeal to young people to keep enthusiastically pursuing the idea of Europe. Peace, freedom and friendship cannot be taken for granted, we have to work for them again and again. As for European integration, it is far from complete and must continue to be shaped, with determination – and by those who are truly European at heart, as was Wolfgang Schäuble.  We will honour Wolfgang Schäuble's memory with immense gratitude for his life's work. We pay tribute to a great German, a great friend of France and a great European. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Wolfgang Schäuble.\n",
      "Content 5: INTERVIEW  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini 13 January 2024    The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?  The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.  Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.  The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.   What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?  The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.  Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.   Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?  Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.   The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?  I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.  It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.  Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?  For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.  Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?  The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.   Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?  For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.  Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?   We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.   There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?  Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.  Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?  That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.  EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?   A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.  Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?  We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.  Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?  It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.\n",
      "Content 6: INTERVIEW  Q&A on X   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted and published on 10 January 2024 10 January 2024 Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% inflation is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: \"central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s\". Yet, we have seen how inflation has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the \"normal mechanism\" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of \"austrian\" or \"hard-money\" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As inflation falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about inflation reacceleration or does the link between Growth/Inflation (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Inflation has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on inflation in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee inflation reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to inflation as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling inflation raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying inflation are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that inflation is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and inflation. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly disinflationary before the pandemic and inflationary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of inflationary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our inflation target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average inflation after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act inflation after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average inflation?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, inflation will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term inflation and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or inflation.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and inflation is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core inflation above 2% for the entire year. At which level inflation would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that inflation sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the disinflationary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate inflation BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see inflation returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect inflation to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Does the ECB take into account the asymmetries that are produced from its policies due to the fact that the EZ is not a proper monetary union? Do you think it should/shouldn't? Thank you   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further steps in European integration would clearly benefit our single monetary policy. Therefore we need to make further progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union. #AskECB    @ecb   Why would any Country give up their sovereign currency knowing that money can be printed instead of borrowed ? The US,UK,Can... have retained their sovereignty, they are in a better situation to react to \"shocks\" in the economy. natural or man made.   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro area countries have decided to give up their own currencies and join the euro. A currency union reduces transaction costs and facilitates trade by removing exchange rate risks. The euro enjoys wide support in all member countries. #AskECB   Also, how far can BVB go in the Champions League this season?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: All the way! #AskECB  Time to wrap up for today. Many thanks for your questions – I really enjoyed our chat! Take care, @Isabel_Schnabel #AskECB\n",
      "Content 7: INTERVIEW  Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit   Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit by Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB  3 January 2024 When I think of Wolfgang Schäuble, the first image I see is him sitting across from me at the table of the French cabinet in the Élysée Palace, the first German finance minister to participate in such a meeting. I see him sitting at the negotiating table in Brussels, at one of our many meetings that ran long into the night. I hear the straight talker who never shied away from difficult decisions. I remember the dedicated public servant, a master of diplomacy with the intellectual ability to understand opposing viewpoints. I see a natural statesman with the courage to stand by his convictions as well as the pragmatism to recognise the world as it is. And I see a man of loyalty and kindness.  The recent passing of my dear friend and colleague saddens me deeply, and my heart goes out to his family. Yet I take comfort in remembering his remarkable achievements for Europe. I recall his own words in this regard because they capture his clear commitment to both Germany and Europe: “If a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.” Few have done as much for Germany and Europe over such a long period as Wolfgang, with his more than half a century of public service. As minister of the interior, he was at the heart of Germany’s reunification process. It was a moment of profound change for the country and for all Europeans, and one that had to be handled with great care in view of the sensitivities of neighbouring countries to German history. Wolfgang understood that one of the best ways for Germany to demonstrate its responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours. That was no small matter in a nation so proud of the Deutsche Mark. But he knew that a single currency would bind Europe together and protect the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations, and that this was in Germany’s and in Europe’s best interests. When Europe’s sovereign debt crisis came, Wolfgang was a calming influence, reminding us that the euro is much more than just a currency. His defence of Europe was unwavering and absolute. Nevertheless, he was always self-reflective, and later asked himself how things could have been done differently, potentially causing less suffering. Wolfgang’s intellectual rigour stemmed from his ability to combine the subtlety of a diplomat with the attention to detail of a lawyer. It was a quality that put him at the forefront of discussions in the 1990s on how to build a more deeply integrated European framework.  His statesmanship would have been welcome in today’s challenging environment of extreme views. His success did not come through a forceful personality, but from understanding how to find common ground with others. This approach has served Germany and Europe well. In my experience, Wolfgang’s philosophy was consistent: stay true to yourself and to your democratic institutions. Now is a timely moment to remember that as we remember him. I will miss my dear friend, and the birthday flowers he sent me over many years!\n",
      "Content 8: INTERVIEW  Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Meike Schreiber und Markus Zydra on 18 December 2023 22 December 2023    Inflation has recently fallen to 2.4%, more rapidly than expected. Are you satisfied?    We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2%. We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term, as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire, such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services. We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2% by 2025.  So, we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.   But you do want to go the last mile?  We must go the last mile: we have an inflation target of 2%.   Would 2.1% not be enough?  We want to return to 2% on a sustainable basis.   There is war in Ukraine and Gaza. How much do global crises influence the central bank’s work?   Geopolitical shocks lead to uncertainty and thereby affect economic decisions. At the same time, they can also push up energy prices and hit world trade by disrupting supply chains – which we see happening in the Red Sea right now. Geopolitics can also influence the green transition, if the supply of commodities, such as those required for producing solar cells or batteries, is restricted for political ends. All of this affects our core business: the fight against inflation.   Your policy rate decisions are data-dependent, as you always emphasise. How useful are historical data to you when, as at present, the global situation is constantly changing fundamentally?  Historical data are valuable as one can derive patterns from them. But the world can change very quickly. We then need to adjust our analyses, without discarding historical knowledge. The macroeconomic environment has indeed changed radically over the past few years. We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then – owing to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine – quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation. Looking at the period of low interest rates would hardly help. But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.   Inflation was very low in the past decades. Was that mainly because of the central banks’ sound monetary policy? Or was it partly luck, thanks to globalisation for example?   It was both. After the great inflation of the 1970s, monetary policy changed fundamentally. Central banks have become more independent and have a clearer mandate: price stability. This has increased the credibility of monetary policy. But there have also been macroeconomic trends, particularly globalisation and China’s entry into the world market, which played an important role and brought down inflation.  Has the fight for stable prices got tougher?   Since 2020 there have been several severe external shocks. That makes monetary policy more challenging.   Will inflation be higher in future than it was before?   Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2%. At the same time, we may be confronted with more supply-side shocks. And these could turn out to be inflationary, even though that is hard to predict. Climate change, for example, drives prices, we see that already. Extreme weather can push up food prices, low water levels in the Panama Canal increase transportation costs, and carbon taxes raise the price of fossil fuels. A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well. But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence, which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.   When you joined the Executive Board in 2020 you wanted to smooth the fractious relationship between Germans and the ECB. Did you manage to do so?   The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB. It has enabled us to strengthen the ECB’s credibility.   But the ECB was too slow in combating inflation. Many people haven’t forgotten that.     We acted relatively late, but all the more decisively. We sharply increased interest rates within a short time, and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation. Inflation was initially caused by rising energy prices and disrupted supply chains owing to the pandemic and the war. These constrained aggregate supply, while demand remained robust. Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations. We succeeded in doing that. It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2%.   Inflation has fallen, but the higher prices continue to put pressure on people.  The prices are clearly higher than before the pandemic, and monetary policy cannot roll back that increase. And people would not be better off if we plunged the economy into years of deep recession just to bring the prices back to their old levels.  Would you manage, though?  With massive consequences, but this is not the task of monetary policy. An energy price shock makes an economy that is reliant on energy imports poorer overall. Somebody has to bear those losses.  When you have achieved your 2% inflation target, is there a risk of forgetting that the high level of prices is as good as entrenched now?  We target inflation, not the price level. Also in the past, it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.  The quick and sharp interest rate hikes have led to banks suddenly making record profits. Is this fair?  Our decisions are guided by our price stability mandate. But they have side effects, including their impact on bank profits. Banks have lent money at higher rates, but they have not passed the higher interest rates on to their depositors immediately or in full. But we expect banks’ profits to be under more pressure in the future because banks will face higher funding costs and rising credit default risks, while lending is weakening. Banks would therefore be well-advised to use these short-term profits to build up a buffer against future losses.  But banks tend not to do that, opting to pay out dividends instead. Erring on the side of caution would certainly not hurt the banks.  The high profits are also boosted by the 4% deposit facility rate which banks receive on their excess reserves. The ECB could shrink these deposits by raising the minimum reserve requirement. Why has it not done so?  In July we decided to no longer remunerate the minimum reserves while keeping the minimum reserve requirement at 1% of the minimum reserve base, which consists mainly of customer deposits. The minimum reserve requirement is not an effective way of compensating the remuneration of excess liquidity. Large banks have the highest excess liquidity, smaller banks have less. At the same time, the smaller banks are mostly funded by deposits. This is why they would be disproportionally affected by higher minimum reserve requirements.  By the same token, large banks are subsidised with the deposit rate, because many smaller lenders only have low excess amounts that are remunerated.  Banks are not subsidised. But the effects of our measures do vary. For example, during the pandemic the ECB granted longer-term loans that have strongly benefited smaller banks. At the same time, until recently banks were charged a negative interest for their excess liquidity, and that affected large banks more. There are no banks that are systematically at an advantage or a disadvantage. All banks are important for the transmission of monetary policy.  The ECB could sell all the sovereign bonds – that would solve the excess reserve problem. The ECB’s balance sheet has already shrunk significantly. This will continue in the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity. But the primary monetary policy instrument is ECB policy rates. The reduction of our balance sheet is happening gradually in the background, also to avoid market turbulence. While we are not expecting any, we are not taking any risks.  The ECB is making losses now because it has to pay high interest to banks while holding low-yielding bonds. A central bank that is making losses doesn’t look too good.  Our bond purchases were always guided by monetary policy considerations. Take the pandemic emergency purchase programme. This measure probably averted a serious financial crisis that would have wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s lives. The ECB’s losses cannot be viewed out of context.  But they do damage your reputation.  We always assess whether our measures are proportionate, and losses can damage the central bank’s credibility and independence. In the future, this might lead to a certain reassessment of bond purchases.  How do you assess the ECB’s bond purchases?  Bond purchases can be employed for achieving two distinct goals: price stability on the one hand, and market stabilisation on the other. They were very successful in stabilising the financial markets. But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation. At the time, one problem was the very restrictive fiscal policy. Governments failed to make use of the low interest rate period to invest, and this made life difficult for monetary policy.  The lesson here is that fiscal and monetary policy need to pull together.  When you joined the ECB in 2020, inflation was low, the key interest rate below zero and central banks were making profits. This has all changed. How has it affected you?  I have learnt that the world can change much more quickly than you think. The central bank needs to react swiftly in such situations, and this is a challenge. But I think that we have done pretty well in the past four years.\n",
      "Content 9: INTERVIEW  Interview with 20 Minutos   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Emilio Ordiz and Jorge Millán 21 December 2023  Wage cost data in Spain point to an increase of 4.7%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that domestic inflation is resisting and is largely predicated by wages. Do you think wage moderation is required to beat inflation?  A year ago inflation was above 10% and now it is below 3%. Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable, i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation, basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade, and because monetary policy is taking effect. However, average wage growth in the euro area is over 5%, whereas productivity is barely improving. This means that unit labour costs are rising, which adds to inflationary pressures. In 2022 profit margins increased considerably, but this year the increase has been more moderate. This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs, which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.   What will the ECB do in this situation?  We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins, as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2% target. We are keeping a very close eye on this.  The EU is emerging from this crisis better than it did in 2008. What do you think has changed?  We have the experience of what happened in 2008 and the two crises are completely different. The 2008 crisis broke out on the back of extremely high private sector debt levels, which had a significant impact on the banking sector. The response was also very different. For the crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic, there have been no limits to fiscal policy, and this has been accompanied by monetary policy that has also been very expansive. In addition to this, the European Union came up with an action plan for all countries throughout the bloc, providing them with funding through the Next Generation EU programme.  However, the situation has now changed. Almost all income indicators have returned to their pre-pandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation. To this end, the ECB takes action through its monetary policy but we also need to see fiscal policy return to normal.   With euro area inflation at 2.4% in November and euro area GDP stagnating for the past twelve months, how do you explain to people why interest rates are being kept so high?   Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do, which is bring inflation down. Monetary policy operates by tightening financing conditions: higher interest rates affect levels of economic activity. And when economic activity is dampened, inflation slows. Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2%, monetary policy might then start to ease. But it’s still too early for that to happen.   When can we expect to see the first interest rate cuts?   If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time, current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2%. We are data dependent. The data have been favourable but still not enough for us to change our monetary policy. It’s therefore too early to talk about a cut in interest rates.  What do you think about opinions from certain quarters that the ECB is sort of following in the slipstream of the US Federal Reserve?  The US economy’s fundamentals and cycles differ from Europe’s. US fiscal policy has been much more expansive, growth is higher and the rate of unemployment, below 4%, is even lower than in the euro area. With an unemployment rate of 6.5%, our labour market is in good shape, but on the whole the economies are in different situations. As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, what the Federal Reserve does is relevant, but it does not determine the ECB’s monetary decisions.  Do you think that now is the time for completing banking union? This debate always seems to be ongoing but never seems to reach a conclusion.  Completing the banking union is essential if we want full economic and monetary union in Europe. There is one pillar missing: a European deposit insurance scheme. European elections will be held in June 2024, offering another opportunity for this. Completing banking union should be on the future European Commission’s agenda, as should making progress on a fiscal union through the introduction of a common fiscal stabilisation function.  Do you think there is the risk of a recession if, for example, the war in Ukraine drags on?   The ECB does not expect a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But beyond whether or not a recession will occur, the main issue is that Europe’s economy has a structural growth problem. Both our projections and those of the European Commission see very moderate growth of around 1% up until 2026. These potential growth levels are low because productivity is barely improving. Europe needs to import more energy than other global economies. As a result, the energy crisis further exacerbates its competitiveness issues. Structural reforms are therefore necessary. The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, but to achieve growth, other factors must be brought into play.  What would these reforms have to be?  One would be completing banking union, as I mentioned. Clear progress also needs to be made towards the capital markets union, and also in the single market of the European Union. Not much is said about the latter, but we are in a situation where there are hardly any limits on state aid, which creates imbalances between countries, depending on their fiscal position. The focus basically needs to be on Europe's low growth potential, how to increase productivity and the reforms needed to boost growth in the medium term.  Do you think it would be feasible to standardise the formula for the European Union’s Next Generation funds?  The Next Generation funds were a response to the pandemic and had two very positive aspects: the issuance of joint debt and the fact that part of the aid consisted of grants rather than loans. Beyond the clearly positive effects of the programme, it ultimately highlights that we need to complete our economic and monetary union. And to do so it is vital to have a permanent centralised fiscal policy instrument, and to implement structural reforms.  Staying with the European Union, there was an agreement on fiscal rules yesterday. How does the ECB see it?   Markets are calm and interest rates on sovereign debt have even fallen. But this can change relatively quickly in the context of low growth, tight monetary policy and geopolitical risks. That is why it is very important to have a clear framework of common fiscal rules. We welcome that there's an agreement because that reduces uncertainty in the markets.  And what is the ECB calling for?  Our recommendation is that the framework should be simple, transparent, easy to understand and countercyclical. In other words, it should allow fiscal policy to be expansionary in bad times and contractionary in good times. Fiscal action plans need to ensure a prudent and sustained reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in structural deficits. They should also create fiscal space for public investment in digitalisation, climate change or defence, and should provide incentives for structural reforms.  In the end, would you say that the EU has completely ditched austerity?  Sometimes it is not clear what is meant by “austerity”. Fiscal sustainability is essential, and, at the same time, fiscal rules have to allow for countercyclical action. And to be able to increase the public deficit during an economic downturn, countries need to rebuild their fiscal positions and reduce their public deficit when the going is good. Beyond fiscal policy, one basic difference between the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis was the very different monetary policy response, providing liquidity to banks and launching a pandemic asset purchase programme that has ultimately provided immense support to the European economy.  Do you think southern European countries have learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis?  Banking systems are much healthier than they were in the period from 2008 to 2011. And that is a key change. Moreover, these countries have made efforts to become more competitive and have a balance of payments surplus. For example, Greece and Portugal have made very significant budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in the risk premia and the ratings agencies. Many southern European countries have made considerable efforts to improve the sustainability of their public finances in the medium term. That is why it makes no sense to now try to create some kind of north-south divide between EU countries.   One of the most important projects the ECB is currently working on is a digital euro. How is it going and what are its key components?  At the moment, we all have euro banknotes in our wallets. A digital euro would be exactly the same, just on our mobiles. It would basically be the banknotes we have now, but in digital form and also backed by the central bank. We want it to be an additional, alternative means of payment. It is not meant to replace banknotes but to complement them. There would also be a limit on the amount of digital euro you can hold. In other words, it would be a means of payment but not a means of saving. We want a digital euro to be more comparable to banknotes than current accounts.  Do you share the Government’s optimism about the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy has a healthy banking system, which is completely different to how the situation was in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the economy is competitive, with a surplus in the balance of payments. It is important that both are maintained in the future. The external sector, including international tourism, has helped a lot in restoring income to pre-pandemic levels.   Are there any challenges?  Education still needs some work. This affects medium- and long-term growth because there are mismatches between labour supply and demand. The 12% unemployment rate means there is room for improvement in the labour market. Like some other euro area countries, Spain has a high public debt-to-GDP ratio of 110%. It is therefore important that these countries implement a prudent adjustment programme to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP.  All countries are going to face major challenges: economic slowdown, geopolitical risks, a new framework of fiscal rules or higher interest rates. That is why economic policy must be predictable.  The last two questions have a Spanish context. What do you think about Nadia Calviño’s appointment as the next president of the European Investment Bank?   Naturally, as a Spaniard, I think it is positive that Spaniards hold key positions in the European Union. I wish her and the institution all the very best.   And in the same vein, particularly seeing as you have held the post that Calviño now leaves, who would you like to see occupy the position left vacant by her?  It is not my place to comment on domestic affairs. I am sure whoever is appointed will be competent and I wish them every success.\n",
      "Content 10: INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2023 5 December 2023  What is your take on the unexpectedly benign November inflation reading? Does the recent string of downside surprises change your view about the inflation trajectory?  “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” I’m sure you know this famous quote that is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly. This was due to the reversal of the previous supply side shocks and was mainly driven by energy and food prices. Base effects played a significant role. The November flash release was a very pleasant surprise. Most importantly, underlying inflation, which has proven more stubborn, is now also falling more quickly than we had expected. This is quite remarkable. All in all, inflation developments have been encouraging. That said, despite these positive developments, I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely. We continue to expect an uptick over the coming months. There’s going to be a reversal of some fiscal measures and of some base effects, and we cannot exclude that there’s going to be a new price spike in energy or food. Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2% target. Our monetary policy is working. The restrictive policy is contributing to dampening growth in aggregate demand. Economic growth has been weak over the past several quarters, and it’s expected to remain weak this quarter before gradually picking up next year. This period of below-potential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2%. So, I believe we are on track, but we need to remain vigilant.  Are we still on the inflation path you outlined in your September projections?  Let’s see what our December staff projections are going to show. But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2% no later than 2025. This is our main objective.  What is your assessment of growth since the September projections?   Some of the hard data we see are not very good. But some of the soft data are giving us hope. The purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) seem to be bottoming out and they’re even showing a small uptick. Of course, this is from very low levels. But it is in line with our projections. Growth is then expected to pick up gradually next year, mainly due to rising real incomes, which should foster confidence and consumption. All this will depend, to a large extent, on the development of the labour market, which has been very resilient. We have seen that firms have held on to their labour force in spite of weakening economic growth. This is only sustainable if they expect growth to pick up. If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market, this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process. But while we do see some softening in the labour market, we do not expect a significant deterioration or a deep and prolonged recession.  Do you see a risk that the rapid drop in credit demand could exacerbate the downturn?  What we’re seeing is that monetary policy transmission is working. There has been a sharp increase in lending rates and a strong slowdown in loan growth. This is exactly what we wanted to see.  Markets are pricing an early spring rate cut but the ECB has guided for steady rates for several quarters. How do you view this discrepancy?  Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year. Central banks are more cautious, and I would argue they have to be more cautious. After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution. If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a sustainable manner. This should happen no later than 2025.  According to our staff projections, the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame. Transmission is working – lending growth is slowing, the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing. We are right on track. But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation. The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum. We now need to see whether this is sustained. We’ve seen very strong wage growth and weak or even falling productivity, leading to a sharp increase in the growth of unit labour costs. This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular, which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained. We’re going to watch upcoming wage agreements very closely. This will certainly also matter for our monetary policy decisions.  If the current level of restriction is sufficient, does that mean you do not see a need for further rate increases?  The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.  What is sufficiently long? Do you also see several quarters of steady rates?  We need to see more data. There’s first likely going to be an uptick in inflation. So, this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now. And most importantly, we need to see what’s going to happen to underlying inflation, to wage growth, to productivity, to unit profits. In order to be confident that we will sustainably return to our target, we need more time.  Am I reading it correctly that you’re not ruling out a rate cut before mid-year then?  We remain data dependent. That’s the main thing. We have to see what’s going to happen. We have been surprised many times in both directions. So, we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months’ time.   What is your view on the timeframe for ending pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments?  As President Lagarde mentioned, the Governing Council is going to discuss reinvestments under the PEPP in the not-too-distant future and I’ll leave it up to you to interpret what that means. It’s clear that discussion is going to come. It’s also clear that at some point we’re going to fully end PEPP reinvestments. The amounts involved are relatively small and markets are expecting this to happen, so I think it’s not such a big deal.  Am I correctly reading the mood that even if reinvestments end, there is no appetite for outright sales of bonds in either the asset purchase programme (APP) or PEPP portfolios?  We have never discussed outright sales.  You gave a speech in March in which you made the case for a demand-driven system for the ECB’s new operational framework. How has you thinking evolved since?  What I said in that speech is that a demand-driven system is well-suited for a heterogeneous currency union that may be prone to fragmentation. Such a system also likely limits the size of the central bank balance sheet. Of course, it can be designed in many different ways. What we are doing in our framework review is trying to find a system that implements our monetary policy effectively and efficiently in a way that minimises the negative side effects. So, the new system has to take into account the specificities of the euro area financial system. It has to be firmly embedded in our legal framework and it should limit our market footprint. But one should be aware that we are starting from a situation of abundant excess liquidity. So whatever framework we choose, money market rates will initially remain close to the floor.  What is the timeline for the balance sheet to shrink to its optimal size?   That depends on various factors that we can’t project perfectly. It also depends on the framework that we will eventually choose. One of the main drivers of the size of the central bank balance sheet is the growth of what we call autonomous factors – banknotes and official sector deposits – and the growth of reserve requirements. These factors already imply that the balance sheet is going to be around three times as large as before the global financial crisis.  In addition, banks could have a higher demand for excess liquidity for regulatory or precautionary reasons. If the outcome of the review was a demand-driven system, the size of the balance sheet would thus also depend on banks’ demand for excess liquidity. This would mean the size would not be determined by us, which is a good thing, because we don’t know precisely what the demand is.  The Federal Reserve has gone with the floor system. Could two of the world’s biggest central banks operate with different frameworks?  I do not see any problem with that. If you look around the world, you see many different frameworks.  The Fed has a supply-driven floor, the Bank of England a demand-driven floor, and Sveriges Riksbank a narrow corridor, while many central banks in emerging markets have a classical corridor. So, there is a wide variety of models out there that are tailor-made for specific financial systems.    Do you see the need for a structural portfolio of bonds and/or longer-term bank loans? What would the size of such a portfolio need to be?    I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of the framework review. There are different ways to provide liquidity to the financial system and all of them are going to be discussed in the review. We are going to weigh up the benefits and costs of each of them, and it could make sense to have a mix of different tools. We need to keep in mind, though, that this only matters far out in the future, because we are starting from a situation where we have a huge monetary policy bond portfolio. The structure of the balance sheet only becomes relevant when it has to grow again. As regards a structural portfolio, I mentioned in my March speech that this could be considered. Also keep in mind that we de facto already have a structural portfolio because some national central banks are holding bonds in their Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) portfolios.  What do you mean by “far out in the future”? Could it be next decade?  That depends on the decisions we are going to take. If we decided on both longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio, we would have to think about a potential split. But this really depends on many factors and I do not want to make any predictions. What is clear is that the balance sheet has to be much larger than it was before the global financial crisis. But, for all the frameworks under consideration, the balance sheet is going to be much smaller than it is now.  Should the ECB introduce new longer-term refinancing operations?  We will discuss the different options available to provide liquidity to the banks, including longer-term operations. But such a facility would have to be different from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) we were offering during the pandemic, in that it would have to be offered at market rates. From the banks’ perspective, longer-term lending operations are attractive because they provide a certain reliability of funding. And they reach all parts of the banking sector directly. That is very different from asset purchases – when you inject liquidity, it typically ends up with the larger banks and in certain financial centres.  Do you see a case for increasing the minimum reserve requirements, as some of your colleagues advocate?  We had a discussion on minimum reserve requirements in July and we discussed both the calibration and the remuneration. We decided to keep the minimum reserve requirements at 1% but to remunerate them at zero, instead of at the deposit facility rate. The reason for this was proportionality. With this change, we can implement our monetary policy stance in the same way and equally effectively while paying lower interest to the banks. That was the justification for reducing the remuneration. The proportionality argument implies that, if we have two options and one of them leads to losses while the other is just as effective in achieving price stability but reduces these losses, then we should choose the option that generates smaller losses. But let me stress that the minimum reserve requirements are not a tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. They also have distributional effects – they have the greatest impact on the banks with the highest deposit base, which tend to be the smaller banks. We are going to discuss the role of minimum reserve requirements in the operational framework review. And until then, we will not take any decisions.  To what extent should profit and loss considerations matter for monetary policy decisions?  Our monetary policy decisions are determined by our mandate. Profit and loss considerations matter only insofar as they affect our credibility and, consequently, our ability to pursue our mandate.  Andrea Enria argued recently that shadow banks need closer scrutiny, and the ECB could theoretically conduct this supervision. If the ECB supervised them, it could also provide them with access to liquidity facilities. Is that needed?  The experience of the pandemic shows that we are able to distribute liquidity across the financial sector without giving non-banks direct access to our balance sheet. At the moment we are not considering opening up our balance sheet to non-banks because there is no clear case for that.\n",
      "Content 11: INTERVIEW  Interview with De Standaard and La Libre Belgique   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Ruben Mooijman and Ariane van Caloen, on 23 November 2023 29 November 2023  Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.   What would you say to those who think that banks are making excessive profits?   The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, which has just been published, indeed shows that bank profitability has risen sharply. This improvement can be attributed to the widening of interest rate margins. The return on equity of euro area banks now stands at around 10%, whereas in 2019, barely five years ago, it stood at 4%. So it has clearly improved.  Still, this is something of an illusion − it is after all a short-term improvement. In the long term, we expect profitability to fall again. Why? There are several factors. First, the economy is slowing, which will lead to higher default rates and a decline in asset quality. Second, banks will have to pay more to attract deposits. On term accounts, for example, interest rates have already risen sharply. Likewise, the bonds that banks issue themselves will need to carry a higher return. So overall the cost of bank funding is on the rise. And finally, an often-overlooked factor is that demand for credit is falling. Putting all that together, you can see that high bank profitability is not sustainable. In fact, the financial markets are already convinced of this, as bank share valuations are in no way reflecting expectations of high profits.  Are the banks sufficiently covered for interest rate risks. If not, could the regulator, the ECB, review its requirements?   The interest rate risk of European banks can’t be compared to that run by some US banks such as Silicon Valley Bank with a different business model. The repricing of loans, in other words, raising interest rates in line with the market rate, has been much faster than the repricing of deposits in Europe. However, the interest rates on deposits will also increase at some point.  So is interest rate risk adequately covered?  Yes, but at the same time banks will be facing a loss of profitability as I said. I am talking about the average for the sector.   There has been a lot of debate about interest rates on savings. Politicians are taking initiatives to get banks to raise interest rates. Is that a good idea?  If the ECB raises interest rates, it is for borrowers and savers. Lending rates have risen and the remuneration of deposits is expected to follow suit. The remuneration on savings accounts should reflect our interest rates. That is part of our monetary policy transmission. Because if savings become more attractive, consumers will spend less, reducing demand. This is what we aim for to push down inflation. However, we now see banks are delaying passing on higher interest rates to savers. They can do that because they still benefit from abundant liquidity right now. But we are also taking measures to reduce excess liquidity, so that higher interest rates on savings accounts will become a reality – sooner or later.  Do you see differences between member states in this respect?  Yes, there are differences. In some countries, banks are quick to adjust interest rates on deposits, and in others, such as Spain, they are lagging behind. Euro area banking sectors also differ in the way mortgage loans are granted, whether it is at variable or fixed rates. Strengthening of profitability was particularly notable for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates and the pass-through of higher policy rates to deposits has been slower.  And Belgium?  I know the Spanish situation because it’s my own country, but we look at euro area averages and developments as a whole.  Some economists criticise the system that allows banks to make money easily by depositing their excess liquidity with the ECB. This is resulting in generous profits at the moment because interest rates are rising. What’s your take on this?  The ECB has raised its interest rates with a view to these increases being passed on to all remuneration categories in bank balance sheets. The level of liquidity in the market was extremely high and had to be reduced. This reduction is under way now and will go hand-in-hand with a decline in these types of revenues for banks.  You have also changed the remuneration of the minimum reserve requirement for banks. Some bankers believe that this should be raised to ensure a stronger capital base. Do you think that’s a good idea?  We have indeed set the remuneration of banks’ minimum reserves to 0%. The levels of those reserves have so far not been changed or discussed. I know some central bank governors are in favour of increasing them. We have limited the remuneration on the minimum reserve requirement, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of banks’ liabilities. I understand that remuneration of reserves is important for some banks, but monetary policy shouldn’t be driven by the financial position of banks or the profits of the central banks. Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.  National central banks are going to have to report significant losses owing to the policy of quantitative easing, which led to huge purchases of sovereign bonds to inject liquidity into the market. Do these losses pose a problem?  It’s true that central banks are currently reporting losses owing to the hike in interest rates, but if we look at a longer period of time, for instance over the last 10 years, the net outcome is positive in terms of central bank profits.  What about the real estate market? People are complaining about the higher cost of loans. What would you say to them?   What is happening is part of our monetary policy. The sharp rise in interest rates is starting to dampen real estate prices. This is more apparent in some countries than others, but a moderation in price trends can be seen everywhere. On average, house prices are stabilising. The decline in commercial property prices is much more pronounced.   Does the situation pose a danger?   It could affect banks, but fortunately they are less exposed to commercial real estate than they are to residential real estate. Commercial real estate is more often financed through other channels, such as mutual funds. But in the financial system there is a high degree of interconnectedness, so we look at the overall picture.  Huge investments are needed to make homes and other buildings climate-proof. Are the higher interest rates delaying funding for investments aimed at combating climate change? Could that slow down the climate transition?  It’s true that substantial investments are needed, but I think they should mainly be financed through subsidies and European funds like the Next Generation EU. This is a matter for fiscal policy. That doesn’t alter the fact that the ECB conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing rates without discriminating between sectors or borrowers.   Monetary policy also affects the climate transition in other ways. Some investments are being jeopardised by higher financing costs. This has already resulted in plans for various wind farms being scrapped.  The ECB pays close attention to climate policy, but for us it’s a secondary objective. It’s national governments that play the leading role in climate policy, through taxes and subsidies. We can contribute though – and we do. For example, we prioritise climate-friendly companies in our corporate bond portfolio. This is a small contribution, but it sends a clear signal in the fight against climate change.  The ECB is preparing to introduce a digital euro. Why is that necessary?  We currently have a physical euro in our wallets, whereas the world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. There is a very natural evolution taking place from a physical to a digital euro backed by the central bank. We see the digital euro as a means of payment. We would be able to use this form of public money to pay for our shopping, our bill in a restaurant or all sorts of purchases. Like banknotes, the digital euro will not have to be remunerated. There will be a limit on the amount of digital euro people can hold, to avoid endangering the stability of the banking system. This means that the digital euro won’t compete with current accounts. That is a very clear message we want to send to the banking sector. The digital euro will not be an investment product but a simple means of payment to complement banknotes.  Won’t implementing the digital euro be very expensive for the ECB?  This will be part of our calculations during the preparation phase over the next two years, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted but, in my view, the benefits will outweigh the costs. It will offer another alternative means of payment to those living in the euro area. It will also enable us to take another step towards European strategic autonomy. And at the end of the preparation phase the decision will be taken by the European Commission, the European Council of the European Union and European Parliament.  A number of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, are struggling with how inflation is measured. The way it’s measured means actual inflation is sometimes overestimated and sometimes underestimated. Isn't that a problem for the ECB, as it’s tasked with fighting inflation?  Indeed, changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated. But that's a matter for Eurostat, not the ECB, and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward. Statistical changes to the compilation of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) occur from time to time. A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not. As you know, that was one of the conclusions of our monetary policy strategic review. We work and share information with Eurostat on that topic, with a view to enhancing the HICP. But not on the measurement of energy prices, which is a statistical choice to how the country’s price index is compiled.  Europe is planning to use the profits from frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear to help rebuild Ukraine. The ECB is critical of this. Can you explain why?  Let me first clarify that the ECB is in favour of helping and supporting Ukraine in any way possible. But our position on utilising the dividends and interest from the frozen assets is clear. First: this should be a global decision, ideally involving all members of the G7. In addition, we have to be careful because this could lead to reputational damage. We have to look beyond this conflict in isolation, and there could be implications for the euro as a safe currency. The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation. I think there are other ways to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In Belgium, the launch of the ethical bank NewB has proved very difficult. Are barriers to setting up new banks in the eurozone too high?  Without entering into the details of any particular case, there are different procedures to be followed and criteria to be met, but there are no limitations beyond the legal and capital requirements imposed for the creation of a new retail bank.  But there haven’t been very many new banks in the last few years...  Because there are a lot of banks in the euro area! The real question to ask is about banks’ traditional business model. New sources of revenue need to be found, the number of branches has to be reduced. I suppose that investors are turning away from banks because the level of profitability doesn’t meet their expectations. I think there needs to be further cross-border consolidation.  So are there too many banks?  Given the cost structure of European banks, consolidation could help provide a solution. Above all else, I think cross-border consolidation in the euro area under a single supervisor and within the framework of a single monetary policy would be positive.\n",
      "Content 12: INTERVIEW  Interview with Finance   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Albina Kenda 9 November 2023  The ECB did not change its key interest rates at its October meeting, interrupting the series of ten consecutive interest rate increases that had brought rates up by 4.5 percentage points since July 2022. A few days later Eurostat announced that euro area headline inflation had fallen to 2.9% in October. Does this mean that interest rate hikes are over?  It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level, and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2% level we define as price stability.  The evolution of inflation has been positive overall: it was above 10% only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9%. At the same time, core inflation has also been moderating. But we have to be prudent and cautious, as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months. We will continue taking a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions.   Euro area GDP was down by 0.1% in the third quarter, and economists think inflation may rise again over the coming months as the positive base effect will progressively fade out. At the same time, there is a risk of another commodity price shock arising from the situation in the Middle East. If the ECB finds itself at a crossroads, will it prioritise growth or inflation?  Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2%. Unlike some other central banks, the ECB does not have a dual mandate.  At the same time, we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation. We expect that growth will stagnate in the second half of the year and that the fourth quarter will not differ much from the third. Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth; some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.  Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025, with some fluctuations caused by base effects. However, we believe that, if interest rates are maintained at their current levels, inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.   The ECB will publish new forecasts in December. Will these be more or less the same as in September, or are you expecting upward revisions for inflation and downward revisions for growth?   It might be premature to say it, but leading indicators point to the growth outlook being somewhat more negative than we previously projected. As regards inflation, the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.  You mentioned the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to decision-making. But in October the ECB said it considers its key interest rates to be at levels that will make a substantial contribution to lowering inflation, provided they are maintained at those levels for a sufficiently long duration. What is meant by “sufficiently long”?  This means a period of time that takes into account the potential lags of monetary policy. Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive, and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down, as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was. I would not define “sufficiently long” as used in our monetary policy statement as a concrete period of time. We will need to determine this on the basis of data. In our decision-making we will also have to take into account the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical risks related to the conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine.  But what kind of data would the ECB need to see to start reducing interest rates rather than simply keeping them at restrictive levels?  We are not there yet. We will see how things evolve month by month, but our approach now is to keep interest rates at this level long enough to reach our target. Any discussion about lowering interest rates is clearly premature.  To what extent did the ECB’s monetary policy take into account not just the euro area average but the situation in individual Member States, as there are significant differences among them, also in their level of inflation. According to Eurostat, in October Slovakia recorded the highest inflation rate of 7.8%, Slovenia registered 6.6%, while the Netherlands and Belgium recorded deflation of 1% and 1.7% respectively.  We have seen disparities among euro area countries in their economic and financial structures, in the weight of services in their economies and not least in their proximity to the conflict in Ukraine.      There are always differences in inflation and growth, but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries. Our measure of price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.  In dealing with the disparities, it is important to consider the effects of fiscal policies. With regard to base effects, we have to look at how governments have introduced, and have started to withdraw, support measures to mitigate the shocks of the energy crisis. Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries. But our monetary policy is single.  The ECB is now looking more closely, in line with other central banks, at core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. What are ECB’s main concerns in this regard? ECB President Christine Lagarde said this summer that profit margins contributed almost two-thirds to domestic inflation last year. Almost nobody mentions this anymore, but there is now a discussion about the effects of wage increases.   It is essential to focus on core inflation, for which there are several risks. First, there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation. Second, there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate, which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation. And finally, there are unit labour costs. Rising labour costs result from two factors. The first one is wage developments, with wage growth in the euro area now at just over 5%. The second is productivity, which is very low and has been declining because employment growth has been outpacing output growth.  It is true that profit margins grew even faster than unit labour costs last year. This year, however, we are seeing a moderation in profit margins, while labour costs are on the rise.  Our expectation is that part of the increase in labour costs will be absorbed via profit margins, meaning that not all of this increase will be passed through to final prices.   At the ECB, you are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to deepen your understanding of inflation. What will you do differently from what you have been doing so far and what do you hope to achieve? We know that, while not the only one, you have been wrong as far as the inflation forecast is concerned.   Our colleagues working with statistics deal with a lot of information, a lot of data on the financial system and the real economy, so any instrument that helps us manage this monumental amount of information is very useful.  So we are continually looking for algorithms that can give us a better understanding of what is happening in the economy, in the financial system, and a way of factoring in all the underlying tendencies that are embedded in the data we analyse.   There have been warnings that in its fight against inflation the ECB has been focusing only on the demand side of the economy, while supply-side factors also contribute to inflation. Is a more balanced approach warranted for the future, bearing in mind the pressures that may stem from geopolitical tensions, the demographic picture and the implications of the Green Deal? The economy has already been disrupted, is monetary policy next?  Sometimes it is important to stress that monetary policy works through interest rate increases, through the transmission of monetary policy decisions to financing conditions and then through the impact of financing conditions on aggregate demand.  So, monetary policy and the transmission of its decisions aim to influence aggregate demand, consumption and investment. Monetary policy cannot deal with supply-side issues. These need to be addressed through structural policies and fiscal policies.  Let me add that it’s not only the origin of inflation that’s important, but also the possibility of second-round effects, which can make the situation much more complicated, with a possible price-wage-profit spiral. In particular, we need to avoid de-anchoring inflation expectations, as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.  It was announced a while ago that the ECB, in cooperation with Eurostat, would include housing costs in the calculation of inflation. How far along is this project?  This was part of the ECB’s strategy review, and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation. However, such costs need to be well calibrated in the index, and this is mainly Eurostat’s responsibility. Including the cost of owner-occupied housing in the measurement – known as the owner-occupied property cost – contributes to the calibration of inflation. We are very willing to cooperate with Eurostat and provide our input and insights.   So there is no deadline?  It is not up to us. But there is a need for harmonised action at EU level, not just in the euro area, and this takes time.   The ECB has dealt with record-high euro area inflation by raising interest rates at a record pace. In the banking systems of several countries, including Slovenia, borrowers have felt the effects of this policy much more than savers. Is this also due to the consolidation of the banking market and the subsequent lack of competition?   You are right about the effects. As you know, we have made it crystal clear: whenever we raise our key interest rates, this increase should be passed on to all sides of the market.  The current situation can be explained by several factors. First, there is excess liquidity, so banks haven’t been under pressure to raise the remuneration of deposits. However, liquidity conditions are becoming less and less comfortable for European banks – there have been changes to the parameters for long-term liquidity lending to banks under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and changes to our bond-buying programmes, so the decline in liquidity will continue. Second, banks are always slower to change their pricing policy for deposits than they are for loans.  But there is a slow-but-steady increase in the remuneration of deposits, particularly time deposits. We believe that this process will continue. We are monitoring it very closely and, I’ll say it again, when we raise interest rates, we are not only raising them for borrowers, but for savers too, because otherwise the transmission of monetary policy would be incomplete.   Given that deposit interest rates lagging behind lending rates has resulted in considerable growth in banks’ net interest income, could you say that banks are pursuing short-term goals instead of long-term sustainable business goals, especially as you said yourself that the ECB is now determined to reduce excess liquidity in the system?  You’re right – the profitability of European banks has improved recently owing to the increase in key interest rates and an improvement in profit margins.  However, this has not been reflected in the market valuation of banks because markets believe that this improvement in profitability may not be sustainable over time. First, because the economy is slowing, which could lead to an increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Second, because the drop in demand for loans would reduce banks’ revenues. And third, because the cost of funding for banks is rising.  So I think that it’s quite obvious that, despite the improved profitability of banks, there are doubts about how sustainable this will be in the longer term.   What are the challenges to financial stability in the euro area now that we are in a phase of economic slowdown? What is the situation regarding insolvency proceedings, non-performing loans and risks to the banking system stemming from the real estate market? In Germany, residential property prices fell by around 10% in the second quarter. Do you expect a correction elsewhere as a consequence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening?  When interest rates go up, the financial stability situation changes. The first factor we have to look at is valuations of financial assets and real estate assets. One of the main risks we see in terms of financial stability in the euro area is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment of asset prices and the implications it could have for banks. It should be stressed that banks are in a good position in terms of profitability, capital and liquidity. But we cannot be complacent because, as I said, there are some doubts about how sustainable this improvement is going to be over time.  There is another factor for financial stability. We look very carefully at non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly real estate mutual funds. In this regard, we have seen a significant drop in commercial real estate valuations. This decline had set in before the start of the monetary policy tightening but has now accelerated following the rise in interest rates. A number of non-bank financial intermediaries have seen very steep declines, particularly in commercial real estate.  In addition to economic cooling, we are also witnessing a housing crisis across the EU. How do you respond to the criticism that the ECB’s monetary policy has contributed to this, first with bond purchases that lowered bond yields, which led institutional investors to turn to the property market for returns, and now by increasing borrowing costs, which has caused many building projects to be postponed or completely abandoned?  We can be criticised for being too lenient or for being too tough. But, if I may say, I don’t think it’s fair to be criticised for both things at the same time. There were reasons why we had a very expansionary monetary policy – think back to the pandemic and the decline in GDP. I think that without our monetary policy, the situation would have been much worse. Going back even further, to the era of quantitative easing, you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis. However, sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge, and we had to respond.  Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability. Sometimes there are lateral effects. But there are also other policies to deal with a potential real estate bubble, such as fiscal and macroprudential policies.   In other words, you are looking at developments in the real estate market through the prism of the financial stability of the banking system.  For sure. My point is that monetary policy has to be focused on price stability. However, there are other instruments available, like fiscal and other policies. In the event of real estate market growth that is not fully aligned with fundamentals, macroprudential policies can be applied, bank capital buffers can be increased and borrower-based measures can be used to limit excessive growth in real estate lending. A range of policies are available.   What are the latest trends in the credit situation in the euro area?  The evolution is quite clear: financing conditions have tightened as a result of our monetary policy decisions, resulting in a decline in credit demand, which can be seen for both households and firms. This is how monetary policy works.   My last question is on the tax issue. Banks are reporting high profits, largely due to higher net interest income. As a result, several governments have decided to levy additional taxes on them. Why is the ECB not in favour?  Our decision is based on two pillars. The first is that this kind of tax should not impair lending or the transmission of monetary policy measures to the system. The second is that such a tax should not damage the solvency of banks, as this could have medium-term consequences for banks that are not well capitalised.  We have already issued opinions for Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and now Slovenia. The taxes are not all the same, but each opinion points out that the tax should not impair lending and should not damage the solvency of banks.\n",
      "Content 13: INTERVIEW  Interview with Kathimerini   Interview with Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB, conducted by Alexis Papahelas on 30 October 4 November 2023  When you were in Athens last week, you talked about Greece’s resilience and its phenomenal recovery capacity. Could you tell me how this happened? How did Greece become a success story?  When I look at the key performance indicators for assessing Greece’s economic and financial situation, I see improvements across the board: in employment, growth, the fiscal situation and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Greece has completed many of the reforms on its to-do list. Not all of them, of course. There is still more work to be done. I understand that there are more reforms in the pipeline but, overall, the results of the country’s efforts are impressive. And this did not go unnoticed by those whose job it is to rate an economy and assess its credit rating – as shown by the two recent decisions that raised Greece’s rating to investment grade. I think it’s a tremendous testament to the country’s efforts. The turnaround was thanks to the fiscal adjustments and the reforms that were implemented, but also to the resolute efforts of the Greek people and the Greek authorities.  Is the high debt-to-GDP ratio of any concern to you?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is around 160% at the moment. It has fallen significantly in the last couple of years. And obviously this downward trend needs to continue in the future. I know there is more to come, but Greece has evidently responded to this challenge with determination, and the results are already clear to see.  Did you ever get really worried about Grexit? Did you think that it was possible?  There were two particular moments where the threat could have materialised. The first was during the French G20 presidency in November 2011, when there was talk of a possible referendum, which didn’t happen in the end. The second, when the threat was much more tangible and much more worrying, was in July 2015. So, we had two Grexit threats, but the one in 2015 was the most concrete, and if it hadn’t been for the determination of a few European leaders, it would have happened.  You had a front-row seat to the Greek financial crisis from a very early stage. When you look back, do you think that any mistakes were made?  The original mistake was for the country to have found itself in that situation. If there had been greater fiscal discipline and if the prudent principle of establishing a rainy-day fund for bad times when the economy was doing well had been applied, the crisis might not have happened. The fiscal policies in place before and after the crisis hit in 2009 were the original mistakes. As I have said before, it would have been helpful for the IMF to have had longer programmes than those available in its arsenal. The programmes it had were intended for rapid and deep changes, reforms and fiscal consolidation. At the time they weren’t necessarily the best tools for a country that was in a monetary union without a fiscal union or for Greece’s specific fiscal situation.  Did you learn any lessons or draw any conclusions of your own from the crisis?  One very pertinent lesson is to make sure that we have the collective discipline to address the lack of a fiscal union. I think this should be a very pressing concern for all of us. When you have a monetary union without a fiscal union, as we do, you need clear fiscal guardrails and a fiscal framework within which countries can design and implement their fiscal policies and be accountable to the other members of the monetary union. Something else that stands out from the Greek situation is that decisions were made but then sometimes reversed by the subsequent political team. And, even when decisions were taken, the implementation and monitoring needed to move forward didn’t always happen. Another lesson is that, even when banks are not the cause of a crisis, a solid and robust financial sector with well-capitalised banks is crucial.  Are you satisfied with the current state of the Greek banking system?  I think a lot of work has been done to consolidate and strengthen the Greek banking sector. Take non-performing loans, for example. In 2016 almost 50% of loans were non-performing. Now it is just over 8%. That is a significant sign of improvement, which has involved parking those non-performing loans outside the banks. So, in a way, the banking system has been sanitised. Capital ratios are much stronger, non-performing loans have gone down and liquidity ratios are also quite solid. So yes, a lot has been done to make Greek banks more robust and more attractive.  I think the fact that a large foreign bank is taking an interest in a Greek bank is a clear indication that the sector has become more attractive.  Do you think 10 or 12 years ago it would have been possible for you and the Governor of the Bank of Greece Yannis Stournaras to take a walk around Syntagma Square where all the demonstrations were happening? What was going through your mind when you actually did it this time?  I was totally bemused by the transformation, I have to tell you. As you know, I did not come to Greece at the height of the crisis, but I was obviously in frequent contact with the team. I was following the IMF mission’s visits very closely – special security measures were taken and it was a source of anxiety and concern. Now, to walk down the street, say hello to people and feel their energy, vitality and optimism was quite striking. It is a testament to the effort and the determination of the Greeks to turn things around and to take hold of their destiny with the discipline and seriousness required in a union like the EU. I think it’s fantastic that Greece can set standards and be an example of what to do, of what reforms to implement.  Do you have the sense that economic events are driven by geopolitics these days? How hard is it to carry out fiscal and, more importantly, monetary policy?  You and I have been around for a little while. And I think that geopolitics taking precedence over many other developments is nothing new. What I think is slightly different now is that there is a compounded effect of multiple geopolitical developments taking place in various corners of the world. Sometimes they are a reflection of a major schism happening in front of us. When the world had a bipolar power structure, when it was fairly organised and settled, you could anticipate things. You could have more certainty about future developments. Now it’s far more fragmented. Crises are taking place in various parts of the globe at the same time, and it’s not clear who is on whose side and what the next development will be, let alone the final outcome of the current crisis in the Middle East. And if you add to that the crisis that we have just gone through with the pandemic, plus the terribly serious challenge of climate change, which is a tragedy that is already unfolding, that’s a lot of geopolitical and climate-related developments taking place together. That’s what’s making it even harder at the moment, which is why I think that we are confronted with shifts and breaks that, although not unimaginable, certainly fly in the face of the traditional way of thinking or the certainties that we used to have.  Do you think that inflation will recede next year?  This is certainly our forecast and this is certainly our goal. We are determined to bring inflation down to 2%. According to our projections we will get there in 2025.  It seems as though increases in food prices and housing are almost becoming structural now. Are you worried about the political implications of all this, about the political pressures stemming from the rise in the cost of living?  When we measure inflation, we pay attention to the headline rate, which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing – how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car, food on the table, or to have clothes, shelter and everything else. But we also try to understand what is underneath the most variable components. One of those components is food. Is the price of food going to be higher in the future? That’s a possibility if you look at the impact of climate change, for example. Droughts, floods, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will most likely have an impact on food prices going forward .  As for the political implications that you asked me about, let me say that our mandate is to ensure price stability, and this is the best contribution we can make to social peace and to society, to the most vulnerable of its members in particular.  The last question I’d like to ask you is what really keeps you up at night?  I try to sleep as much as I can, and at the moment it’s not a lot, I have to say. When I go to bed, I’m really tired and I fall asleep. But what preoccupies me before I go to bed is the level of violence, hatred and hubris around, which is first and foremost terrible for people – terrible for children and terrible for civilians. And of course, in addition to the human suffering, all this will have an impact on our economies, on the level of people’s confidence, and it will probably make our job a little bit harder going forward.\n",
      "Content 14: INTERVIEW  Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Marcel de Boer, Marijn Jongsma and Joost van Kuppeveld on 11 October 2023 16 October 2023  Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.  First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.  What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?  This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.  Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?  What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.  Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.  We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.  QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?  We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate. This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.  Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?   Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.  So no lowering of interest rates until spring?  We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.  And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?  Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.   As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?  I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty. And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.  Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?  I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.\n",
      "Content 15: INTERVIEW  Interview with La Tribune Dimanche   Interview with Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB, conducted by Marie-Pierre Gröndahl on 2 October 2023 8 October 2023  The ECB raised its key interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in fourteen months, bringing the rate on the deposit facility to 4%, its highest level since the launch of the euro. Coming at a time when people are concerned about the level of interest rates, was this move justified?   We first need to put the action taken by the European Central Bank into context. For several years now the world has been facing a “permacrisis”, a constant succession of serious and unprecedented crises − in terms of their scale, their impact and the speed at which they emerged. The health crisis was followed by Russia’s unjustified war in Ukraine, and then by an acceleration in inflation. All this against the backdrop of the energy crisis, with a number of EU countries experiencing difficulties in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, including real estate.  The ECB’s mandate, unchanged for 25 years, is price stability. It’s our compass. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.     Do you have the tools you need to fight inflation?   Our models were not perfectly suited to the nature of these crises, which resulted, among other things, in the complete shutdown of part of the economy during the health crisis, leading to a greater role for governments, which suddenly became protective. They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades, or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation. The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections. We have worked on these issues, and we are continuing to do so, in order to make the projections more robust.   Have the past projection errors dented trust in the ECB’s actions?    Close to 80% of euro area citizens believe in and support the euro. And 45% trust the ECB, slightly more than did so before the health crisis. But we are constantly seeking effective methods and better channels of communication to explain our actions and counter fake news, which spreads far more quickly than the facts, also in the economic world. The ECB was the first central bank to acknowledge its errors with regard to the projections and to analyse the reasons for them.   And what are these reasons?  The errors were largely caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. Growth has declined across all economies – in advanced, emerging and developing countries. And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world, apart from in China. A very worrying situation, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6% in October 2022, more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3%. That means that within one year, the efforts made – along with base effects, i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago – have slowed the pace of inflation.  But that’s not the general feeling in Europe…  It’s hard to explain that the rise in prices is slowing down. Inflation persists, but it is abating and even steadily declining. That’s good news. I think our efforts have played a part in this, as have some of the economic policies pursued in Europe. At the same time, growth is weakening, which is why the International Monetary Fund has revised down its growth projections worldwide, except for the United States.  Why this gap with Europe?    Potential growth in the United States has traditionally exceeded that of Europe or of the euro area by close to 1 percentage point on average. It’s not meaningful to compare them: you can’t compare a single country with several countries. The euro area comprises 20 different countries, 20 different fiscal policies, 20 different treasuries. For a start, the United States is protected by the dollar, an international reference currency. The US economy is far more responsive and adjusts more rapidly. And it is not energy-dependent, unlike Europe, which has to import 80% of its energy.   Growth is falling in Europe. Is there a risk of recession?  We have revised down our growth projections to 0.7% in 2023, 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. The rate for 2025 is only slightly below the potential growth of the euro area. In Europe, we have devised a response and deployed unprecedented defensive measures that would have been unimaginable just three years ago, notably thanks to the Next Generation EU programme. Structural reforms are being put in place. And, just one year ago, who would have thought that we would succeed in replenishing more than 90% of our gas reserves by September 2023? This allows us to look towards the coming winter, if not calmly, then at least with a lot more confidence.   The German economy, the largest in the euro area, is slowing down sharply. What impact will this have?  This is one of the factors that is indeed weighing on the outlook for European growth. Germany had built its economic model on very cheap energy supplies and on export opportunities, especially to China. The ongoing adjustment in the German economy is affecting the growth outlook.   Does that complicate the ECB’s mission?  First and foremost, the ECB has to answer the question of how to provide price stability for economic actors across the entire euro area. To this end, we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area, as well as underlying inflation – excluding energy and food.  In France, people are acutely aware of inflation. Why is that?  High and persistent inflation affects people’s purchasing power. But overall, while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average, for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.  Is this also due to the rise in interest rates?  Not exclusively. The ECB rates are the same for France as for all euro area countries. We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.  Doesn’t this threaten growth?  Our mandate is price stability, and interest rates are our tool. We raise rates to make the financing of economic activity more expensive in a manner that dampens demand, and to thus bring about an adjustment between supply and demand, notably through reduced investment and consumption. The goal is obviously not to create a recession, but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and, above all, prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral. We must avoid this at all costs. We want to get inflation back to 2%, and we will achieve that.  Is there a risk of a wage-price spiral?  We aren’t seeing that for the moment, but we are monitoring it closely. Wage growth is expected to be around 5.3% in the euro area in 2023, and that figure is projected to be 4.3% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2% over the coming years.  Is the housing crisis that is picking up pace in France and Germany collateral damage from monetary policy?  The ECB sets the key interest rates in view of its price stability mandate. The housing sector is indeed sensitive to interest rates. But for many of the problems, all authorities need to get around the table and think about the stock of housing supply, and about social housing in particular. The fact remains that the major risk would be if people get into debt without having adequate means and are then confronted with repayment deadlines they cannot meet.  Is the ECB pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook?  There are three reasons why we are not pessimistic. We expect growth figures to increase next year. Inflation is currently falling significantly. And the employment rate is higher than it’s ever been in Europe, and it’s stabilising at that level. The big question right now concerns businesses. Will they accept absorbing part of the salary increases that will be negotiated this year and next in their margins – which didn’t change much in 2022? This is a key question. In our economic projections, we assume that businesses will behave as they have done during previous crises, in that they will reduce their margins a little in order to absorb part of the salary increases. The fall in demand should point them in that direction. It’s in their interest to do so, as public opinion will put them under pressure, as will the public authorities. The second element that is very important is energy prices. I think we have to get used to the idea that oil prices will remain high. This should spur us to pursue the fight against climate change even more vigorously, and to shift towards an energy mix that is less dependent on fossil fuels and foreign suppliers.  Anxiety is growing in European society in the face of a number of measures taken to fight climate change. How should we react?  We cannot wait. Combating climate change is imperative – we should all be hammering that message home. Everyone needs to realise it’s an emergency. We will only achieve this energy transition if we have everyone’s support, and with distributive policies that don’t worsen inequality. We cannot allow the energy transition to fail. Nor can we allow the consequences of climate change to become long-lasting. That is not an option. We have to find the fiscal and social means to make it as painless as possible for everyone, and for the most vulnerable in particular. A collective approach is needed. If there is any area where Europeans should borrow collectively, invest and share the burden as equally as possible, it’s the fight against climate change.  What will follow the current version of the Stability and Growth Pact?  I hope the European Heads of State or Government and the finance ministers will reach an agreement before the end of the year. The sooner there is an agreement on a reformed fiscal framework, the earlier we have clarity on the path of fiscal policies going forward.\n",
      "Content 16: INTERVIEW  Interview with Jutarnji list   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Marina Klepo on 29 September 2023 6 October 2023    From the ECB's perspective, have the new [September inflation] data brought about any changes in terms of the drivers of inflation growth?    Overall, the recent news on inflation is encouraging. Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably, and it now stands at 4.3% after peaking at 10.6% in October of last year. A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks, as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly. It is also a consequence of statistical effects, the so-called base effects, given that we had unusually large price increases a year ago. When it comes to core inflation, which excludes energy and food, it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5% in the euro area, hence above headline inflation. However, its September print was lower than expected.  It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly, but it is still well above our target of 2%, which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, that “last kilometre” may well prove to be the hardest.  How worrying is the oil price increase that we have witnessed in recent months?  The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on, because we could have new supply side shocks stemming, for instance, from energy or food prices. This year, we’ve experienced frequent extreme weather events, which may have an impact on harvests and lead to higher food prices next year. In addition, the base effects from energy may eventually reverse, putting upside pressure on inflation. Therefore,  we must not be complacent, and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.  What does it mean for the broad expectations among economists, the financial markets and even among central banks, that there will be no need for further interest rate hikes? That’s at least how the latest ECB messages have been interpreted.  One has to look carefully at what we communicated. We said that our decisions will continue to be data dependent. Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2%. However,  we cannot say that we are at the peak or for how long rates will need to be kept at restrictive levels. This will depend on the data, so we will continue to look at three factors: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all of them are moving in the right direction. But I still see upside risks to inflation. There could be new supply side shocks. Moreover, wages could grow more strongly than expected, potentially accompanied by lower-than-expected productivity growth, while firms might not absorb those higher costs through their profit margins. Such risks need to be monitored carefully. If they materialised, further interest rate hikes could be necessary at some point.  Even though inflation has slowed considerably, there are still major differences in inflation rates among countries, ranging from negative numbers in the Netherlands to almost 9% in Slovakia. To what extent do these differences affect the setting of monetary policy? Are they really taken into account?  Our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. Naturally, our monetary policy decisions also take into account information from individual Member States, but we cannot respond to specific developments in a particular country. Such developments are best tackled by national policies, such as fiscal or structural policies. The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation. There are several reasons for the large role played by energy: First, countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation. Second, governments responded differently to the energy price shock, with some governments imposing price controls, which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on. Of course, these measures also had different fiscal implications, because some of them expire automatically when energy prices fall, while others need to be actively reversed, which typically takes longer. And finally, the institutional characteristics of energy markets differ across Member States. In some of them, wholesale energy prices translate quickly into retail prices, both when energy prices rise and fall. In other countries the response is more sluggish due to the fact that there are fixed-price contracts in place with a long duration. One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices, which constitute a large share of the consumption basket. This heterogeneity complicates our monetary policy, but we nevertheless need to focus on the euro area as a whole.  The government in Croatia, as well as in some other countries, is trying to introduce price controls on energy and certain basic consumer items. What is your view of these measures, what are the good and the bad sides of such an approach to lowering inflationary pressures?  Measures that directly control prices, such as price caps, have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which may be reversed once the measures are lifted. This helps to smooth inflation over time, but it also distorts the steering effect of prices. This may be counterproductive, because it does not incentivise lower consumption, for example, of energy. In addition, such measures can weigh heavily on the fiscal budget, especially if they are broad-based rather than targeting the more vulnerable groups. In general, measures that increase the supply capacity are preferable to those that directly control prices.  But do they work in the short run?  In the short run, they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation, which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers, as these often depend on current developments in inflation. But overall, the negative effects often outweigh the positive.   One of the problems in Croatia, which has one of the highest inflation rates in the euro area, seems to lie in ample excess liquidity in the banking sector. This has increased strongly since Croatia joined the euro area on account of banks’ lower minimum reserve requirements. The argument is that this impedes the transmission of higher ECB interest rates and prevents a stronger impact on inflation. What do your analyses on the success of monetary policy transmission in Member States indicate?  What matters for monetary policy in a currency union is excess liquidity at the euro area level and not at the country level. Excess liquidity in the euro area is very high, but this does not impede monetary policy transmission. We have seen that the increases in our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, have been fully transmitted to the money market and have translated into a measurable increase in funding costs in the economy. But you are right, monetary policy transmission can play out differently across Member States. One crucial factor is the prevalence of variable versus fixed-rate loans. The average lending rates adjust more quickly if there is a higher share of loans with a variable interest rate. Croatia is a special case, given that it joined the euro just recently. The drop in minimum reserve requirements from a level of 9% to 1% led to an increase in excess liquidity in the system. However, the strong loan growth that we are seeing in Croatia is not related to this but to the relatively strong economic performance, which is partly driven by the boom in tourism. That is why the Croatian National Bank decided to further increase the countercyclical capital buffer for banks to counter excessive loan growth. This is another way of dealing with the heterogeneity in a currency union, using macroprudential tools at the national level.  Would that be in the national central bank’s domain?  Yes, these macroprudential tools are mainly decided at national rather than European level – in Croatia’s case by the central bank – so they can be adjusted to the specific situation in a given country.   Do you see tourism as the main contributor to economic growth and credit activity in Croatia?  It is definitely one of the factors driving growth in Croatia’s economy. It has always been a very attractive place for summer holidays, and its attractiveness has probably increased since it joined the euro area. Two of my daughters, for example, travelled to Croatia recently, not only because it is beautiful, but also because it now has the euro.  The general public is concerned by the fact that banks are faring the best under the current circumstances, because they are generating high income from central banks without any effort or risk.   This is related to the high volume of excess liquidity created by our previous monetary policy actions: the lending operations and bond purchases, which we call quantitative easing. Excess liquidity is remunerated at our deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. In line with our interest rate tightening, we have now started to shrink our balance sheet, and this is happening very quickly, even though the balance sheet is still very large.  We need to pay interest on reserves, at least at the margin, to make sure that short-term money market rates are closely anchored to our policy rate and therefore in line with our intended monetary policy stance. Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control. Now, what seems to create most of the unease is that banks raised their lending rates much more quickly than they passed these increases on to their depositors. But this transmission is getting stronger. Rates on time deposits have risen quite a bit, and we also see that people are beginning to shift their funds out of sight deposits into alternative investments that pay higher interest rates.  This market mechanism eventually forces banks to adjust their deposit rates. But this also means that banks’ funding costs will go up over time. Even though the impact on profitability is very positive in the short run, longer-term consequences of higher interest rates on bank profitability may well prove to be less benign, because the interest income on bank assets may rise more slowly than their funding costs.  The ECB recently abolished the remuneration paid to banks on minimum reserves, but there are proposals for an increase in the minimum reserve requirement ratio at euro area level to reduce liquidity in the system. What is your view on this?     In July, we had a comprehensive discussion on the minimum reserve requirements and their remuneration. We came to the conclusion that, from a monetary policy perspective, it would be appropriate to keep them at a level of 1% but to remunerate them at 0% instead of applying the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. Let me stress three points.  First, our main tool for adjusting our monetary stance is our policy rates and not minimum reserve requirements. Second, minimum reserve requirements are linked to the volume of deposits, which means that they mainly affect banks with high holdings of deposits rather than those with high holdings of excess liquidity. Therefore, they tend to put a larger burden on smaller banks. Also, these higher reserve requirements may lead to “avoidance strategies” by banks, which could remunerate deposits by even less or shift them to entities outside the euro area, where there are no minimum reserve requirements. Lastly, we are currently discussing the design of our future operational framework for monetary policy implementation. As long as we do not know the role that minimum reserve requirements will play in this new framework, we should be cautious about making any far-reaching decisions.  In any case, the reduction of excess liquidity through the shrinking of our balance sheet will continue for some time and, eventually, all our asset purchase programmes will go into full run-off.   Economic growth prospects have worsened quite substantially, with the possibility of recession not being excluded from forecasts. What is your understanding of the drivers and the consequences of this recent deterioration in the business climate?  Over recent months, we have seen that most economic indicators point to a slowing growth momentum. We first saw a pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector, which started to spread to the services sector as the reopening effects from the pandemic faded. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for manufacturing are in deeply contractionary territory, and those for services are also signalling contraction. Consumer confidence has increased notably over the past year but remains at low levels. All this is pointing to subdued economic developments over the rest of this year.  While a technical recession cannot be excluded, there are no indications of a deep or prolonged downturn. One reason is the labour market, which is still quite resilient, resulting in strong nominal wage growth. As inflation falls, real incomes are rising, which supports economic growth going forward. What is clear is that our monetary policy will continue to have a dampening effect on economic growth.  So, there is no reason for concern of a deeper recession setting in?    We see indications of a period of stagnation but not of a deep or prolonged recession.  Still, the state of the economy in Germany, as a country that is a very important export market for many EU Member States, is not encouraging. How justified are the claims that Germany is currently the “sick man of Europe”?   Germany is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. Its economy has been hit twice: by the energy price shock and by weaker growth in China. This has exposed structural weaknesses linked to the dependence on cheap energy and on a booming economy in China that was eager to buy German manufacturing products. On top of this, Germany faces challenges regarding demographic developments, as it has a rapidly ageing society implying an increasing scarcity of labour, as well as the green transition which, as in many other countries, is facing political obstacles. Cyclical factors, i.e. weak domestic and foreign demand, will eventually fade, but the structural factors may weigh on potential growth and hence have longer-term effects. All this implies that  Germany, as is the case with many other countries, will need to adjust its business model to the changing global conditions, as well as to its domestic challenges.  How likely do you think that is?  Germany has managed to transform itself in the past and I am confident that it will be able to do so today. Naturally, this requires strategic thinking and openness to change. In particular, the green transition offers Germany vast opportunities to regain its technological leadership. The economy will pick up eventually, but the main issue concerns long-term potential growth, and that depends very much on how Germany tackles its structural challenges.  Arguments that the global economy is generally entering a phase of weak growth and disinflation are gaining ground. What do you see as having the most impact on inflation looking ahead?  What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics. When input costs rose sharply, many firms raised their prices in excess of the cost increase. So we saw an increase in profits in many sectors, also due to temporary supply-demand imbalances caused by bottlenecks and reopening effects. As a result of rising prices, employees experienced a drop in real wages. Now employees are trying to regain lost purchasing power, and tight labour market conditions are making it easier for the unions to negotiate higher wage increases. It is through such second-round effects that inflation becomes more persistent. The weakening of the economy, which is partly due to monetary policy transmission, makes it harder for firms to pass through higher wage costs to prices, meaning they may need to absorb higher costs through their profit margins. We see indications that this is happening. How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation, particularly underlying inflation, will be going forward.   There is a major difference of opinion as to how corporate profit margins over the last period have spurred inflation growth, with some analyses pointing to the conclusion that they were totally irrelevant.  Inflation is not only the result of rising wages or higher energy prices. Profits have also increased quite a lot over recent years. Looking ahead, the question is by how much wages will increase and to what extent rising wage costs will be absorbed by profit margins. It is only natural to expect that the unions and employees will try to regain some of the lost purchasing power and that wages will grow. But it is crucial how firms respond, and that depends on demand conditions and hence on our monetary policy.  Fiscal policy is expected to be prudent and cautious in order to curb inflation. However, politicians have their own concerns, such as a decline in the living standards of their citizens and in investment. On account of its widening fiscal deficit, Italy is again in the spotlight, and so is an increase in its bond yields. How does one reconcile these opposing goals?  We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years, which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures. However, we have also learnt over the years that consolidation should not come at the expense of necessary public investments. What really matters is the composition of public spending, which should aim to make the economy more productive and to strengthen the supply capacity. This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term. Therefore, it would be unwise to postpone public investments and structural reforms that are necessary to transform the economy. This is where the European funds come into play. The Next Generation EU programme can help countries to continue investing in their future. At the same time, the perception that the government can counter every economic shock through fiscal transfers is dangerous and could lead to unsustainable fiscal dynamics.    When it comes to recent yield movements in global financial markets, the largest part is driven by a general repricing of longer-term rates, as markets are anticipating interest rates to be held at a high level over a longer period of time. These higher funding costs imply that governments need to be even more prudent.  The ECB’s position that the price of borrowing will remain high for as long as necessary to reach the target inflation rate has been communicated quite clearly. Nevertheless, is there anything else that can be said in that context?     Our policy is data dependent, which implies that the level and duration of restrictive rates will depend on how the data develop. What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner. That is then also embedded in inflation expectations. One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly “anchored” around our target, in spite of painfully high inflation rates. Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.\n",
      "Content 17: INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold 2 October 2023  It’s been two weeks since the ECB raised rates for the tenth consecutive time, have you now done enough to tame inflation?  Let me stress an issue, which is sometimes slightly overlooked but is a very important part of the discussion, namely the transmission of monetary policy. That's crucial in order to understand the decisions that we have taken and those that we will take. In transmission you have two different legs. The first one is from our monetary policy decisions to financial markets and banks. In that first stage, the transmission is almost complete. You can see it. In the banking channel, there has been a tightening of financing conditions following our decisions. And there has been a significant drop in the demand for credit.  The second phase is how the impact of the tightening of financing conditions feeds through to the real economy. And here there is much more uncertainty. We have seen a slowdown in economic activity. But there are other factors behind that, for instance the impact of inflation on households’ disposable income and the evolution of exports, which is related to the slowdown in the global economy. The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy, and indirectly to inflation. That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates, if maintained over time, will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.   Do you worry about the risks of overdoing the tightening of monetary policy and driving the economy into an unnecessarily painful recession?   We do not at all want to create an unnecessarily painful recession. We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy. This is, at the end of the day, a very delicate balance. If the transmission is incomplete, then we should be a little more patient. If the transmission is much closer to completion, then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.   Does the recent rise in oil and gas prices, coupled with a weaker euro, make your task more difficult?   Yes, it makes our task more difficult. I would not say that it is a game changer. But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.   What would it take for the ECB to start cutting rates?   Well, we are not there.   But what would you need to see?   First of all, progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability, i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way. Starting to talk about rate cuts now is premature. We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Still, I think the last stretch is going to be more difficult. We are on our way towards 2 per cent. That’s clear. But we must monitor that very closely, as the last mile will not be easy.   But would the last mile be the hardest to achieve in bringing inflation down?  First let’s look at the factors in favour of disinflation. Base effects have an impact. Supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away. And there is monetary policy and the clear slowdown in the economy. In the second half of the year the economy in the euro area will have stagnated.  Now let’s turn to factors against disinflation. There’s a spike in oil prices. Wages are growing about 5 per cent on average. Demand for services is high, even though we have started to see a clear slowdown. And the euro has depreciated.  So, when you put all this in the balance, our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months. But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.   Are governments making inflation worse by continuing to run big deficits?   The first factor with respect to fiscal policy is the withdrawal of the subsidies granted over the last two years, which must be completed before the end of 2023. But it’s not only that. There is also the fiscal stance, which sometimes gets overlooked. My impression is that after four years without EU fiscal rules, governments may have got used to a little bit of a “whatever it takes” approach with respect to fiscal policy. But that has to change. Having a tightening of monetary policy and, simultaneously, an expansionary fiscal policy would be a very bad policy mix. And being more concrete, what would be detrimental is a fiscal deficit that goes above the level of 2022.   Does the ECB need to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system?   We are doing that. And this is totally normal in the process of normalisation of monetary policy. That is the correct pace, the correct path. TLTRO reached €2.1 trillion and now we are a little bit below €500 billion. And over the next year it will become close to zero.  What about stopping reinvestments in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme?  Some of my colleagues in the Governing Council have been quite outspoken with respect to the need for starting the process of quantitative tightening on the PEPP. But in the formal structure of the Council, we have not even started the discussion. It will arrive sooner or later.  Do you still need the flexibility of PEPP reinvestments as the first line of defence against financial market fragmentation, despite not having used it for two years?  If you ask the military, they will tell you that extra lines of defence are always good. Yes, we could use flexibility in the reimbursement of the PEPP to address fragmentation. It has not been used for two years because spreads are quiet. The PEPP is less than €2 trillion. Therefore, even doing a full run-off, the withdrawal of liquidity will not be huge. It is the first line of defence in times of volatility in markets, but that is not the case now. So, we’ll have to analyse it.  How about the banking system? Do you expect an increase in non-performing loans?  Return on European banks’ equity has clearly improved because of the widening of net interest margins after the increase in interest rates and it is now above 10%. Two years ago, it was around 4%. But banks’ valuations have not moved in parallel. Why? I think that the main reason is because the cost of equity of the European banks has increased quite a lot and it’s close to 15%. When interest rates increase, the cost of equity also goes up. Markets are also pricing in that the improvement in profitability will not be sustainable over time because they are factoring in an economic slowdown. And they price in that banks will have to increase provisions should non-performing loans levels go up.  This means profitability will be dented in the future. The current figures are a sort of illusion. In the pipeline, we start to see that the quality of the assets is deteriorating, and there’s an increase in non-performing loans. On top of that, taxes on bank profits have created some uncertainty.   Should countries not introduce bank taxes?   Not all bank taxes are identical. You have seen that in the case of Italy. The final proposal is much more sensible than the first one. Our point is very clear: these taxes should not impair credit and should not create any limitation in the capitalisation of European banks. This applies as well in terms of the banks being prudent in dividend payments and share buybacks, and even the remuneration of bankers.  Some members of the Governing Council would like to increase the minimum reserve requirements for the banks, on which you pay no interest. What do you think of that?  My opinion is that we should conduct monetary policy based on price stability, not on the profit and loss of national central banks. To reach price stability, you have to reduce liquidity. The reduction of liquidity will give rise to a reduction of these windfall profits that the commercial banks are getting at the moment because of increasing interest rates.   Are there any signs of distress in the property sector?   In commercial property there has been a very important decline in prices, mainly in some Nordic countries. The main problems have appeared in Sweden, Finland, the Nordic countries. But it’s quite pervasive. Residential real estate is more resilient. But, for instance, in the case of Germany, it was not a total surprise to see the recent data showing that house prices have declined by almost 10%. That’s a clear indication that there were some pockets of overvaluation that are going to be corrected. Our concern now are the non-banks, the property and mutual funds, that have a big exposure to real estate. I would say that commercial property – even though we also need to pay attention to residential property – is our main source of concern in terms of financial stability.\n",
      "Content 18: INTERVIEW  Interview with Market News International    Interview with Frank Elderson,  of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 22 September 2023  27 September 2023  Your speech at   Terschelling   was something of a departure for a central banker, in that it was clearly very personal, while at the same time seeking to counter a certain pessimism regarding attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Are you concerned that there isn’t sufficient buy-in at the moment from, as you put it, “those who pollute, those who finance the polluters, and those who supervise the financiers of the polluters”?  Looking back at the past five years, there are many things that clearly show we are not transitioning to a zero-emission economy fast enough, with all the problems that brings economically. On the other hand, many other things are going in the right direction. My main message was that we can do this, but we need to be fast. The later the transition, the higher the cost, as our recent economy-wide climate stress test has shown. So I might have used a little more pathos than I would have done if speaking here in Frankfurt, but the message is just as clear.  Is the ECB doing enough?   As supervisors we have a multi-year strategy. We published our expectations for climate-related and environmental risks in 2020. In 2021 we asked the banks to conduct self-assessments of where they stood vis-à-vis these expectations. On the basis of what we saw a year ago, the glass is slowly filling up, but it is not yet half full and it needs to be full by the end of 2024. I do see progress – banks are now better equipped to manage climate-related and environmental risks than when we made our initial assessments. Each of our expectations has been met at least once by a bank we supervise. The glass is filling up – but it is not yet full. Building on what the banks themselves found reasonable, we set a series of interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year, the second at the end of 2023 and the last – by which banks need to satisfy all our expectations – at the end of 2024. And we have said that we will use all our instruments to enforce these deadlines if needed.  Banks understand that we mean what we say and that this is within our mandate, because climate-related and environmental risks translate into financial risks which must be managed by the banks. This is also acknowledged worldwide. Although you do still see differences in how fast and how ambitious supervisors are, the fact of these risks being within their mandate is no longer controversial. That is a real step forward, and one which also reflects the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example.  But in that speech and others you’ve highlighted the urgency that’s required. Is that compatible with what is arguably still a very gradualist approach aimed, essentially, at trying to bring banks along with you, rather than you saying “you absolutely have to do this now, and if you don’t there will be consequences”?  First of all, ask the bankers. I don’t think that they would say that this is extremely gradual – many banks probably feel that we are pursuing this rather enthusiastically. There are clear deadlines − also interim deadlines − and we will enforce them if necessary. To be very clear, that includes periodic penalty payments. That’s not a step we take lightly, so I think that this shows how serious we are when we issue supervisory expectations. Do I particularly like that? Well, I believe it’s better to convince the banks. I know we’re asking a lot, and some banks would say it’s very difficult and claim that they can’t really do anything because they lack the data. But it is also true that the risks don’t become smaller just because they are difficult to measure. There is still a lot you can do short of perfection. But the risks are out there, and they will not wait until 2030 or 2050 to materialise – so we need to make real progress. Patchy data are better than no data at all. The same is true of the emerging art of climate modelling. Patchy climate models are better than nothing, but if you don’t even identify the gaps, you cannot really make progress towards filling them. There are many other things banks can do besides climate modelling, and we have also published a guide of best practices for banks that sets out these numerous options.  So looking at it from other directions, is there anything more that the ECB could, or should, be doing beyond compliance, such as making green investment more attractive? Might we one day see the green TLTROs (targeted longer-term refinancing operations) that commentators were discussing not so long ago?  Whereas up to now we’ve been speaking about what we are doing in our banking supervision, you are now asking a question about what we might consider in our monetary policy. Talking about possible future instruments is of course highly speculative, because whenever we design an instrument, we take into consideration all the circumstances of that particular moment. Any instrument needs to be effective to pursue our primary mandate of price stability, and it needs to be proportionate. It also depends on the environment – whether we are in a period of policy tightening or accommodation. But climate considerations are clearly part of the monetary policy strategy we adopted in 2021. I think it’s fair to assume that we will take climate considerations into account in the features of any type of instrument we may design in future − including any purchase programme.  In your speech you also mentioned the extent to which national governments subsidise fossil fuel industries. Obviously, there are limits to the ECB’s mandate, and maybe this is pushing those limits. But insofar as this issue constitutes a financial stability risk, can the ECB play a greater role? Or should it be left to private citizens to pursue the issue through the courts?  You’re talking to a lawyer, and the overriding requirement through all of this is that we act within our mandate. And when I talk to banks, I point out that we are seeing exponential growth in climate-related litigation. From our perspective, banks need to manage that risk at a time when there are certain cases in which the courts have endorsed rather far-reaching legal theories, including against states. It can no longer be taken for granted that those judgments will not be repeated or set a precedent, and that is something banks should be acutely aware of.  You said recently that there will be a just transition or no transition. Could you unpack that a little?  What I wanted to say there is that, if you look at what is happening in the world, it is clear that there is a risk of a growing antagonism – that the energy transition and climate crisis become politicised. All EU Member States have committed to becoming Paris Agreement-aligned. Not delivering on that, or postponing the transition, will lead to an economically suboptimal situation where the transition ends up being more costly. Our own analysis has also shown this time and again. Bringing attention to this issue is within our mandate.  If we could turn to monetary policy – In your last Governing Council meeting, the ECB raised interest rates again. For the final time in the cycle?  We have said it very clearly: we consider that, with the decisions we’ve made and on the basis of our current assessment, the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term. Does that mean policy rates have peaked? Not necessarily. There is still a lot of uncertainty. That’s why we take these decisions meeting by meeting, on a data-dependent basis. Making any predictions about what we will do next would not be consistent with that approach.  How do you see the balance of risks to the inflation outlook? Is it simply that the latest hike puts the ECB on a sounder footing by guarding against any additional upward price pressures?  I think that’s exactly what it is. Of course, there are upward risks to inflation. There could, for example, be upward pressures on food and energy prices – since July we have been alluding in our monetary policy statement to the importance of weather and climate conditions in this respect. Climate change could also lead to a shift in longer-term inflation dynamics, but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation. Helpful distinctions have also been proposed by my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Isabel Schnabel, analysing the impact of climate change itself, the ongoing dependency on fossil fuels and the green transition. Some aspects are certainly inflationary – 2022’s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67% compared with the year before, for example, so that’s rather significant. But it could also be the case that, over much longer horizons and depending on how the transition goes, energy will become much more abundant and cheaper.  Do you see any evidence that the current interest rate environment is having a negative effect on green investment?  Any interest rate decision has an effect on investment, both green and non-green. In the end, I think the best we can do is make sure that we deliver on our price stability mandate. That will create the stable environment in which the transition – including the required investment, which needs to be sped up – can take place.  How concerned are you about the growth outlook for the euro area? Or does the primary mandate of price stability ultimately matter more?  What we’re seeing is a more protracted period of sluggish growth than we were expecting. Of course, we need to look at the various explanatory factors, such as lower demand for euro area exports, the impact of tighter financing conditions, lower residential and business investment, and the weakening services sector. On the other hand, labour markets are still strong and disposable income is expected to rise, which would have a stabilising effect on overall GDP growth. It’s also true that our primary mandate is to deliver price stability, and I think we have proven we are very determined to do that, as seen in the ten rate hikes that we’ve decided on since July 2022.  So would you consider cutting rates if growth were to surprise significantly to the downside in the coming months?  I think I’ve explained very clearly how we take our decisions. We take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and we look at all the incoming data. We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments, and we will weigh any incoming data carefully, as always, in relation to our inflation outlook.  Would you need to see inflation clearly and consistently trending below 2% over the course of your medium-term projections before considering a cut appropriate? Equally, would reinvestments need to have stopped by that time?  Let me stick to what I have just said. As you know, we stand ready to adjust all our instruments as needed. Based on today’s assessments, we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target. We will keep rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.\n",
      "Content 19: INTERVIEW  Interview with Yahoo Finance   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Jennifer Schonberger  22 September 2023  You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?  Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.  So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?  So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.  So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?  Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.  As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?  I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.  You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?  Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.  Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?  This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.\n",
      "Content 20: INTERVIEW  Interview with The Currency   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Stephen Kinsella on 31 August 2023 5 September 2023  Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?  We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.  In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?  Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.  Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.  Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.  I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?  I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing. This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.  I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.  I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?  Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.  Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.  I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?  Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.  Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.  Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?  I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.  I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?  The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.  Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?  Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.  Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?  We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.  We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic!  For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?\n"

      "Content 1: INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 2 February 2024 7 February 2024  Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.\n",
      "Content 2: INTERVIEW  Interview with De Volkskrant   Interview with Frank Elderson,  of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Jonathan Witteman on 29 January 2024 3 February 2024  In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.\n",
      "Content 3: INTERVIEW  Interview with Die Zeit   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Kolja Rudzio 31 January 2024  Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!\n",
      "Content 4: CONTRIBUTION  Thanks to Wolfgang Schäuble   Contribution by Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB, French and German members of parliament and other personalities, published on n-tv.de Frankfurt am Main, 22 January 2024 A Franco-German homage and appeal  As a young member of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble founded the Baden-Alsace discussion group together with the Mayor of Colmar, Joseph Rey. In his last ever campaign appearances, he supported pro-European parliamentary candidates in Alsace and Lorraine. Born during the war, raised in the French occupation zone, elected in the border region of southern Baden, friendship with France was close to his heart throughout his life – as the foundation for a strong Europe.  As a minister, Wolfgang Schäuble worked in close contact with his French counterparts. He was the first German finance minister to participate in a meeting of the French cabinet at the Élysée Palace. He formulated the aspiration to always take French and European interests into account: “If a solution is good for Europe, then it is good for Germany. And if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany”. German unity and European integration, open borders and joint security, a strong euro as a guarantee of stability – these fundamental convictions shaped his actions.  As President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, together with the then President of the French National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, spearheaded the establishment of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on 25 March 2019 in Paris; this joint chamber, comprising 50 German and 50 French members of parliament, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both Presidents had previously signed the Franco-German Parliamentary Accord, which – some 56 years after the Élysée Treaty – adds a parliamentary dimension to the Franco-German friendship as an intergovernmental agreement, thus raising it to a completely new level. None of this would have been possible without Wolfgang Schäuble’s impassioned efforts alongside his colleague in Paris.  Even in his last interview – published on 24 December 2023, just two days before he passed away – Wolfgang Schäuble called for reviving the Weimar Triangle as a “German-Polish-French engine for Europe” and strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities: “Let’s follow this European path. Only by working together can Europe play an economic, military and environmental role in the world.“  That is his legacy. And that is why the state memorial ceremony in his honour is quite rightly taking place on 22 January, “Franco-German Day” – exactly 61 years after the signing of the Élysée Treaty and six years to the day since Wolfgang Schäuble became the first President of the Bundestag to address the French National Assembly on 22 January 2018. In that speech he described the Franco-German friendship as \"a gift from history\", but one owed to the vision of courageous people who, after the world wars and the crimes committed by Germany, showed the way to reconciliation. Wolfgang Schäuble said: “What has been achieved inspires us to move forward” and added “Let us use the freedom we enjoy today. Let us live up to our responsibilities as courageously as the original signatories. Together! ”  Wolfgang Schäuble more than lived up to these responsibilities, and did so honestly and tirelessly. Yet the state memorial ceremony in the German Bundestag with Emmanuel Macron is more than just a tribute to great merit. It is a mission and an appeal. It is a mission entrusted to us, as leaders in politics and society, to bring the European vision to life in a spirit of close partnership. And it is an appeal to young people to keep enthusiastically pursuing the idea of Europe. Peace, freedom and friendship cannot be taken for granted, we have to work for them again and again. As for European integration, it is far from complete and must continue to be shaped, with determination – and by those who are truly European at heart, as was Wolfgang Schäuble.  We will honour Wolfgang Schäuble's memory with immense gratitude for his life's work. We pay tribute to a great German, a great friend of France and a great European. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Wolfgang Schäuble.\n",
      "Content 5: INTERVIEW  Interview with Corriere della Sera   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Federico Fubini 13 January 2024    The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?  The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.  Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.  The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.   What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?  The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.  Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.   Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?  Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.   The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?  I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.  It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.  Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?  For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.  Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?  The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.   Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?  For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.  Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?   We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.   There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?  Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.  Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?  That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.  EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?   A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.  Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?  We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.  Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?  It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.\n",
      "Content 6: INTERVIEW  Q&A on X   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted and published on 10 January 2024 10 January 2024 Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% inflation is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: \"central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s\". Yet, we have seen how inflation has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the \"normal mechanism\" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of \"austrian\" or \"hard-money\" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As inflation falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about inflation reacceleration or does the link between Growth/Inflation (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Inflation has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on inflation in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee inflation reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to inflation as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling inflation raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying inflation are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that inflation is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and inflation. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly disinflationary before the pandemic and inflationary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of inflationary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our inflation target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average inflation after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act inflation after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average inflation?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, inflation will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term inflation and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or inflation.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and inflation is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core inflation above 2% for the entire year. At which level inflation would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that inflation sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the disinflationary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate inflation BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see inflation returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect inflation to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Does the ECB take into account the asymmetries that are produced from its policies due to the fact that the EZ is not a proper monetary union? Do you think it should/shouldn't? Thank you   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further steps in European integration would clearly benefit our single monetary policy. Therefore we need to make further progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union. #AskECB    @ecb   Why would any Country give up their sovereign currency knowing that money can be printed instead of borrowed ? The US,UK,Can... have retained their sovereignty, they are in a better situation to react to \"shocks\" in the economy. natural or man made.   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro area countries have decided to give up their own currencies and join the euro. A currency union reduces transaction costs and facilitates trade by removing exchange rate risks. The euro enjoys wide support in all member countries. #AskECB   Also, how far can BVB go in the Champions League this season?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: All the way! #AskECB  Time to wrap up for today.

      "Content 7: INTERVIEW  Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit   Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit by Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB  3 January 2024 When I think of Wolfgang Schäuble, the first image I see is him sitting across from me at the table of the French cabinet in the Élysée Palace, the first German finance minister to participate in such a meeting. I see him sitting at the negotiating table in Brussels, at one of our many meetings that ran long into the night. I hear the straight talker who never shied away from difficult decisions. I remember the dedicated public servant, a master of diplomacy with the intellectual ability to understand opposing viewpoints. I see a natural statesman with the courage to stand by his convictions as well as the pragmatism to recognise the world as it is. And I see a man of loyalty and kindness.  The recent passing of my dear friend and colleague saddens me deeply, and my heart goes out to his family. Yet I take comfort in remembering his remarkable achievements for Europe. I recall his own words in this regard because they capture his clear commitment to both Germany and Europe: “If a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.” Few have done as much for Germany and Europe over such a long period as Wolfgang, with his more than half a century of public service. As minister of the interior, he was at the heart of Germany’s reunification process. It was a moment of profound change for the country and for all Europeans, and one that had to be handled with great care in view of the sensitivities of neighbouring countries to German history. Wolfgang understood that one of the best ways for Germany to demonstrate its responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours. That was no small matter in a nation so proud of the Deutsche Mark. But he knew that a single currency would bind Europe together and protect the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations, and that this was in Germany’s and in Europe’s best interests. When Europe’s sovereign debt crisis came, Wolfgang was a calming influence, reminding us that the euro is much more than just a currency. His defence of Europe was unwavering and absolute. Nevertheless, he was always self-reflective, and later asked himself how things could have been done differently, potentially causing less suffering. Wolfgang’s intellectual rigour stemmed from his ability to combine the subtlety of a diplomat with the attention to detail of a lawyer. It was a quality that put him at the forefront of discussions in the 1990s on how to build a more deeply integrated European framework.  His statesmanship would have been welcome in today’s challenging environment of extreme views. His success did not come through a forceful personality, but from understanding how to find common ground with others. This approach has served Germany and Europe well. In my experience, Wolfgang’s philosophy was consistent: stay true to yourself and to your democratic institutions. Now is a timely moment to remember that as we remember him. I will miss my dear friend, and the birthday flowers he sent me over many years!\n",
      "Content 8: INTERVIEW  Interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Meike Schreiber und Markus Zydra on 18 December 2023 22 December 2023    Inflation has recently fallen to 2.4%, more rapidly than expected. Are you satisfied?    We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2%. We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term, as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire, such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services. We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2% by 2025.  So, we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.   But you do want to go the last mile?  We must go the last mile: we have an inflation target of 2%.   Would 2.1% not be enough?  We want to return to 2% on a sustainable basis.   There is war in Ukraine and Gaza. How much do global crises influence the central bank’s work?   Geopolitical shocks lead to uncertainty and thereby affect economic decisions. At the same time, they can also push up energy prices and hit world trade by disrupting supply chains – which we see happening in the Red Sea right now. Geopolitics can also influence the green transition, if the supply of commodities, such as those required for producing solar cells or batteries, is restricted for political ends. All of this affects our core business: the fight against inflation.   Your policy rate decisions are data-dependent, as you always emphasise. How useful are historical data to you when, as at present, the global situation is constantly changing fundamentally?  Historical data are valuable as one can derive patterns from them. But the world can change very quickly. We then need to adjust our analyses, without discarding historical knowledge. The macroeconomic environment has indeed changed radically over the past few years. We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then – owing to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine – quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation. Looking at the period of low interest rates would hardly help. But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.   Inflation was very low in the past decades. Was that mainly because of the central banks’ sound monetary policy? Or was it partly luck, thanks to globalisation for example?   It was both. After the great inflation of the 1970s, monetary policy changed fundamentally. Central banks have become more independent and have a clearer mandate: price stability. This has increased the credibility of monetary policy. But there have also been macroeconomic trends, particularly globalisation and China’s entry into the world market, which played an important role and brought down inflation.  Has the fight for stable prices got tougher?   Since 2020 there have been several severe external shocks. That makes monetary policy more challenging.   Will inflation be higher in future than it was before?   Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2%. At the same time, we may be confronted with more supply-side shocks. And these could turn out to be inflationary, even though that is hard to predict. Climate change, for example, drives prices, we see that already. Extreme weather can push up food prices, low water levels in the Panama Canal increase transportation costs, and carbon taxes raise the price of fossil fuels. A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well. But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence, which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.   When you joined the Executive Board in 2020 you wanted to smooth the fractious relationship between Germans and the ECB. Did you manage to do so?   The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB. It has enabled us to strengthen the ECB’s credibility.   But the ECB was too slow in combating inflation. Many people haven’t forgotten that.     We acted relatively late, but all the more decisively. We sharply increased interest rates within a short time, and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation. Inflation was initially caused by rising energy prices and disrupted supply chains owing to the pandemic and the war. These constrained aggregate supply, while demand remained robust. Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations. We succeeded in doing that. It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2%.   Inflation has fallen, but the higher prices continue to put pressure on people.  The prices are clearly higher than before the pandemic, and monetary policy cannot roll back that increase. And people would not be better off if we plunged the economy into years of deep recession just to bring the prices back to their old levels.  Would you manage, though?  With massive consequences, but this is not the task of monetary policy. An energy price shock makes an economy that is reliant on energy imports poorer overall. Somebody has to bear those losses.  When you have achieved your 2% inflation target, is there a risk of forgetting that the high level of prices is as good as entrenched now?  We target inflation, not the price level. Also in the past, it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.  The quick and sharp interest rate hikes have led to banks suddenly making record profits. Is this fair?  Our decisions are guided by our price stability mandate. But they have side effects, including their impact on bank profits. Banks have lent money at higher rates, but they have not passed the higher interest rates on to their depositors immediately or in full. But we expect banks’ profits to be under more pressure in the future because banks will face higher funding costs and rising credit default risks, while lending is weakening. Banks would therefore be well-advised to use these short-term profits to build up a buffer against future losses.  But banks tend not to do that, opting to pay out dividends instead. Erring on the side of caution would certainly not hurt the banks.  The high profits are also boosted by the 4% deposit facility rate which banks receive on their excess reserves. The ECB could shrink these deposits by raising the minimum reserve requirement. Why has it not done so?  In July we decided to no longer remunerate the minimum reserves while keeping the minimum reserve requirement at 1% of the minimum reserve base, which consists mainly of customer deposits. The minimum reserve requirement is not an effective way of compensating the remuneration of excess liquidity. Large banks have the highest excess liquidity, smaller banks have less. At the same time, the smaller banks are mostly funded by deposits. This is why they would be disproportionally affected by higher minimum reserve requirements.  By the same token, large banks are subsidised with the deposit rate, because many smaller lenders only have low excess amounts that are remunerated.  Banks are not subsidised. But the effects of our measures do vary. For example, during the pandemic the ECB granted longer-term loans that have strongly benefited smaller banks. At the same time, until recently banks were charged a negative interest for their excess liquidity, and that affected large banks more. There are no banks that are systematically at an advantage or a disadvantage. All banks are important for the transmission of monetary policy.  The ECB could sell all the sovereign bonds – that would solve the excess reserve problem. The ECB’s balance sheet has already shrunk significantly. This will continue in the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity. But the primary monetary policy instrument is ECB policy rates. The reduction of our balance sheet is happening gradually in the background, also to avoid market turbulence. While we are not expecting any, we are not taking any risks.  The ECB is making losses now because it has to pay high interest to banks while holding low-yielding bonds. A central bank that is making losses doesn’t look too good.  Our bond purchases were always guided by monetary policy considerations. Take the pandemic emergency purchase programme. This measure probably averted a serious financial crisis that would have wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s lives. The ECB’s losses cannot be viewed out of context.  But they do damage your reputation.  We always assess whether our measures are proportionate, and losses can damage the central bank’s credibility and independence. In the future, this might lead to a certain reassessment of bond purchases.  How do you assess the ECB’s bond purchases?  Bond purchases can be employed for achieving two distinct goals: price stability on the one hand, and market stabilisation on the other. They were very successful in stabilising the financial markets. But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation. At the time, one problem was the very restrictive fiscal policy. Governments failed to make use of the low interest rate period to invest, and this made life difficult for monetary policy.  The lesson here is that fiscal and monetary policy need to pull together.  When you joined the ECB in 2020, inflation was low, the key interest rate below zero and central banks were making profits. This has all changed. How has it affected you?  I have learnt that the world can change much more quickly than you think. The central bank needs to react swiftly in such situations, and this is a challenge. But I think that we have done pretty well in the past four years.\n",
      "Content 9: INTERVIEW  Interview with 20 Minutos   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Emilio Ordiz and Jorge Millán 21 December 2023  Wage cost data in Spain point to an increase of 4.7%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that domestic inflation is resisting and is largely predicated by wages. Do you think wage moderation is required to beat inflation?  A year ago inflation was above 10% and now it is below 3%. Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable, i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation, basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade, and because monetary policy is taking effect. However, average wage growth in the euro area is over 5%, whereas productivity is barely improving. This means that unit labour costs are rising, which adds to inflationary pressures. In 2022 profit margins increased considerably, but this year the increase has been more moderate. This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs, which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.   What will the ECB do in this situation?  We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins, as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2% target. We are keeping a very close eye on this.  The EU is emerging from this crisis better than it did in 2008. What do you think has changed?  We have the experience of what happened in 2008 and the two crises are completely different. The 2008 crisis broke out on the back of extremely high private sector debt levels, which had a significant impact on the banking sector. The response was also very different. For the crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic, there have been no limits to fiscal policy, and this has been accompanied by monetary policy that has also been very expansive. In addition to this, the European Union came up with an action plan for all countries throughout the bloc, providing them with funding through the Next Generation EU programme.  However, the situation has now changed. Almost all income indicators have returned to their pre-pandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation. To this end, the ECB takes action through its monetary policy but we also need to see fiscal policy return to normal.   With euro area inflation at 2.4% in November and euro area GDP stagnating for the past twelve months, how do you explain to people why interest rates are being kept so high?   Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do, which is bring inflation down. Monetary policy operates by tightening financing conditions: higher interest rates affect levels of economic activity. And when economic activity is dampened, inflation slows. Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2%, monetary policy might then start to ease. But it’s still too early for that to happen.   When can we expect to see the first interest rate cuts?   If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time, current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2%. We are data dependent. The data have been favourable but still not enough for us to change our monetary policy. It’s therefore too early to talk about a cut in interest rates.  What do you think about opinions from certain quarters that the ECB is sort of following in the slipstream of the US Federal Reserve?  The US economy’s fundamentals and cycles differ from Europe’s. US fiscal policy has been much more expansive, growth is higher and the rate of unemployment, below 4%, is even lower than in the euro area. With an unemployment rate of 6.5%, our labour market is in good shape, but on the whole the economies are in different situations. As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, what the Federal Reserve does is relevant, but it does not determine the ECB’s monetary decisions.  Do you think that now is the time for completing banking union? This debate always seems to be ongoing but never seems to reach a conclusion.  Completing the banking union is essential if we want full economic and monetary union in Europe. There is one pillar missing: a European deposit insurance scheme. European elections will be held in June 2024, offering another opportunity for this. Completing banking union should be on the future European Commission’s agenda, as should making progress on a fiscal union through the introduction of a common fiscal stabilisation function.  Do you think there is the risk of a recession if, for example, the war in Ukraine drags on?   The ECB does not expect a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But beyond whether or not a recession will occur, the main issue is that Europe’s economy has a structural growth problem. Both our projections and those of the European Commission see very moderate growth of around 1% up until 2026. These potential growth levels are low because productivity is barely improving. Europe needs to import more energy than other global economies. As a result, the energy crisis further exacerbates its competitiveness issues. Structural reforms are therefore necessary. The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, but to achieve growth, other factors must be brought into play.  What would these reforms have to be?  One would be completing banking union, as I mentioned. Clear progress also needs to be made towards the capital markets union, and also in the single market of the European Union. Not much is said about the latter, but we are in a situation where there are hardly any limits on state aid, which creates imbalances between countries, depending on their fiscal position. The focus basically needs to be on Europe's low growth potential, how to increase productivity and the reforms needed to boost growth in the medium term.  Do you think it would be feasible to standardise the formula for the European Union’s Next Generation funds?  The Next Generation funds were a response to the pandemic and had two very positive aspects: the issuance of joint debt and the fact that part of the aid consisted of grants rather than loans. Beyond the clearly positive effects of the programme, it ultimately highlights that we need to complete our economic and monetary union. And to do so it is vital to have a permanent centralised fiscal policy instrument, and to implement structural reforms.  Staying with the European Union, there was an agreement on fiscal rules yesterday. How does the ECB see it?   Markets are calm and interest rates on sovereign debt have even fallen. But this can change relatively quickly in the context of low growth, tight monetary policy and geopolitical risks. That is why it is very important to have a clear framework of common fiscal rules. We welcome that there's an agreement because that reduces uncertainty in the markets.  And what is the ECB calling for?  Our recommendation is that the framework should be simple, transparent, easy to understand and countercyclical. In other words, it should allow fiscal policy to be expansionary in bad times and contractionary in good times. Fiscal action plans need to ensure a prudent and sustained reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in structural deficits. They should also create fiscal space for public investment in digitalisation, climate change or defence, and should provide incentives for structural reforms.  In the end, would you say that the EU has completely ditched austerity?  Sometimes it is not clear what is meant by “austerity”. Fiscal sustainability is essential, and, at the same time, fiscal rules have to allow for countercyclical action. And to be able to increase the public deficit during an economic downturn, countries need to rebuild their fiscal positions and reduce their public deficit when the going is good. Beyond fiscal policy, one basic difference between the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis was the very different monetary policy response, providing liquidity to banks and launching a pandemic asset purchase programme that has ultimately provided immense support to the European economy.  Do you think southern European countries have learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis?  Banking systems are much healthier than they were in the period from 2008 to 2011. And that is a key change. Moreover, these countries have made efforts to become more competitive and have a balance of payments surplus. For example, Greece and Portugal have made very significant budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in the risk premia and the ratings agencies. Many southern European countries have made considerable efforts to improve the sustainability of their public finances in the medium term. That is why it makes no sense to now try to create some kind of north-south divide between EU countries.   One of the most important projects the ECB is currently working on is a digital euro. How is it going and what are its key components?  At the moment, we all have euro banknotes in our wallets. A digital euro would be exactly the same, just on our mobiles. It would basically be the banknotes we have now, but in digital form and also backed by the central bank. We want it to be an additional, alternative means of payment. It is not meant to replace banknotes but to complement them. There would also be a limit on the amount of digital euro you can hold. In other words, it would be a means of payment but not a means of saving. We want a digital euro to be more comparable to banknotes than current accounts.  Do you share the Government’s optimism about the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy has a healthy banking system, which is completely different to how the situation was in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the economy is competitive, with a surplus in the balance of payments. It is important that both are maintained in the future. The external sector, including international tourism, has helped a lot in restoring income to pre-pandemic levels.   Are there any challenges?  Education still needs some work. This affects medium- and long-term growth because there are mismatches between labour supply and demand. The 12% unemployment rate means there is room for improvement in the labour market. Like some other euro area countries, Spain has a high public debt-to-GDP ratio of 110%. It is therefore important that these countries implement a prudent adjustment programme to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP.  All countries are going to face major challenges: economic slowdown, geopolitical risks, a new framework of fiscal rules or higher interest rates. That is why economic policy must be predictable.  The last two questions have a Spanish context. What do you think about Nadia Calviño’s appointment as the next president of the European Investment Bank?   Naturally, as a Spaniard, I think it is positive that Spaniards hold key positions in the European Union. I wish her and the institution all the very best.   And in the same vein, particularly seeing as you have held the post that Calviño now leaves, who would you like to see occupy the position left vacant by her?  It is not my place to comment on domestic affairs. I am sure whoever is appointed will be competent and I wish them every success.\n",
      "Content 10: INTERVIEW  Interview with Reuters   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Balázs Korányi on 1 December 2023 5 December 2023  What is your take on the unexpectedly benign November inflation reading? Does the recent string of downside surprises change your view about the inflation trajectory?  “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” I’m sure you know this famous quote that is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly. This was due to the reversal of the previous supply side shocks and was mainly driven by energy and food prices. Base effects played a significant role. The November flash release was a very pleasant surprise. Most importantly, underlying inflation, which has proven more stubborn, is now also falling more quickly than we had expected. This is quite remarkable. All in all, inflation developments have been encouraging. That said, despite these positive developments, I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely. We continue to expect an uptick over the coming months. There’s going to be a reversal of some fiscal measures and of some base effects, and we cannot exclude that there’s going to be a new price spike in energy or food. Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2% target. Our monetary policy is working. The restrictive policy is contributing to dampening growth in aggregate demand. Economic growth has been weak over the past several quarters, and it’s expected to remain weak this quarter before gradually picking up next year. This period of below-potential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2%. So, I believe we are on track, but we need to remain vigilant.  Are we still on the inflation path you outlined in your September projections?  Let’s see what our December staff projections are going to show. But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2% no later than 2025. This is our main objective.  What is your assessment of growth since the September projections?   Some of the hard data we see are not very good. But some of the soft data are giving us hope. The purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) seem to be bottoming out and they’re even showing a small uptick. Of course, this is from very low levels. But it is in line with our projections. Growth is then expected to pick up gradually next year, mainly due to rising real incomes, which should foster confidence and consumption. All this will depend, to a large extent, on the development of the labour market, which has been very resilient. We have seen that firms have held on to their labour force in spite of weakening economic growth. This is only sustainable if they expect growth to pick up. If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market, this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process. But while we do see some softening in the labour market, we do not expect a significant deterioration or a deep and prolonged recession.  Do you see a risk that the rapid drop in credit demand could exacerbate the downturn?  What we’re seeing is that monetary policy transmission is working. There has been a sharp increase in lending rates and a strong slowdown in loan growth. This is exactly what we wanted to see.  Markets are pricing an early spring rate cut but the ECB has guided for steady rates for several quarters. How do you view this discrepancy?  Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year. Central banks are more cautious, and I would argue they have to be more cautious. After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution. If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a sustainable manner. This should happen no later than 2025.  According to our staff projections, the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame. Transmission is working – lending growth is slowing, the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing. We are right on track. But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation. The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum. We now need to see whether this is sustained. We’ve seen very strong wage growth and weak or even falling productivity, leading to a sharp increase in the growth of unit labour costs. This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular, which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained. We’re going to watch upcoming wage agreements very closely. This will certainly also matter for our monetary policy decisions.  If the current level of restriction is sufficient, does that mean you do not see a need for further rate increases?  The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.  What is sufficiently long? Do you also see several quarters of steady rates?  We need to see more data. There’s first likely going to be an uptick in inflation. So, this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now. And most importantly, we need to see what’s going to happen to underlying inflation, to wage growth, to productivity, to unit profits. In order to be confident that we will sustainably return to our target, we need more time.  Am I reading it correctly that you’re not ruling out a rate cut before mid-year then?  We remain data dependent. That’s the main thing. We have to see what’s going to happen. We have been surprised many times in both directions. So, we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months’ time.   What is your view on the timeframe for ending pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments?  As President Lagarde mentioned, the Governing Council is going to discuss reinvestments under the PEPP in the not-too-distant future and I’ll leave it up to you to interpret what that means. It’s clear that discussion is going to come. It’s also clear that at some point we’re going to fully end PEPP reinvestments. The amounts involved are relatively small and markets are expecting this to happen, so I think it’s not such a big deal.  Am I correctly reading the mood that even if reinvestments end, there is no appetite for outright sales of bonds in either the asset purchase programme (APP) or PEPP portfolios?  We have never discussed outright sales.  You gave a speech in March in which you made the case for a demand-driven system for the ECB’s new operational framework. How has you thinking evolved since?  What I said in that speech is that a demand-driven system is well-suited for a heterogeneous currency union that may be prone to fragmentation. Such a system also likely limits the size of the central bank balance sheet. Of course, it can be designed in many different ways. What we are doing in our framework review is trying to find a system that implements our monetary policy effectively and efficiently in a way that minimises the negative side effects. So, the new system has to take into account the specificities of the euro area financial system. It has to be firmly embedded in our legal framework and it should limit our market footprint. But one should be aware that we are starting from a situation of abundant excess liquidity. So whatever framework we choose, money market rates will initially remain close to the floor.  What is the timeline for the balance sheet to shrink to its optimal size?   That depends on various factors that we can’t project perfectly. It also depends on the framework that we will eventually choose. One of the main drivers of the size of the central bank balance sheet is the growth of what we call autonomous factors – banknotes and official sector deposits – and the growth of reserve requirements. These factors already imply that the balance sheet is going to be around three times as large as before the global financial crisis.  In addition, banks could have a higher demand for excess liquidity for regulatory or precautionary reasons. If the outcome of the review was a demand-driven system, the size of the balance sheet would thus also depend on banks’ demand for excess liquidity. This would mean the size would not be determined by us, which is a good thing, because we don’t know precisely what the demand is.  The Federal Reserve has gone with the floor system. Could two of the world’s biggest central banks operate with different frameworks?  I do not see any problem with that. If you look around the world, you see many different frameworks.  The Fed has a supply-driven floor, the Bank of England a demand-driven floor, and Sveriges Riksbank a narrow corridor, while many central banks in emerging markets have a classical corridor. So, there is a wide variety of models out there that are tailor-made for specific financial systems.    Do you see the need for a structural portfolio of bonds and/or longer-term bank loans? What would the size of such a portfolio need to be?    I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of the framework review. There are different ways to provide liquidity to the financial system and all of them are going to be discussed in the review. We are going to weigh up the benefits and costs of each of them, and it could make sense to have a mix of different tools. We need to keep in mind, though, that this only matters far out in the future, because we are starting from a situation where we have a huge monetary policy bond portfolio. The structure of the balance sheet only becomes relevant when it has to grow again. As regards a structural portfolio, I mentioned in my March speech that this could be considered. Also keep in mind that we de facto already have a structural portfolio because some national central banks are holding bonds in their Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) portfolios.  What do you mean by “far out in the future”? Could it be next decade?  That depends on the decisions we are going to take. If we decided on both longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio, we would have to think about a potential split. But this really depends on many factors and I do not want to make any predictions. What is clear is that the balance sheet has to be much larger than it was before the global financial crisis. But, for all the frameworks under consideration, the balance sheet is going to be much smaller than it is now.  Should the ECB introduce new longer-term refinancing operations?  We will discuss the different options available to provide liquidity to the banks, including longer-term operations. But such a facility would have to be different from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) we were offering during the pandemic, in that it would have to be offered at market rates. From the banks’ perspective, longer-term lending operations are attractive because they provide a certain reliability of funding. And they reach all parts of the banking sector directly. That is very different from asset purchases – when you inject liquidity, it typically ends up with the larger banks and in certain financial centres.  Do you see a case for increasing the minimum reserve requirements, as some of your colleagues advocate?  We had a discussion on minimum reserve requirements in July and we discussed both the calibration and the remuneration. We decided to keep the minimum reserve requirements at 1% but to remunerate them at zero, instead of at the deposit facility rate. The reason for this was proportionality. With this change, we can implement our monetary policy stance in the same way and equally effectively while paying lower interest to the banks. That was the justification for reducing the remuneration. The proportionality argument implies that, if we have two options and one of them leads to losses while the other is just as effective in achieving price stability but reduces these losses, then we should choose the option that generates smaller losses. But let me stress that the minimum reserve requirements are not a tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. They also have distributional effects – they have the greatest impact on the banks with the highest deposit base, which tend to be the smaller banks. We are going to discuss the role of minimum reserve requirements in the operational framework review. And until then, we will not take any decisions.  To what extent should profit and loss considerations matter for monetary policy decisions?  Our monetary policy decisions are determined by our mandate. Profit and loss considerations matter only insofar as they affect our credibility and, consequently, our ability to pursue our mandate.  Andrea Enria argued recently that shadow banks need closer scrutiny, and the ECB could theoretically conduct this supervision. If the ECB supervised them, it could also provide them with access to liquidity facilities. Is that needed?  The experience of the pandemic shows that we are able to distribute liquidity across the financial sector without giving non-banks direct access to our balance sheet. At the moment we are not considering opening up our balance sheet to non-banks because there is no clear case for that.\n",
      "Content 11: INTERVIEW  Interview with De Standaard and La Libre Belgique   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Ruben Mooijman and Ariane van Caloen, on 23 November 2023 29 November 2023  Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.   What would you say to those who think that banks are making excessive profits?   The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, which has just been published, indeed shows that bank profitability has risen sharply. This improvement can be attributed to the widening of interest rate margins. The return on equity of euro area banks now stands at around 10%, whereas in 2019, barely five years ago, it stood at 4%. So it has clearly improved.  Still, this is something of an illusion − it is after all a short-term improvement. In the long term, we expect profitability to fall again. Why? There are several factors. First, the economy is slowing, which will lead to higher default rates and a decline in asset quality. Second, banks will have to pay more to attract deposits. On term accounts, for example, interest rates have already risen sharply. Likewise, the bonds that banks issue themselves will need to carry a higher return. So overall the cost of bank funding is on the rise. And finally, an often-overlooked factor is that demand for credit is falling. Putting all that together, you can see that high bank profitability is not sustainable. In fact, the financial markets are already convinced of this, as bank share valuations are in no way reflecting expectations of high profits.  Are the banks sufficiently covered for interest rate risks. If not, could the regulator, the ECB, review its requirements?   The interest rate risk of European banks can’t be compared to that run by some US banks such as Silicon Valley Bank with a different business model. The repricing of loans, in other words, raising interest rates in line with the market rate, has been much faster than the repricing of deposits in Europe. However, the interest rates on deposits will also increase at some point.  So is interest rate risk adequately covered?  Yes, but at the same time banks will be facing a loss of profitability as I said. I am talking about the average for the sector.   There has been a lot of debate about interest rates on savings. Politicians are taking initiatives to get banks to raise interest rates. Is that a good idea?  If the ECB raises interest rates, it is for borrowers and savers. Lending rates have risen and the remuneration of deposits is expected to follow suit. The remuneration on savings accounts should reflect our interest rates. That is part of our monetary policy transmission. Because if savings become more attractive, consumers will spend less, reducing demand. This is what we aim for to push down inflation. However, we now see banks are delaying passing on higher interest rates to savers. They can do that because they still benefit from abundant liquidity right now. But we are also taking measures to reduce excess liquidity, so that higher interest rates on savings accounts will become a reality – sooner or later.  Do you see differences between member states in this respect?  Yes, there are differences. In some countries, banks are quick to adjust interest rates on deposits, and in others, such as Spain, they are lagging behind. Euro area banking sectors also differ in the way mortgage loans are granted, whether it is at variable or fixed rates. Strengthening of profitability was particularly notable for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates and the pass-through of higher policy rates to deposits has been slower.  And Belgium?  I know the Spanish situation because it’s my own country, but we look at euro area averages and developments as a whole.  Some economists criticise the system that allows banks to make money easily by depositing their excess liquidity with the ECB. This is resulting in generous profits at the moment because interest rates are rising. What’s your take on this?  The ECB has raised its interest rates with a view to these increases being passed on to all remuneration categories in bank balance sheets. The level of liquidity in the market was extremely high and had to be reduced. This reduction is under way now and will go hand-in-hand with a decline in these types of revenues for banks.  You have also changed the remuneration of the minimum reserve requirement for banks. Some bankers believe that this should be raised to ensure a stronger capital base. Do you think that’s a good idea?  We have indeed set the remuneration of banks’ minimum reserves to 0%. The levels of those reserves have so far not been changed or discussed. I know some central bank governors are in favour of increasing them. We have limited the remuneration on the minimum reserve requirement, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of banks’ liabilities. I understand that remuneration of reserves is important for some banks, but monetary policy shouldn’t be driven by the financial position of banks or the profits of the central banks. Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.  National central banks are going to have to report significant losses owing to the policy of quantitative easing, which led to huge purchases of sovereign bonds to inject liquidity into the market. Do these losses pose a problem?  It’s true that central banks are currently reporting losses owing to the hike in interest rates, but if we look at a longer period of time, for instance over the last 10 years, the net outcome is positive in terms of central bank profits.  What about the real estate market? People are complaining about the higher cost of loans. What would you say to them?   What is happening is part of our monetary policy. The sharp rise in interest rates is starting to dampen real estate prices. This is more apparent in some countries than others, but a moderation in price trends can be seen everywhere. On average, house prices are stabilising. The decline in commercial property prices is much more pronounced.   Does the situation pose a danger?   It could affect banks, but fortunately they are less exposed to commercial real estate than they are to residential real estate. Commercial real estate is more often financed through other channels, such as mutual funds. But in the financial system there is a high degree of interconnectedness, so we look at the overall picture.  Huge investments are needed to make homes and other buildings climate-proof. Are the higher interest rates delaying funding for investments aimed at combating climate change? Could that slow down the climate transition?  It’s true that substantial investments are needed, but I think they should mainly be financed through subsidies and European funds like the Next Generation EU. This is a matter for fiscal policy. That doesn’t alter the fact that the ECB conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing rates without discriminating between sectors or borrowers.   Monetary policy also affects the climate transition in other ways. Some investments are being jeopardised by higher financing costs. This has already resulted in plans for various wind farms being scrapped.  The ECB pays close attention to climate policy, but for us it’s a secondary objective. It’s national governments that play the leading role in climate policy, through taxes and subsidies. We can contribute though – and we do. For example, we prioritise climate-friendly companies in our corporate bond portfolio. This is a small contribution, but it sends a clear signal in the fight against climate change.  The ECB is preparing to introduce a digital euro. Why is that necessary?  We currently have a physical euro in our wallets, whereas the world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. There is a very natural evolution taking place from a physical to a digital euro backed by the central bank. We see the digital euro as a means of payment. We would be able to use this form of public money to pay for our shopping, our bill in a restaurant or all sorts of purchases. Like banknotes, the digital euro will not have to be remunerated. There will be a limit on the amount of digital euro people can hold, to avoid endangering the stability of the banking system. This means that the digital euro won’t compete with current accounts. That is a very clear message we want to send to the banking sector. The digital euro will not be an investment product but a simple means of payment to complement banknotes.  Won’t implementing the digital euro be very expensive for the ECB?  This will be part of our calculations during the preparation phase over the next two years, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted but, in my view, the benefits will outweigh the costs. It will offer another alternative means of payment to those living in the euro area. It will also enable us to take another step towards European strategic autonomy. And at the end of the preparation phase the decision will be taken by the European Commission, the European Council of the European Union and European Parliament.  A number of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, are struggling with how inflation is measured. The way it’s measured means actual inflation is sometimes overestimated and sometimes underestimated. Isn't that a problem for the ECB, as it’s tasked with fighting inflation?  Indeed, changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated. But that's a matter for Eurostat, not the ECB, and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward. Statistical changes to the compilation of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) occur from time to time. A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not. As you know, that was one of the conclusions of our monetary policy strategic review. We work and share information with Eurostat on that topic, with a view to enhancing the HICP. But not on the measurement of energy prices, which is a statistical choice to how the country’s price index is compiled.  Europe is planning to use the profits from frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear to help rebuild Ukraine. The ECB is critical of this. Can you explain why?  Let me first clarify that the ECB is in favour of helping and supporting Ukraine in any way possible. But our position on utilising the dividends and interest from the frozen assets is clear. First: this should be a global decision, ideally involving all members of the G7. In addition, we have to be careful because this could lead to reputational damage. We have to look beyond this conflict in isolation, and there could be implications for the euro as a safe currency. The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation. I think there are other ways to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In Belgium, the launch of the ethical bank NewB has proved very difficult. Are barriers to setting up new banks in the eurozone too high?  Without entering into the details of any particular case, there are different procedures to be followed and criteria to be met, but there are no limitations beyond the legal and capital requirements imposed for the creation of a new retail bank.  But there haven’t been very many new banks in the last few years...  Because there are a lot of banks in the euro area! The real question to ask is about banks’ traditional business model. New sources of revenue need to be found, the number of branches has to be reduced. I suppose that investors are turning away from banks because the level of profitability doesn’t meet their expectations. I think there needs to be further cross-border consolidation.  So are there too many banks?  Given the cost structure of European banks, consolidation could help provide a solution. Above all else, I think cross-border consolidation in the euro area under a single supervisor and within the framework of a single monetary policy would be positive.\n",
      "Content 12: INTERVIEW  Interview with Finance   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Albina Kenda 9 November 2023  The ECB did not change its key interest rates at its October meeting, interrupting the series of ten consecutive interest rate increases that had brought rates up by 4.5 percentage points since July 2022. A few days later Eurostat announced that euro area headline inflation had fallen to 2.9% in October. Does this mean that interest rate hikes are over?  It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level, and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2% level we define as price stability.  The evolution of inflation has been positive overall: it was above 10% only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9%. At the same time, core inflation has also been moderating. But we have to be prudent and cautious, as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months. We will continue taking a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions.   Euro area GDP was down by 0.1% in the third quarter, and economists think inflation may rise again over the coming months as the positive base effect will progressively fade out. At the same time, there is a risk of another commodity price shock arising from the situation in the Middle East. If the ECB finds itself at a crossroads, will it prioritise growth or inflation?  Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2%. Unlike some other central banks, the ECB does not have a dual mandate.  At the same time, we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation. We expect that growth will stagnate in the second half of the year and that the fourth quarter will not differ much from the third. Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth; some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.  Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025, with some fluctuations caused by base effects. However, we believe that, if interest rates are maintained at their current levels, inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.   The ECB will publish new forecasts in December. Will these be more or less the same as in September, or are you expecting upward revisions for inflation and downward revisions for growth?   It might be premature to say it, but leading indicators point to the growth outlook being somewhat more negative than we previously projected. As regards inflation, the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.  You mentioned the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to decision-making. But in October the ECB said it considers its key interest rates to be at levels that will make a substantial contribution to lowering inflation, provided they are maintained at those levels for a sufficiently long duration. What is meant by “sufficiently long”?  This means a period of time that takes into account the potential lags of monetary policy. Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive, and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down, as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was. I would not define “sufficiently long” as used in our monetary policy statement as a concrete period of time. We will need to determine this on the basis of data. In our decision-making we will also have to take into account the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical risks related to the conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine.  But what kind of data would the ECB need to see to start reducing interest rates rather than simply keeping them at restrictive levels?  We are not there yet. We will see how things evolve month by month, but our approach now is to keep interest rates at this level long enough to reach our target. Any discussion about lowering interest rates is clearly premature.  To what extent did the ECB’s monetary policy take into account not just the euro area average but the situation in individual Member States, as there are significant differences among them, also in their level of inflation. According to Eurostat, in October Slovakia recorded the highest inflation rate of 7.8%, Slovenia registered 6.6%, while the Netherlands and Belgium recorded deflation of 1% and 1.7% respectively.  We have seen disparities among euro area countries in their economic and financial structures, in the weight of services in their economies and not least in their proximity to the conflict in Ukraine.      There are always differences in inflation and growth, but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries. Our measure of price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.  In dealing with the disparities, it is important to consider the effects of fiscal policies. With regard to base effects, we have to look at how governments have introduced, and have started to withdraw, support measures to mitigate the shocks of the energy crisis. Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries. But our monetary policy is single.  The ECB is now looking more closely, in line with other central banks, at core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. What are ECB’s main concerns in this regard? ECB President Christine Lagarde said this summer that profit margins contributed almost two-thirds to domestic inflation last year. Almost nobody mentions this anymore, but there is now a discussion about the effects of wage increases.   It is essential to focus on core inflation, for which there are several risks. First, there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation. Second, there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate, which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation. And finally, there are unit labour costs. Rising labour costs result from two factors. The first one is wage developments, with wage growth in the euro area now at just over 5%. The second is productivity, which is very low and has been declining because employment growth has been outpacing output growth.  It is true that profit margins grew even faster than unit labour costs last year. This year, however, we are seeing a moderation in profit margins, while labour costs are on the rise.  Our expectation is that part of the increase in labour costs will be absorbed via profit margins, meaning that not all of this increase will be passed through to final prices.   At the ECB, you are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to deepen your understanding of inflation. What will you do differently from what you have been doing so far and what do you hope to achieve? We know that, while not the only one, you have been wrong as far as the inflation forecast is concerned.   Our colleagues working with statistics deal with a lot of information, a lot of data on the financial system and the real economy, so any instrument that helps us manage this monumental amount of information is very useful.  So we are continually looking for algorithms that can give us a better understanding of what is happening in the economy, in the financial system, and a way of factoring in all the underlying tendencies that are embedded in the data we analyse.   There have been warnings that in its fight against inflation the ECB has been focusing only on the demand side of the economy, while supply-side factors also contribute to inflation. Is a more balanced approach warranted for the future, bearing in mind the pressures that may stem from geopolitical tensions, the demographic picture and the implications of the Green Deal? The economy has already been disrupted, is monetary policy next?  Sometimes it is important to stress that monetary policy works through interest rate increases, through the transmission of monetary policy decisions to financing conditions and then through the impact of financing conditions on aggregate demand.  So, monetary policy and the transmission of its decisions aim to influence aggregate demand, consumption and investment. Monetary policy cannot deal with supply-side issues. These need to be addressed through structural policies and fiscal policies.  Let me add that it’s not only the origin of inflation that’s important, but also the possibility of second-round effects, which can make the situation much more complicated, with a possible price-wage-profit spiral. In particular, we need to avoid de-anchoring inflation expectations, as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.  It was announced a while ago that the ECB, in cooperation with Eurostat, would include housing costs in the calculation of inflation. How far along is this project?  This was part of the ECB’s strategy review, and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation. However, such costs need to be well calibrated in the index, and this is mainly Eurostat’s responsibility. Including the cost of owner-occupied housing in the measurement – known as the owner-occupied property cost – contributes to the calibration of inflation. We are very willing to cooperate with Eurostat and provide our input and insights.   So there is no deadline?  It is not up to us. But there is a need for harmonised action at EU level, not just in the euro area, and this takes time.   The ECB has dealt with record-high euro area inflation by raising interest rates at a record pace. In the banking systems of several countries, including Slovenia, borrowers have felt the effects of this policy much more than savers. Is this also due to the consolidation of the banking market and the subsequent lack of competition?   You are right about the effects. As you know, we have made it crystal clear: whenever we raise our key interest rates, this increase should be passed on to all sides of the market.  The current situation can be explained by several factors. First, there is excess liquidity, so banks haven’t been under pressure to raise the remuneration of deposits. However, liquidity conditions are becoming less and less comfortable for European banks – there have been changes to the parameters for long-term liquidity lending to banks under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and changes to our bond-buying programmes, so the decline in liquidity will continue. Second, banks are always slower to change their pricing policy for deposits than they are for loans.  But there is a slow-but-steady increase in the remuneration of deposits, particularly time deposits. We believe that this process will continue. We are monitoring it very closely and, I’ll say it again, when we raise interest rates, we are not only raising them for borrowers, but for savers too, because otherwise the transmission of monetary policy would be incomplete.   Given that deposit interest rates lagging behind lending rates has resulted in considerable growth in banks’ net interest income, could you say that banks are pursuing short-term goals instead of long-term sustainable business goals, especially as you said yourself that the ECB is now determined to reduce excess liquidity in the system?  You’re right – the profitability of European banks has improved recently owing to the increase in key interest rates and an improvement in profit margins.  However, this has not been reflected in the market valuation of banks because markets believe that this improvement in profitability may not be sustainable over time. First, because the economy is slowing, which could lead to an increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Second, because the drop in demand for loans would reduce banks’ revenues. And third, because the cost of funding for banks is rising.  So I think that it’s quite obvious that, despite the improved profitability of banks, there are doubts about how sustainable this will be in the longer term.   What are the challenges to financial stability in the euro area now that we are in a phase of economic slowdown? What is the situation regarding insolvency proceedings, non-performing loans and risks to the banking system stemming from the real estate market? In Germany, residential property prices fell by around 10% in the second quarter. Do you expect a correction elsewhere as a consequence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening?  When interest rates go up, the financial stability situation changes. The first factor we have to look at is valuations of financial assets and real estate assets. One of the main risks we see in terms of financial stability in the euro area is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment of asset prices and the implications it could have for banks. It should be stressed that banks are in a good position in terms of profitability, capital and liquidity. But we cannot be complacent because, as I said, there are some doubts about how sustainable this improvement is going to be over time.  There is another factor for financial stability. We look very carefully at non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly real estate mutual funds. In this regard, we have seen a significant drop in commercial real estate valuations. This decline had set in before the start of the monetary policy tightening but has now accelerated following the rise in interest rates. A number of non-bank financial intermediaries have seen very steep declines, particularly in commercial real estate.  In addition to economic cooling, we are also witnessing a housing crisis across the EU. How do you respond to the criticism that the ECB’s monetary policy has contributed to this, first with bond purchases that lowered bond yields, which led institutional investors to turn to the property market for returns, and now by increasing borrowing costs, which has caused many building projects to be postponed or completely abandoned?  We can be criticised for being too lenient or for being too tough. But, if I may say, I don’t think it’s fair to be criticised for both things at the same time. There were reasons why we had a very expansionary monetary policy – think back to the pandemic and the decline in GDP. I think that without our monetary policy, the situation would have been much worse. Going back even further, to the era of quantitative easing, you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis. However, sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge, and we had to respond.  Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability. Sometimes there are lateral effects. But there are also other policies to deal with a potential real estate bubble, such as fiscal and macroprudential policies.   In other words, you are looking at developments in the real estate market through the prism of the financial stability of the banking system.  For sure. My point is that monetary policy has to be focused on price stability. However, there are other instruments available, like fiscal and other policies. In the event of real estate market growth that is not fully aligned with fundamentals, macroprudential policies can be applied, bank capital buffers can be increased and borrower-based measures can be used to limit excessive growth in real estate lending. A range of policies are available.   What are the latest trends in the credit situation in the euro area?  The evolution is quite clear: financing conditions have tightened as a result of our monetary policy decisions, resulting in a decline in credit demand, which can be seen for both households and firms. This is how monetary policy works.   My last question is on the tax issue. Banks are reporting high profits, largely due to higher net interest income. As a result, several governments have decided to levy additional taxes on them. Why is the ECB not in favour?  Our decision is based on two pillars. The first is that this kind of tax should not impair lending or the transmission of monetary policy measures to the system. The second is that such a tax should not damage the solvency of banks, as this could have medium-term consequences for banks that are not well capitalised.  We have already issued opinions for Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and now Slovenia. The taxes are not all the same, but each opinion points out that the tax should not impair lending and should not damage the solvency of banks.\n",
      "Content 13: INTERVIEW  Interview with Kathimerini   Interview with Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB, conducted by Alexis Papahelas on 30 October 4 November 2023  When you were in Athens last week, you talked about Greece’s resilience and its phenomenal recovery capacity. Could you tell me how this happened? How did Greece become a success story?  When I look at the key performance indicators for assessing Greece’s economic and financial situation, I see improvements across the board: in employment, growth, the fiscal situation and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Greece has completed many of the reforms on its to-do list. Not all of them, of course. There is still more work to be done. I understand that there are more reforms in the pipeline but, overall, the results of the country’s efforts are impressive. And this did not go unnoticed by those whose job it is to rate an economy and assess its credit rating – as shown by the two recent decisions that raised Greece’s rating to investment grade. I think it’s a tremendous testament to the country’s efforts. The turnaround was thanks to the fiscal adjustments and the reforms that were implemented, but also to the resolute efforts of the Greek people and the Greek authorities.  Is the high debt-to-GDP ratio of any concern to you?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is around 160% at the moment. It has fallen significantly in the last couple of years. And obviously this downward trend needs to continue in the future. I know there is more to come, but Greece has evidently responded to this challenge with determination, and the results are already clear to see.  Did you ever get really worried about Grexit? Did you think that it was possible?  There were two particular moments where the threat could have materialised. The first was during the French G20 presidency in November 2011, when there was talk of a possible referendum, which didn’t happen in the end. The second, when the threat was much more tangible and much more worrying, was in July 2015. So, we had two Grexit threats, but the one in 2015 was the most concrete, and if it hadn’t been for the determination of a few European leaders, it would have happened.  You had a front-row seat to the Greek financial crisis from a very early stage. When you look back, do you think that any mistakes were made?  The original mistake was for the country to have found itself in that situation. If there had been greater fiscal discipline and if the prudent principle of establishing a rainy-day fund for bad times when the economy was doing well had been applied, the crisis might not have happened. The fiscal policies in place before and after the crisis hit in 2009 were the original mistakes. As I have said before, it would have been helpful for the IMF to have had longer programmes than those available in its arsenal. The programmes it had were intended for rapid and deep changes, reforms and fiscal consolidation. At the time they weren’t necessarily the best tools for a country that was in a monetary union without a fiscal union or for Greece’s specific fiscal situation.  Did you learn any lessons or draw any conclusions of your own from the crisis?  One very pertinent lesson is to make sure that we have the collective discipline to address the lack of a fiscal union. I think this should be a very pressing concern for all of us. When you have a monetary union without a fiscal union, as we do, you need clear fiscal guardrails and a fiscal framework within which countries can design and implement their fiscal policies and be accountable to the other members of the monetary union. Something else that stands out from the Greek situation is that decisions were made but then sometimes reversed by the subsequent political team. And, even when decisions were taken, the implementation and monitoring needed to move forward didn’t always happen. Another lesson is that, even when banks are not the cause of a crisis, a solid and robust financial sector with well-capitalised banks is crucial.  Are you satisfied with the current state of the Greek banking system?  I think a lot of work has been done to consolidate and strengthen the Greek banking sector. Take non-performing loans, for example. In 2016 almost 50% of loans were non-performing. Now it is just over 8%. That is a significant sign of improvement, which has involved parking those non-performing loans outside the banks. So, in a way, the banking system has been sanitised. Capital ratios are much stronger, non-performing loans have gone down and liquidity ratios are also quite solid. So yes, a lot has been done to make Greek banks more robust and more attractive.  I think the fact that a large foreign bank is taking an interest in a Greek bank is a clear indication that the sector has become more attractive.  Do you think 10 or 12 years ago it would have been possible for you and the Governor of the Bank of Greece Yannis Stournaras to take a walk around Syntagma Square where all the demonstrations were happening? What was going through your mind when you actually did it this time?  I was totally bemused by the transformation, I have to tell you. As you know, I did not come to Greece at the height of the crisis, but I was obviously in frequent contact with the team. I was following the IMF mission’s visits very closely – special security measures were taken and it was a source of anxiety and concern. Now, to walk down the street, say hello to people and feel their energy, vitality and optimism was quite striking. It is a testament to the effort and the determination of the Greeks to turn things around and to take hold of their destiny with the discipline and seriousness required in a union like the EU. I think it’s fantastic that Greece can set standards and be an example of what to do, of what reforms to implement.  Do you have the sense that economic events are driven by geopolitics these days? How hard is it to carry out fiscal and, more importantly, monetary policy?  You and I have been around for a little while. And I think that geopolitics taking precedence over many other developments is nothing new. What I think is slightly different now is that there is a compounded effect of multiple geopolitical developments taking place in various corners of the world. Sometimes they are a reflection of a major schism happening in front of us. When the world had a bipolar power structure, when it was fairly organised and settled, you could anticipate things. You could have more certainty about future developments. Now it’s far more fragmented. Crises are taking place in various parts of the globe at the same time, and it’s not clear who is on whose side and what the next development will be, let alone the final outcome of the current crisis in the Middle East. And if you add to that the crisis that we have just gone through with the pandemic, plus the terribly serious challenge of climate change, which is a tragedy that is already unfolding, that’s a lot of geopolitical and climate-related developments taking place together. That’s what’s making it even harder at the moment, which is why I think that we are confronted with shifts and breaks that, although not unimaginable, certainly fly in the face of the traditional way of thinking or the certainties that we used to have.  Do you think that inflation will recede next year?  This is certainly our forecast and this is certainly our goal. We are determined to bring inflation down to 2%. According to our projections we will get there in 2025.  It seems as though increases in food prices and housing are almost becoming structural now. Are you worried about the political implications of all this, about the political pressures stemming from the rise in the cost of living?  When we measure inflation, we pay attention to the headline rate, which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing – how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car, food on the table, or to have clothes, shelter and everything else. But we also try to understand what is underneath the most variable components. One of those components is food. Is the price of food going to be higher in the future? That’s a possibility if you look at the impact of climate change, for example. Droughts, floods, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will most likely have an impact on food prices going forward .  As for the political implications that you asked me about, let me say that our mandate is to ensure price stability, and this is the best contribution we can make to social peace and to society, to the most vulnerable of its members in particular.  The last question I’d like to ask you is what really keeps you up at night?  I try to sleep as much as I can, and at the moment it’s not a lot, I have to say. When I go to bed, I’m really tired and I fall asleep. But what preoccupies me before I go to bed is the level of violence, hatred and hubris around, which is first and foremost terrible for people – terrible for children and terrible for civilians. And of course, in addition to the human suffering, all this will have an impact on our economies, on the level of people’s confidence, and it will probably make our job a little bit harder going forward.\n",
      "Content 14: INTERVIEW  Interview with Het Financieele Dagblad   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Marcel de Boer, Marijn Jongsma and Joost van Kuppeveld on 11 October 2023 16 October 2023  Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.  First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.  What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?  This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.  Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?  What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.  Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.  We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.  QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?  We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate. This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.  Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?   Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.  So no lowering of interest rates until spring?  We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.  And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?  Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.   As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?  I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty. And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.  Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?  I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.\n",
      "Content 15: INTERVIEW  Interview with La Tribune Dimanche   Interview with Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB, conducted by Marie-Pierre Gröndahl on 2 October 2023 8 October 2023  The ECB raised its key interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in fourteen months, bringing the rate on the deposit facility to 4%, its highest level since the launch of the euro. Coming at a time when people are concerned about the level of interest rates, was this move justified?   We first need to put the action taken by the European Central Bank into context. For several years now the world has been facing a “permacrisis”, a constant succession of serious and unprecedented crises − in terms of their scale, their impact and the speed at which they emerged. The health crisis was followed by Russia’s unjustified war in Ukraine, and then by an acceleration in inflation. All this against the backdrop of the energy crisis, with a number of EU countries experiencing difficulties in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, including real estate.  The ECB’s mandate, unchanged for 25 years, is price stability. It’s our compass. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.     Do you have the tools you need to fight inflation?   Our models were not perfectly suited to the nature of these crises, which resulted, among other things, in the complete shutdown of part of the economy during the health crisis, leading to a greater role for governments, which suddenly became protective. They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades, or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation. The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections. We have worked on these issues, and we are continuing to do so, in order to make the projections more robust.   Have the past projection errors dented trust in the ECB’s actions?    Close to 80% of euro area citizens believe in and support the euro. And 45% trust the ECB, slightly more than did so before the health crisis. But we are constantly seeking effective methods and better channels of communication to explain our actions and counter fake news, which spreads far more quickly than the facts, also in the economic world. The ECB was the first central bank to acknowledge its errors with regard to the projections and to analyse the reasons for them.   And what are these reasons?  The errors were largely caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. Growth has declined across all economies – in advanced, emerging and developing countries. And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world, apart from in China. A very worrying situation, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6% in October 2022, more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3%. That means that within one year, the efforts made – along with base effects, i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago – have slowed the pace of inflation.  But that’s not the general feeling in Europe…  It’s hard to explain that the rise in prices is slowing down. Inflation persists, but it is abating and even steadily declining. That’s good news. I think our efforts have played a part in this, as have some of the economic policies pursued in Europe. At the same time, growth is weakening, which is why the International Monetary Fund has revised down its growth projections worldwide, except for the United States.  Why this gap with Europe?    Potential growth in the United States has traditionally exceeded that of Europe or of the euro area by close to 1 percentage point on average. It’s not meaningful to compare them: you can’t compare a single country with several countries. The euro area comprises 20 different countries, 20 different fiscal policies, 20 different treasuries. For a start, the United States is protected by the dollar, an international reference currency. The US economy is far more responsive and adjusts more rapidly. And it is not energy-dependent, unlike Europe, which has to import 80% of its energy.   Growth is falling in Europe. Is there a risk of recession?  We have revised down our growth projections to 0.7% in 2023, 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. The rate for 2025 is only slightly below the potential growth of the euro area. In Europe, we have devised a response and deployed unprecedented defensive measures that would have been unimaginable just three years ago, notably thanks to the Next Generation EU programme. Structural reforms are being put in place. And, just one year ago, who would have thought that we would succeed in replenishing more than 90% of our gas reserves by September 2023? This allows us to look towards the coming winter, if not calmly, then at least with a lot more confidence.   The German economy, the largest in the euro area, is slowing down sharply. What impact will this have?  This is one of the factors that is indeed weighing on the outlook for European growth. Germany had built its economic model on very cheap energy supplies and on export opportunities, especially to China. The ongoing adjustment in the German economy is affecting the growth outlook.   Does that complicate the ECB’s mission?  First and foremost, the ECB has to answer the question of how to provide price stability for economic actors across the entire euro area. To this end, we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area, as well as underlying inflation – excluding energy and food.  In France, people are acutely aware of inflation. Why is that?  High and persistent inflation affects people’s purchasing power. But overall, while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average, for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.  Is this also due to the rise in interest rates?  Not exclusively. The ECB rates are the same for France as for all euro area countries. We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.  Doesn’t this threaten growth?  Our mandate is price stability, and interest rates are our tool. We raise rates to make the financing of economic activity more expensive in a manner that dampens demand, and to thus bring about an adjustment between supply and demand, notably through reduced investment and consumption. The goal is obviously not to create a recession, but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and, above all, prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral. We must avoid this at all costs. We want to get inflation back to 2%, and we will achieve that.  Is there a risk of a wage-price spiral?  We aren’t seeing that for the moment, but we are monitoring it closely. Wage growth is expected to be around 5.3% in the euro area in 2023, and that figure is projected to be 4.3% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2% over the coming years.  Is the housing crisis that is picking up pace in France and Germany collateral damage from monetary policy?  The ECB sets the key interest rates in view of its price stability mandate. The housing sector is indeed sensitive to interest rates. But for many of the problems, all authorities need to get around the table and think about the stock of housing supply, and about social housing in particular. The fact remains that the major risk would be if people get into debt without having adequate means and are then confronted with repayment deadlines they cannot meet.  Is the ECB pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook?  There are three reasons why we are not pessimistic. We expect growth figures to increase next year. Inflation is currently falling significantly. And the employment rate is higher than it’s ever been in Europe, and it’s stabilising at that level. The big question right now concerns businesses. Will they accept absorbing part of the salary increases that will be negotiated this year and next in their margins – which didn’t change much in 2022? This is a key question. In our economic projections, we assume that businesses will behave as they have done during previous crises, in that they will reduce their margins a little in order to absorb part of the salary increases. The fall in demand should point them in that direction. It’s in their interest to do so, as public opinion will put them under pressure, as will the public authorities. The second element that is very important is energy prices. I think we have to get used to the idea that oil prices will remain high. This should spur us to pursue the fight against climate change even more vigorously, and to shift towards an energy mix that is less dependent on fossil fuels and foreign suppliers.  Anxiety is growing in European society in the face of a number of measures taken to fight climate change. How should we react?  We cannot wait. Combating climate change is imperative – we should all be hammering that message home. Everyone needs to realise it’s an emergency. We will only achieve this energy transition if we have everyone’s support, and with distributive policies that don’t worsen inequality. We cannot allow the energy transition to fail. Nor can we allow the consequences of climate change to become long-lasting. That is not an option. We have to find the fiscal and social means to make it as painless as possible for everyone, and for the most vulnerable in particular. A collective approach is needed. If there is any area where Europeans should borrow collectively, invest and share the burden as equally as possible, it’s the fight against climate change.  What will follow the current version of the Stability and Growth Pact?  I hope the European Heads of State or Government and the finance ministers will reach an agreement before the end of the year. The sooner there is an agreement on a reformed fiscal framework, the earlier we have clarity on the path of fiscal policies going forward.\n",
      "Content 16: INTERVIEW  Interview with Jutarnji list   Interview with Isabel Schnabel,  of the ECB, conducted by Marina Klepo on 29 September 2023 6 October 2023    From the ECB's perspective, have the new [September inflation] data brought about any changes in terms of the drivers of inflation growth?    Overall, the recent news on inflation is encouraging. Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably, and it now stands at 4.3% after peaking at 10.6% in October of last year. A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks, as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly. It is also a consequence of statistical effects, the so-called base effects, given that we had unusually large price increases a year ago. When it comes to core inflation, which excludes energy and food, it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5% in the euro area, hence above headline inflation. However, its September print was lower than expected.  It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly, but it is still well above our target of 2%, which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, that “last kilometre” may well prove to be the hardest.  How worrying is the oil price increase that we have witnessed in recent months?  The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on, because we could have new supply side shocks stemming, for instance, from energy or food prices. This year, we’ve experienced frequent extreme weather events, which may have an impact on harvests and lead to higher food prices next year. In addition, the base effects from energy may eventually reverse, putting upside pressure on inflation. Therefore,  we must not be complacent, and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.  What does it mean for the broad expectations among economists, the financial markets and even among central banks, that there will be no need for further interest rate hikes? That’s at least how the latest ECB messages have been interpreted.  One has to look carefully at what we communicated. We said that our decisions will continue to be data dependent. Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2%. However,  we cannot say that we are at the peak or for how long rates will need to be kept at restrictive levels. This will depend on the data, so we will continue to look at three factors: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all of them are moving in the right direction. But I still see upside risks to inflation. There could be new supply side shocks. Moreover, wages could grow more strongly than expected, potentially accompanied by lower-than-expected productivity growth, while firms might not absorb those higher costs through their profit margins. Such risks need to be monitored carefully. If they materialised, further interest rate hikes could be necessary at some point.  Even though inflation has slowed considerably, there are still major differences in inflation rates among countries, ranging from negative numbers in the Netherlands to almost 9% in Slovakia. To what extent do these differences affect the setting of monetary policy? Are they really taken into account?  Our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. Naturally, our monetary policy decisions also take into account information from individual Member States, but we cannot respond to specific developments in a particular country. Such developments are best tackled by national policies, such as fiscal or structural policies. The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation. There are several reasons for the large role played by energy: First, countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation. Second, governments responded differently to the energy price shock, with some governments imposing price controls, which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on. Of course, these measures also had different fiscal implications, because some of them expire automatically when energy prices fall, while others need to be actively reversed, which typically takes longer. And finally, the institutional characteristics of energy markets differ across Member States. In some of them, wholesale energy prices translate quickly into retail prices, both when energy prices rise and fall. In other countries the response is more sluggish due to the fact that there are fixed-price contracts in place with a long duration. One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices, which constitute a large share of the consumption basket. This heterogeneity complicates our monetary policy, but we nevertheless need to focus on the euro area as a whole.  The government in Croatia, as well as in some other countries, is trying to introduce price controls on energy and certain basic consumer items. What is your view of these measures, what are the good and the bad sides of such an approach to lowering inflationary pressures?  Measures that directly control prices, such as price caps, have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which may be reversed once the measures are lifted. This helps to smooth inflation over time, but it also distorts the steering effect of prices. This may be counterproductive, because it does not incentivise lower consumption, for example, of energy. In addition, such measures can weigh heavily on the fiscal budget, especially if they are broad-based rather than targeting the more vulnerable groups. In general, measures that increase the supply capacity are preferable to those that directly control prices.  But do they work in the short run?  In the short run, they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation, which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers, as these often depend on current developments in inflation. But overall, the negative effects often outweigh the positive.   One of the problems in Croatia, which has one of the highest inflation rates in the euro area, seems to lie in ample excess liquidity in the banking sector. This has increased strongly since Croatia joined the euro area on account of banks’ lower minimum reserve requirements. The argument is that this impedes the transmission of higher ECB interest rates and prevents a stronger impact on inflation. What do your analyses on the success of monetary policy transmission in Member States indicate?  What matters for monetary policy in a currency union is excess liquidity at the euro area level and not at the country level. Excess liquidity in the euro area is very high, but this does not impede monetary policy transmission. We have seen that the increases in our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, have been fully transmitted to the money market and have translated into a measurable increase in funding costs in the economy. But you are right, monetary policy transmission can play out differently across Member States. One crucial factor is the prevalence of variable versus fixed-rate loans. The average lending rates adjust more quickly if there is a higher share of loans with a variable interest rate. Croatia is a special case, given that it joined the euro just recently. The drop in minimum reserve requirements from a level of 9% to 1% led to an increase in excess liquidity in the system. However, the strong loan growth that we are seeing in Croatia is not related to this but to the relatively strong economic performance, which is partly driven by the boom in tourism. That is why the Croatian National Bank decided to further increase the countercyclical capital buffer for banks to counter excessive loan growth. This is another way of dealing with the heterogeneity in a currency union, using macroprudential tools at the national level.  Would that be in the national central bank’s domain?  Yes, these macroprudential tools are mainly decided at national rather than European level – in Croatia’s case by the central bank – so they can be adjusted to the specific situation in a given country.   Do you see tourism as the main contributor to economic growth and credit activity in Croatia?  It is definitely one of the factors driving growth in Croatia’s economy. It has always been a very attractive place for summer holidays, and its attractiveness has probably increased since it joined the euro area. Two of my daughters, for example, travelled to Croatia recently, not only because it is beautiful, but also because it now has the euro.  The general public is concerned by the fact that banks are faring the best under the current circumstances, because they are generating high income from central banks without any effort or risk.   This is related to the high volume of excess liquidity created by our previous monetary policy actions: the lending operations and bond purchases, which we call quantitative easing. Excess liquidity is remunerated at our deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. In line with our interest rate tightening, we have now started to shrink our balance sheet, and this is happening very quickly, even though the balance sheet is still very large.  We need to pay interest on reserves, at least at the margin, to make sure that short-term money market rates are closely anchored to our policy rate and therefore in line with our intended monetary policy stance. Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control. Now, what seems to create most of the unease is that banks raised their lending rates much more quickly than they passed these increases on to their depositors. But this transmission is getting stronger. Rates on time deposits have risen quite a bit, and we also see that people are beginning to shift their funds out of sight deposits into alternative investments that pay higher interest rates.  This market mechanism eventually forces banks to adjust their deposit rates. But this also means that banks’ funding costs will go up over time. Even though the impact on profitability is very positive in the short run, longer-term consequences of higher interest rates on bank profitability may well prove to be less benign, because the interest income on bank assets may rise more slowly than their funding costs.  The ECB recently abolished the remuneration paid to banks on minimum reserves, but there are proposals for an increase in the minimum reserve requirement ratio at euro area level to reduce liquidity in the system. What is your view on this?     In July, we had a comprehensive discussion on the minimum reserve requirements and their remuneration. We came to the conclusion that, from a monetary policy perspective, it would be appropriate to keep them at a level of 1% but to remunerate them at 0% instead of applying the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. Let me stress three points.  First, our main tool for adjusting our monetary stance is our policy rates and not minimum reserve requirements. Second, minimum reserve requirements are linked to the volume of deposits, which means that they mainly affect banks with high holdings of deposits rather than those with high holdings of excess liquidity. Therefore, they tend to put a larger burden on smaller banks. Also, these higher reserve requirements may lead to “avoidance strategies” by banks, which could remunerate deposits by even less or shift them to entities outside the euro area, where there are no minimum reserve requirements. Lastly, we are currently discussing the design of our future operational framework for monetary policy implementation. As long as we do not know the role that minimum reserve requirements will play in this new framework, we should be cautious about making any far-reaching decisions.  In any case, the reduction of excess liquidity through the shrinking of our balance sheet will continue for some time and, eventually, all our asset purchase programmes will go into full run-off.   Economic growth prospects have worsened quite substantially, with the possibility of recession not being excluded from forecasts. What is your understanding of the drivers and the consequences of this recent deterioration in the business climate?  Over recent months, we have seen that most economic indicators point to a slowing growth momentum. We first saw a pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector, which started to spread to the services sector as the reopening effects from the pandemic faded. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for manufacturing are in deeply contractionary territory, and those for services are also signalling contraction. Consumer confidence has increased notably over the past year but remains at low levels. All this is pointing to subdued economic developments over the rest of this year.  While a technical recession cannot be excluded, there are no indications of a deep or prolonged downturn. One reason is the labour market, which is still quite resilient, resulting in strong nominal wage growth. As inflation falls, real incomes are rising, which supports economic growth going forward. What is clear is that our monetary policy will continue to have a dampening effect on economic growth.  So, there is no reason for concern of a deeper recession setting in?    We see indications of a period of stagnation but not of a deep or prolonged recession.  Still, the state of the economy in Germany, as a country that is a very important export market for many EU Member States, is not encouraging. How justified are the claims that Germany is currently the “sick man of Europe”?   Germany is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. Its economy has been hit twice: by the energy price shock and by weaker growth in China. This has exposed structural weaknesses linked to the dependence on cheap energy and on a booming economy in China that was eager to buy German manufacturing products. On top of this, Germany faces challenges regarding demographic developments, as it has a rapidly ageing society implying an increasing scarcity of labour, as well as the green transition which, as in many other countries, is facing political obstacles. Cyclical factors, i.e. weak domestic and foreign demand, will eventually fade, but the structural factors may weigh on potential growth and hence have longer-term effects. All this implies that  Germany, as is the case with many other countries, will need to adjust its business model to the changing global conditions, as well as to its domestic challenges.  How likely do you think that is?  Germany has managed to transform itself in the past and I am confident that it will be able to do so today. Naturally, this requires strategic thinking and openness to change. In particular, the green transition offers Germany vast opportunities to regain its technological leadership. The economy will pick up eventually, but the main issue concerns long-term potential growth, and that depends very much on how Germany tackles its structural challenges.  Arguments that the global economy is generally entering a phase of weak growth and disinflation are gaining ground. What do you see as having the most impact on inflation looking ahead?  What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics. When input costs rose sharply, many firms raised their prices in excess of the cost increase. So we saw an increase in profits in many sectors, also due to temporary supply-demand imbalances caused by bottlenecks and reopening effects. As a result of rising prices, employees experienced a drop in real wages. Now employees are trying to regain lost purchasing power, and tight labour market conditions are making it easier for the unions to negotiate higher wage increases. It is through such second-round effects that inflation becomes more persistent. The weakening of the economy, which is partly due to monetary policy transmission, makes it harder for firms to pass through higher wage costs to prices, meaning they may need to absorb higher costs through their profit margins. We see indications that this is happening. How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation, particularly underlying inflation, will be going forward.   There is a major difference of opinion as to how corporate profit margins over the last period have spurred inflation growth, with some analyses pointing to the conclusion that they were totally irrelevant.  Inflation is not only the result of rising wages or higher energy prices. Profits have also increased quite a lot over recent years. Looking ahead, the question is by how much wages will increase and to what extent rising wage costs will be absorbed by profit margins. It is only natural to expect that the unions and employees will try to regain some of the lost purchasing power and that wages will grow. But it is crucial how firms respond, and that depends on demand conditions and hence on our monetary policy.  Fiscal policy is expected to be prudent and cautious in order to curb inflation. However, politicians have their own concerns, such as a decline in the living standards of their citizens and in investment. On account of its widening fiscal deficit, Italy is again in the spotlight, and so is an increase in its bond yields. How does one reconcile these opposing goals?  We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years, which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures. However, we have also learnt over the years that consolidation should not come at the expense of necessary public investments. What really matters is the composition of public spending, which should aim to make the economy more productive and to strengthen the supply capacity. This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term. Therefore, it would be unwise to postpone public investments and structural reforms that are necessary to transform the economy. This is where the European funds come into play. The Next Generation EU programme can help countries to continue investing in their future. At the same time, the perception that the government can counter every economic shock through fiscal transfers is dangerous and could lead to unsustainable fiscal dynamics.    When it comes to recent yield movements in global financial markets, the largest part is driven by a general repricing of longer-term rates, as markets are anticipating interest rates to be held at a high level over a longer period of time. These higher funding costs imply that governments need to be even more prudent.  The ECB’s position that the price of borrowing will remain high for as long as necessary to reach the target inflation rate has been communicated quite clearly. Nevertheless, is there anything else that can be said in that context?     Our policy is data dependent, which implies that the level and duration of restrictive rates will depend on how the data develop. What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner. That is then also embedded in inflation expectations. One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly “anchored” around our target, in spite of painfully high inflation rates. Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.\n",
      "Content 17: INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Luis de Guindos,  of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold 2 October 2023  It’s been two weeks since the ECB raised rates for the tenth consecutive time, have you now done enough to tame inflation?  Let me stress an issue, which is sometimes slightly overlooked but is a very important part of the discussion, namely the transmission of monetary policy. That's crucial in order to understand the decisions that we have taken and those that we will take. In transmission you have two different legs. The first one is from our monetary policy decisions to financial markets and banks. In that first stage, the transmission is almost complete. You can see it. In the banking channel, there has been a tightening of financing conditions following our decisions. And there has been a significant drop in the demand for credit.  The second phase is how the impact of the tightening of financing conditions feeds through to the real economy. And here there is much more uncertainty. We have seen a slowdown in economic activity. But there are other factors behind that, for instance the impact of inflation on households’ disposable income and the evolution of exports, which is related to the slowdown in the global economy. The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy, and indirectly to inflation. That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates, if maintained over time, will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.   Do you worry about the risks of overdoing the tightening of monetary policy and driving the economy into an unnecessarily painful recession?   We do not at all want to create an unnecessarily painful recession. We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy. This is, at the end of the day, a very delicate balance. If the transmission is incomplete, then we should be a little more patient. If the transmission is much closer to completion, then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.   Does the recent rise in oil and gas prices, coupled with a weaker euro, make your task more difficult?   Yes, it makes our task more difficult. I would not say that it is a game changer. But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.   What would it take for the ECB to start cutting rates?   Well, we are not there.   But what would you need to see?   First of all, progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability, i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way. Starting to talk about rate cuts now is premature. We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Still, I think the last stretch is going to be more difficult. We are on our way towards 2 per cent. That’s clear. But we must monitor that very closely, as the last mile will not be easy.   But would the last mile be the hardest to achieve in bringing inflation down?  First let’s look at the factors in favour of disinflation. Base effects have an impact. Supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away. And there is monetary policy and the clear slowdown in the economy. In the second half of the year the economy in the euro area will have stagnated.  Now let’s turn to factors against disinflation. There’s a spike in oil prices. Wages are growing about 5 per cent on average. Demand for services is high, even though we have started to see a clear slowdown. And the euro has depreciated.  So, when you put all this in the balance, our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months. But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.   Are governments making inflation worse by continuing to run big deficits?   The first factor with respect to fiscal policy is the withdrawal of the subsidies granted over the last two years, which must be completed before the end of 2023. But it’s not only that. There is also the fiscal stance, which sometimes gets overlooked. My impression is that after four years without EU fiscal rules, governments may have got used to a little bit of a “whatever it takes” approach with respect to fiscal policy. But that has to change. Having a tightening of monetary policy and, simultaneously, an expansionary fiscal policy would be a very bad policy mix. And being more concrete, what would be detrimental is a fiscal deficit that goes above the level of 2022.   Does the ECB need to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system?   We are doing that. And this is totally normal in the process of normalisation of monetary policy. That is the correct pace, the correct path. TLTRO reached €2.1 trillion and now we are a little bit below €500 billion. And over the next year it will become close to zero.  What about stopping reinvestments in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme?  Some of my colleagues in the Governing Council have been quite outspoken with respect to the need for starting the process of quantitative tightening on the PEPP. But in the formal structure of the Council, we have not even started the discussion. It will arrive sooner or later.  Do you still need the flexibility of PEPP reinvestments as the first line of defence against financial market fragmentation, despite not having used it for two years?  If you ask the military, they will tell you that extra lines of defence are always good. Yes, we could use flexibility in the reimbursement of the PEPP to address fragmentation. It has not been used for two years because spreads are quiet. The PEPP is less than €2 trillion. Therefore, even doing a full run-off, the withdrawal of liquidity will not be huge. It is the first line of defence in times of volatility in markets, but that is not the case now. So, we’ll have to analyse it.  How about the banking system? Do you expect an increase in non-performing loans?  Return on European banks’ equity has clearly improved because of the widening of net interest margins after the increase in interest rates and it is now above 10%. Two years ago, it was around 4%. But banks’ valuations have not moved in parallel. Why? I think that the main reason is because the cost of equity of the European banks has increased quite a lot and it’s close to 15%. When interest rates increase, the cost of equity also goes up. Markets are also pricing in that the improvement in profitability will not be sustainable over time because they are factoring in an economic slowdown. And they price in that banks will have to increase provisions should non-performing loans levels go up.  This means profitability will be dented in the future. The current figures are a sort of illusion. In the pipeline, we start to see that the quality of the assets is deteriorating, and there’s an increase in non-performing loans. On top of that, taxes on bank profits have created some uncertainty.   Should countries not introduce bank taxes?   Not all bank taxes are identical. You have seen that in the case of Italy. The final proposal is much more sensible than the first one. Our point is very clear: these taxes should not impair credit and should not create any limitation in the capitalisation of European banks. This applies as well in terms of the banks being prudent in dividend payments and share buybacks, and even the remuneration of bankers.  Some members of the Governing Council would like to increase the minimum reserve requirements for the banks, on which you pay no interest. What do you think of that?  My opinion is that we should conduct monetary policy based on price stability, not on the profit and loss of national central banks. To reach price stability, you have to reduce liquidity. The reduction of liquidity will give rise to a reduction of these windfall profits that the commercial banks are getting at the moment because of increasing interest rates.   Are there any signs of distress in the property sector?   In commercial property there has been a very important decline in prices, mainly in some Nordic countries. The main problems have appeared in Sweden, Finland, the Nordic countries. But it’s quite pervasive. Residential real estate is more resilient. But, for instance, in the case of Germany, it was not a total surprise to see the recent data showing that house prices have declined by almost 10%. That’s a clear indication that there were some pockets of overvaluation that are going to be corrected. Our concern now are the non-banks, the property and mutual funds, that have a big exposure to real estate. I would say that commercial property – even though we also need to pay attention to residential property – is our main source of concern in terms of financial stability.\n",
      "Content 18: INTERVIEW  Interview with Market News International    Interview with Frank Elderson,  of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Luke Heighton on 22 September 2023  27 September 2023  Your speech at   Terschelling   was something of a departure for a central banker, in that it was clearly very personal, while at the same time seeking to counter a certain pessimism regarding attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Are you concerned that there isn’t sufficient buy-in at the moment from, as you put it, “those who pollute, those who finance the polluters, and those who supervise the financiers of the polluters”?  Looking back at the past five years, there are many things that clearly show we are not transitioning to a zero-emission economy fast enough, with all the problems that brings economically. On the other hand, many other things are going in the right direction. My main message was that we can do this, but we need to be fast. The later the transition, the higher the cost, as our recent economy-wide climate stress test has shown. So I might have used a little more pathos than I would have done if speaking here in Frankfurt, but the message is just as clear.  Is the ECB doing enough?   As supervisors we have a multi-year strategy. We published our expectations for climate-related and environmental risks in 2020. In 2021 we asked the banks to conduct self-assessments of where they stood vis-à-vis these expectations. On the basis of what we saw a year ago, the glass is slowly filling up, but it is not yet half full and it needs to be full by the end of 2024. I do see progress – banks are now better equipped to manage climate-related and environmental risks than when we made our initial assessments. Each of our expectations has been met at least once by a bank we supervise. The glass is filling up – but it is not yet full. Building on what the banks themselves found reasonable, we set a series of interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year, the second at the end of 2023 and the last – by which banks need to satisfy all our expectations – at the end of 2024. And we have said that we will use all our instruments to enforce these deadlines if needed.  Banks understand that we mean what we say and that this is within our mandate, because climate-related and environmental risks translate into financial risks which must be managed by the banks. This is also acknowledged worldwide. Although you do still see differences in how fast and how ambitious supervisors are, the fact of these risks being within their mandate is no longer controversial. That is a real step forward, and one which also reflects the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example.  But in that speech and others you’ve highlighted the urgency that’s required. Is that compatible with what is arguably still a very gradualist approach aimed, essentially, at trying to bring banks along with you, rather than you saying “you absolutely have to do this now, and if you don’t there will be consequences”?  First of all, ask the bankers. I don’t think that they would say that this is extremely gradual – many banks probably feel that we are pursuing this rather enthusiastically. There are clear deadlines − also interim deadlines − and we will enforce them if necessary. To be very clear, that includes periodic penalty payments. That’s not a step we take lightly, so I think that this shows how serious we are when we issue supervisory expectations. Do I particularly like that? Well, I believe it’s better to convince the banks. I know we’re asking a lot, and some banks would say it’s very difficult and claim that they can’t really do anything because they lack the data. But it is also true that the risks don’t become smaller just because they are difficult to measure. There is still a lot you can do short of perfection. But the risks are out there, and they will not wait until 2030 or 2050 to materialise – so we need to make real progress. Patchy data are better than no data at all. The same is true of the emerging art of climate modelling. Patchy climate models are better than nothing, but if you don’t even identify the gaps, you cannot really make progress towards filling them. There are many other things banks can do besides climate modelling, and we have also published a guide of best practices for banks that sets out these numerous options.  So looking at it from other directions, is there anything more that the ECB could, or should, be doing beyond compliance, such as making green investment more attractive? Might we one day see the green TLTROs (targeted longer-term refinancing operations) that commentators were discussing not so long ago?  Whereas up to now we’ve been speaking about what we are doing in our banking supervision, you are now asking a question about what we might consider in our monetary policy. Talking about possible future instruments is of course highly speculative, because whenever we design an instrument, we take into consideration all the circumstances of that particular moment. Any instrument needs to be effective to pursue our primary mandate of price stability, and it needs to be proportionate. It also depends on the environment – whether we are in a period of policy tightening or accommodation. But climate considerations are clearly part of the monetary policy strategy we adopted in 2021. I think it’s fair to assume that we will take climate considerations into account in the features of any type of instrument we may design in future − including any purchase programme.  In your speech you also mentioned the extent to which national governments subsidise fossil fuel industries. Obviously, there are limits to the ECB’s mandate, and maybe this is pushing those limits. But insofar as this issue constitutes a financial stability risk, can the ECB play a greater role? Or should it be left to private citizens to pursue the issue through the courts?  You’re talking to a lawyer, and the overriding requirement through all of this is that we act within our mandate. And when I talk to banks, I point out that we are seeing exponential growth in climate-related litigation. From our perspective, banks need to manage that risk at a time when there are certain cases in which the courts have endorsed rather far-reaching legal theories, including against states. It can no longer be taken for granted that those judgments will not be repeated or set a precedent, and that is something banks should be acutely aware of.  You said recently that there will be a just transition or no transition. Could you unpack that a little?  What I wanted to say there is that, if you look at what is happening in the world, it is clear that there is a risk of a growing antagonism – that the energy transition and climate crisis become politicised. All EU Member States have committed to becoming Paris Agreement-aligned. Not delivering on that, or postponing the transition, will lead to an economically suboptimal situation where the transition ends up being more costly. Our own analysis has also shown this time and again. Bringing attention to this issue is within our mandate.  If we could turn to monetary policy – In your last Governing Council meeting, the ECB raised interest rates again. For the final time in the cycle?  We have said it very clearly: we consider that, with the decisions we’ve made and on the basis of our current assessment, the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term. Does that mean policy rates have peaked? Not necessarily. There is still a lot of uncertainty. That’s why we take these decisions meeting by meeting, on a data-dependent basis. Making any predictions about what we will do next would not be consistent with that approach.  How do you see the balance of risks to the inflation outlook? Is it simply that the latest hike puts the ECB on a sounder footing by guarding against any additional upward price pressures?  I think that’s exactly what it is. Of course, there are upward risks to inflation. There could, for example, be upward pressures on food and energy prices – since July we have been alluding in our monetary policy statement to the importance of weather and climate conditions in this respect. Climate change could also lead to a shift in longer-term inflation dynamics, but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation. Helpful distinctions have also been proposed by my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Isabel Schnabel, analysing the impact of climate change itself, the ongoing dependency on fossil fuels and the green transition. Some aspects are certainly inflationary – 2022’s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67% compared with the year before, for example, so that’s rather significant. But it could also be the case that, over much longer horizons and depending on how the transition goes, energy will become much more abundant and cheaper.  Do you see any evidence that the current interest rate environment is having a negative effect on green investment?  Any interest rate decision has an effect on investment, both green and non-green. In the end, I think the best we can do is make sure that we deliver on our price stability mandate. That will create the stable environment in which the transition – including the required investment, which needs to be sped up – can take place.  How concerned are you about the growth outlook for the euro area? Or does the primary mandate of price stability ultimately matter more?  What we’re seeing is a more protracted period of sluggish growth than we were expecting. Of course, we need to look at the various explanatory factors, such as lower demand for euro area exports, the impact of tighter financing conditions, lower residential and business investment, and the weakening services sector. On the other hand, labour markets are still strong and disposable income is expected to rise, which would have a stabilising effect on overall GDP growth. It’s also true that our primary mandate is to deliver price stability, and I think we have proven we are very determined to do that, as seen in the ten rate hikes that we’ve decided on since July 2022.  So would you consider cutting rates if growth were to surprise significantly to the downside in the coming months?  I think I’ve explained very clearly how we take our decisions. We take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and we look at all the incoming data. We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments, and we will weigh any incoming data carefully, as always, in relation to our inflation outlook.  Would you need to see inflation clearly and consistently trending below 2% over the course of your medium-term projections before considering a cut appropriate? Equally, would reinvestments need to have stopped by that time?  Let me stick to what I have just said. As you know, we stand ready to adjust all our instruments as needed. Based on today’s assessments, we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target. We will keep rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.\n",
      "Content 19: INTERVIEW  Interview with Yahoo Finance   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Jennifer Schonberger  22 September 2023  You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?  Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.  So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?  So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.  So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?  Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.  As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?  I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.  You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?  Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.  Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?  This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.\n",
      "Content 20: INTERVIEW  Interview with The Currency   Interview with Philip R. Lane,  of the ECB, conducted by Stephen Kinsella on 31 August 2023 5 September 2023  Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?  We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.  In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?  Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.  Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.  Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.  I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?  I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing. This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.  I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.  I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?  Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.  Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.  I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?  Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.  Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.  Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?  I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.  I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?  The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.  Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?  Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.  Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?  We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.  We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic!  For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?\n"

      "Content 1: 7 February 2024  Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.\n",
      "Content 2: 3 February 2024  In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.\n",
      "Content 3: 31 January 2024  Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!\n",
      "Content 4: .de Frankfurt am Main, 22 January 2024 A Franco-German homage and appeal  As a young member of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble founded the Baden-Alsace discussion group together with the Mayor of Colmar, Joseph Rey. In his last ever campaign appearances, he supported pro-European parliamentary candidates in Alsace and Lorraine. Born during the war, raised in the French occupation zone, elected in the border region of southern Baden, friendship with France was close to his heart throughout his life – as the foundation for a strong Europe.  As a minister, Wolfgang Schäuble worked in close contact with his French counterparts. He was the first German finance minister to participate in a meeting of the French cabinet at the Élysée Palace. He formulated the aspiration to always take French and European interests into account: “If a solution is good for Europe, then it is good for Germany. And if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany”. German unity and European integration, open borders and joint security, a strong euro as a guarantee of stability – these fundamental convictions shaped his actions.  As President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, together with the then President of the French National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, spearheaded the establishment of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on 25 March 2019 in Paris; this joint chamber, comprising 50 German and 50 French members of parliament, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both Presidents had previously signed the Franco-German Parliamentary Accord, which – some 56 years after the Élysée Treaty – adds a parliamentary dimension to the Franco-German friendship as an intergovernmental agreement, thus raising it to a completely new level. None of this would have been possible without Wolfgang Schäuble’s impassioned efforts alongside his colleague in Paris.  Even in his last interview – published on 24 December 2023, just two days before he passed away – Wolfgang Schäuble called for reviving the Weimar Triangle as a “German-Polish-French engine for Europe” and strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities: “Let’s follow this European path. Only by working together can Europe play an economic, military and environmental role in the world.“  That is his legacy. And that is why the state memorial ceremony in his honour is quite rightly taking place on 22 January, “Franco-German Day” – exactly 61 years after the signing of the Élysée Treaty and six years to the day since Wolfgang Schäuble became the first President of the Bundestag to address the French National Assembly on 22 January 2018. In that speech he described the Franco-German friendship as \"a gift from history\", but one owed to the vision of courageous people who, after the world wars and the crimes committed by Germany, showed the way to reconciliation. Wolfgang Schäuble said: “What has been achieved inspires us to move forward” and added “Let us use the freedom we enjoy today. Let us live up to our responsibilities as courageously as the original signatories. Together! ”  Wolfgang Schäuble more than lived up to these responsibilities, and did so honestly and tirelessly. Yet the state memorial ceremony in the German Bundestag with Emmanuel Macron is more than just a tribute to great merit. It is a mission and an appeal. It is a mission entrusted to us, as leaders in politics and society, to bring the European vision to life in a spirit of close partnership. And it is an appeal to young people to keep enthusiastically pursuing the idea of Europe. Peace, freedom and friendship cannot be taken for granted, we have to work for them again and again. As for European integration, it is far from complete and must continue to be shaped, with determination – and by those who are truly European at heart, as was Wolfgang Schäuble.  We will honour Wolfgang Schäuble's memory with immense gratitude for his life's work. We pay tribute to a great German, a great friend of France and a great European. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Wolfgang Schäuble.\n",
      "Content 5: 13 January 2024    The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?  The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.  Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.  The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.   What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?  The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.  Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.   Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?  Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.   The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?  I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.  It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.  Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?  For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.  Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?  The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.   Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?  For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.  Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?   We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.   There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?  Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.  Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?  That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.  EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?   A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.  Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?  We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.  Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?  It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.\n",
      "Content 6: 10 January 2024 Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% inflation is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: \"central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s\". Yet, we have seen how inflation has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the \"normal mechanism\" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of \"austrian\" or \"hard-money\" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As inflation falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about inflation reacceleration or does the link between Growth/Inflation (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Inflation has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on inflation in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee inflation reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to inflation as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling inflation raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying inflation are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that inflation is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and inflation. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly disinflationary before the pandemic and inflationary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of inflationary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our inflation target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average inflation after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act inflation after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average inflation?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, inflation will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term inflation and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or inflation.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and inflation is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core inflation above 2% for the entire year. At which level inflation would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that inflation sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the disinflationary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate inflation BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see inflation returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect inflation to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Does the ECB take into account the asymmetries that are produced from its policies due to the fact that the EZ is not a proper monetary union? Do you think it should/shouldn't? Thank you   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further steps in European integration would clearly benefit our single monetary policy. Therefore we need to make further progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union. #AskECB    @ecb   Why would any Country give up their sovereign currency knowing that money can be printed instead of borrowed ? The US,UK,Can... have retained their sovereignty, they are in a better situation to react to \"shocks\" in the economy. natural or man made.   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro area countries have decided to give up their own currencies and join the euro. A currency union reduces transaction costs and facilitates trade by removing exchange rate risks. The euro enjoys wide support in all member countries. #AskECB   Also, how far can BVB go in the Champions League this season?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: All the way! #AskECB  Time to wrap up for today. Many thanks for your questions – I really enjoyed our chat! Take care, @Isabel_Schnabel #AskECB\n",
      "Content 7: INTERVIEW  Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit   Tribute article on Wolfgang Schäuble for Die Zeit by Christine Lagarde,  of the ECB  3 January 2024 When I think of Wolfgang Schäuble, the first image I see is him sitting across from me at the table of the French cabinet in the Élysée Palace, the first German finance minister to participate in such a meeting. I see him sitting at the negotiating table in Brussels, at one of our many meetings that ran long into the night. I hear the straight talker who never shied away from difficult decisions. I remember the dedicated public servant, a master of diplomacy with the intellectual ability to understand opposing viewpoints. I see a natural statesman with the courage to stand by his convictions as well as the pragmatism to recognise the world as it is. And I see a man of loyalty and kindness.  The recent passing of my dear friend and colleague saddens me deeply, and my heart goes out to his family. Yet I take comfort in remembering his remarkable achievements for Europe. I recall his own words in this regard because they capture his clear commitment to both Germany and Europe: “If a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.” Few have done as much for Germany and Europe over such a long period as Wolfgang, with his more than half a century of public service. As minister of the interior, he was at the heart of Germany’s reunification process. It was a moment of profound change for the country and for all Europeans, and one that had to be handled with great care in view of the sensitivities of neighbouring countries to German history. Wolfgang understood that one of the best ways for Germany to demonstrate its responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours. That was no small matter in a nation so proud of the Deutsche Mark. But he knew that a single currency would bind Europe together and protect the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations, and that this was in Germany’s and in Europe’s best interests. When Europe’s sovereign debt crisis came, Wolfgang was a calming influence, reminding us that the euro is much more than just a currency. His defence of Europe was unwavering and absolute. Nevertheless, he was always self-reflective, and later asked himself how things could have been done differently, potentially causing less suffering. Wolfgang’s intellectual rigour stemmed from his ability to combine the subtlety of a diplomat with the attention to detail of a lawyer. It was a quality that put him at the forefront of discussions in the 1990s on how to build a more deeply integrated European framework.  His statesmanship would have been welcome in today’s challenging environment of extreme views. His success did not come through a forceful personality, but from understanding how to find common ground with others. This approach has served Germany and Europe well. In my experience, Wolfgang’s philosophy was consistent: stay true to yourself and to your democratic institutions. Now is a timely moment to remember that as we remember him. I will miss my dear friend, and the birthday flowers he sent me over many years!\n",
      "Content 8: 22 December 2023    Inflation has recently fallen to 2.4%, more rapidly than expected. Are you satisfied?    We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2%. We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term, as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire, such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services. We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2% by 2025.  So, we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.   But you do want to go the last mile?  We must go the last mile: we have an inflation target of 2%.   Would 2.1% not be enough?  We want to return to 2% on a sustainable basis.   There is war in Ukraine and Gaza. How much do global crises influence the central bank’s work?   Geopolitical shocks lead to uncertainty and thereby affect economic decisions. At the same time, they can also push up energy prices and hit world trade by disrupting supply chains – which we see happening in the Red Sea right now. Geopolitics can also influence the green transition, if the supply of commodities, such as those required for producing solar cells or batteries, is restricted for political ends. All of this affects our core business: the fight against inflation.   Your policy rate decisions are data-dependent, as you always emphasise. How useful are historical data to you when, as at present, the global situation is constantly changing fundamentally?  Historical data are valuable as one can derive patterns from them. But the world can change very quickly. We then need to adjust our analyses, without discarding historical knowledge. The macroeconomic environment has indeed changed radically over the past few years. We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then – owing to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine – quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation. Looking at the period of low interest rates would hardly help. But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.   Inflation was very low in the past decades. Was that mainly because of the central banks’ sound monetary policy? Or was it partly luck, thanks to globalisation for example?   It was both. After the great inflation of the 1970s, monetary policy changed fundamentally. Central banks have become more independent and have a clearer mandate: price stability. This has increased the credibility of monetary policy. But there have also been macroeconomic trends, particularly globalisation and China’s entry into the world market, which played an important role and brought down inflation.  Has the fight for stable prices got tougher?   Since 2020 there have been several severe external shocks. That makes monetary policy more challenging.   Will inflation be higher in future than it was before?   Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2%. At the same time, we may be confronted with more supply-side shocks. And these could turn out to be inflationary, even though that is hard to predict. Climate change, for example, drives prices, we see that already. Extreme weather can push up food prices, low water levels in the Panama Canal increase transportation costs, and carbon taxes raise the price of fossil fuels. A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well. But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence, which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.   When you joined the Executive Board in 2020 you wanted to smooth the fractious relationship between Germans and the ECB. Did you manage to do so?   The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB. It has enabled us to strengthen the ECB’s credibility.   But the ECB was too slow in combating inflation. Many people haven’t forgotten that.     We acted relatively late, but all the more decisively. We sharply increased interest rates within a short time, and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation. Inflation was initially caused by rising energy prices and disrupted supply chains owing to the pandemic and the war. These constrained aggregate supply, while demand remained robust. Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations. We succeeded in doing that. It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2%.   Inflation has fallen, but the higher prices continue to put pressure on people.  The prices are clearly higher than before the pandemic, and monetary policy cannot roll back that increase. And people would not be better off if we plunged the economy into years of deep recession just to bring the prices back to their old levels.  Would you manage, though?  With massive consequences, but this is not the task of monetary policy. An energy price shock makes an economy that is reliant on energy imports poorer overall. Somebody has to bear those losses.  When you have achieved your 2% inflation target, is there a risk of forgetting that the high level of prices is as good as entrenched now?  We target inflation, not the price level. Also in the past, it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.  The quick and sharp interest rate hikes have led to banks suddenly making record profits. Is this fair?  Our decisions are guided by our price stability mandate. But they have side effects, including their impact on bank profits. Banks have lent money at higher rates, but they have not passed the higher interest rates on to their depositors immediately or in full. But we expect banks’ profits to be under more pressure in the future because banks will face higher funding costs and rising credit default risks, while lending is weakening. Banks would therefore be well-advised to use these short-term profits to build up a buffer against future losses.  But banks tend not to do that, opting to pay out dividends instead. Erring on the side of caution would certainly not hurt the banks.  The high profits are also boosted by the 4% deposit facility rate which banks receive on their excess reserves. The ECB could shrink these deposits by raising the minimum reserve requirement. Why has it not done so?  In July we decided to no longer remunerate the minimum reserves while keeping the minimum reserve requirement at 1% of the minimum reserve base, which consists mainly of customer deposits. The minimum reserve requirement is not an effective way of compensating the remuneration of excess liquidity. Large banks have the highest excess liquidity, smaller banks have less. At the same time, the smaller banks are mostly funded by deposits. This is why they would be disproportionally affected by higher minimum reserve requirements.  By the same token, large banks are subsidised with the deposit rate, because many smaller lenders only have low excess amounts that are remunerated.  Banks are not subsidised. But the effects of our measures do vary. For example, during the pandemic the ECB granted longer-term loans that have strongly benefited smaller banks. At the same time, until recently banks were charged a negative interest for their excess liquidity, and that affected large banks more. There are no banks that are systematically at an advantage or a disadvantage. All banks are important for the transmission of monetary policy.  The ECB could sell all the sovereign bonds – that would solve the excess reserve problem. The ECB’s balance sheet has already shrunk significantly. This will continue in the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity. But the primary monetary policy instrument is ECB policy rates. The reduction of our balance sheet is happening gradually in the background, also to avoid market turbulence. While we are not expecting any, we are not taking any risks.  The ECB is making losses now because it has to pay high interest to banks while holding low-yielding bonds. A central bank that is making losses doesn’t look too good.  Our bond purchases were always guided by monetary policy considerations. Take the pandemic emergency purchase programme. This measure probably averted a serious financial crisis that would have wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s lives. The ECB’s losses cannot be viewed out of context.  But they do damage your reputation.  We always assess whether our measures are proportionate, and losses can damage the central bank’s credibility and independence. In the future, this might lead to a certain reassessment of bond purchases.  How do you assess the ECB’s bond purchases?  Bond purchases can be employed for achieving two distinct goals: price stability on the one hand, and market stabilisation on the other. They were very successful in stabilising the financial markets. But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation. At the time, one problem was the very restrictive fiscal policy. Governments failed to make use of the low interest rate period to invest, and this made life difficult for monetary policy.  The lesson here is that fiscal and monetary policy need to pull together.  When you joined the ECB in 2020, inflation was low, the key interest rate below zero and central banks were making profits. This has all changed. How has it affected you?  I have learnt that the world can change much more quickly than you think. The central bank needs to react swiftly in such situations, and this is a challenge. But I think that we have done pretty well in the past four years.\n",
      "Content 9: 21 December 2023  Wage cost data in Spain point to an increase of 4.7%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that domestic inflation is resisting and is largely predicated by wages. Do you think wage moderation is required to beat inflation?  A year ago inflation was above 10% and now it is below 3%. Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable, i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation, basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade, and because monetary policy is taking effect. However, average wage growth in the euro area is over 5%, whereas productivity is barely improving. This means that unit labour costs are rising, which adds to inflationary pressures. In 2022 profit margins increased considerably, but this year the increase has been more moderate. This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs, which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.   What will the ECB do in this situation?  We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins, as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2% target. We are keeping a very close eye on this.  The EU is emerging from this crisis better than it did in 2008. What do you think has changed?  We have the experience of what happened in 2008 and the two crises are completely different. The 2008 crisis broke out on the back of extremely high private sector debt levels, which had a significant impact on the banking sector. The response was also very different. For the crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic, there have been no limits to fiscal policy, and this has been accompanied by monetary policy that has also been very expansive. In addition to this, the European Union came up with an action plan for all countries throughout the bloc, providing them with funding through the Next Generation EU programme.  However, the situation has now changed. Almost all income indicators have returned to their pre-pandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation. To this end, the ECB takes action through its monetary policy but we also need to see fiscal policy return to normal.   With euro area inflation at 2.4% in November and euro area GDP stagnating for the past twelve months, how do you explain to people why interest rates are being kept so high?   Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do, which is bring inflation down. Monetary policy operates by tightening financing conditions: higher interest rates affect levels of economic activity. And when economic activity is dampened, inflation slows. Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2%, monetary policy might then start to ease. But it’s still too early for that to happen.   When can we expect to see the first interest rate cuts?   If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time, current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2%. We are data dependent. The data have been favourable but still not enough for us to change our monetary policy. It’s therefore too early to talk about a cut in interest rates.  What do you think about opinions from certain quarters that the ECB is sort of following in the slipstream of the US Federal Reserve?  The US economy’s fundamentals and cycles differ from Europe’s. US fiscal policy has been much more expansive, growth is higher and the rate of unemployment, below 4%, is even lower than in the euro area. With an unemployment rate of 6.5%, our labour market is in good shape, but on the whole the economies are in different situations. As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, what the Federal Reserve does is relevant, but it does not determine the ECB’s monetary decisions.  Do you think that now is the time for completing banking union? This debate always seems to be ongoing but never seems to reach a conclusion.  Completing the banking union is essential if we want full economic and monetary union in Europe. There is one pillar missing: a European deposit insurance scheme. European elections will be held in June 2024, offering another opportunity for this. Completing banking union should be on the future European Commission’s agenda, as should making progress on a fiscal union through the introduction of a common fiscal stabilisation function.  Do you think there is the risk of a recession if, for example, the war in Ukraine drags on?   The ECB does not expect a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But beyond whether or not a recession will occur, the main issue is that Europe’s economy has a structural growth problem. Both our projections and those of the European Commission see very moderate growth of around 1% up until 2026. These potential growth levels are low because productivity is barely improving. Europe needs to import more energy than other global economies. As a result, the energy crisis further exacerbates its competitiveness issues. Structural reforms are therefore necessary. The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, but to achieve growth, other factors must be brought into play.  What would these reforms have to be?  One would be completing banking union, as I mentioned. Clear progress also needs to be made towards the capital markets union, and also in the single market of the European Union. Not much is said about the latter, but we are in a situation where there are hardly any limits on state aid, which creates imbalances between countries, depending on their fiscal position. The focus basically needs to be on Europe's low growth potential, how to increase productivity and the reforms needed to boost growth in the medium term.  Do you think it would be feasible to standardise the formula for the European Union’s Next Generation funds?  The Next Generation funds were a response to the pandemic and had two very positive aspects: the issuance of joint debt and the fact that part of the aid consisted of grants rather than loans. Beyond the clearly positive effects of the programme, it ultimately highlights that we need to complete our economic and monetary union. And to do so it is vital to have a permanent centralised fiscal policy instrument, and to implement structural reforms.  Staying with the European Union, there was an agreement on fiscal rules yesterday. How does the ECB see it?   Markets are calm and interest rates on sovereign debt have even fallen. But this can change relatively quickly in the context of low growth, tight monetary policy and geopolitical risks. That is why it is very important to have a clear framework of common fiscal rules. We welcome that there's an agreement because that reduces uncertainty in the markets.  And what is the ECB calling for?  Our recommendation is that the framework should be simple, transparent, easy to understand and countercyclical. In other words, it should allow fiscal policy to be expansionary in bad times and contractionary in good times. Fiscal action plans need to ensure a prudent and sustained reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in structural deficits. They should also create fiscal space for public investment in digitalisation, climate change or defence, and should provide incentives for structural reforms.  In the end, would you say that the EU has completely ditched austerity?  Sometimes it is not clear what is meant by “austerity”. Fiscal sustainability is essential, and, at the same time, fiscal rules have to allow for countercyclical action. And to be able to increase the public deficit during an economic downturn, countries need to rebuild their fiscal positions and reduce their public deficit when the going is good. Beyond fiscal policy, one basic difference between the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis was the very different monetary policy response, providing liquidity to banks and launching a pandemic asset purchase programme that has ultimately provided immense support to the European economy.  Do you think southern European countries have learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis?  Banking systems are much healthier than they were in the period from 2008 to 2011. And that is a key change. Moreover, these countries have made efforts to become more competitive and have a balance of payments surplus. For example, Greece and Portugal have made very significant budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in the risk premia and the ratings agencies. Many southern European countries have made considerable efforts to improve the sustainability of their public finances in the medium term. That is why it makes no sense to now try to create some kind of north-south divide between EU countries.   One of the most important projects the ECB is currently working on is a digital euro. How is it going and what are its key components?  At the moment, we all have euro banknotes in our wallets. A digital euro would be exactly the same, just on our mobiles. It would basically be the banknotes we have now, but in digital form and also backed by the central bank. We want it to be an additional, alternative means of payment. It is not meant to replace banknotes but to complement them. There would also be a limit on the amount of digital euro you can hold. In other words, it would be a means of payment but not a means of saving. We want a digital euro to be more comparable to banknotes than current accounts.  Do you share the Government’s optimism about the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy has a healthy banking system, which is completely different to how the situation was in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the economy is competitive, with a surplus in the balance of payments. It is important that both are maintained in the future. The external sector, including international tourism, has helped a lot in restoring income to pre-pandemic levels.   Are there any challenges?  Education still needs some work. This affects medium- and long-term growth because there are mismatches between labour supply and demand. The 12% unemployment rate means there is room for improvement in the labour market. Like some other euro area countries, Spain has a high public debt-to-GDP ratio of 110%. It is therefore important that these countries implement a prudent adjustment programme to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP.  All countries are going to face major challenges: economic slowdown, geopolitical risks, a new framework of fiscal rules or higher interest rates. That is why economic policy must be predictable.  The last two questions have a Spanish context. What do you think about Nadia Calviño’s appointment as the next president of the European Investment Bank?   Naturally, as a Spaniard, I think it is positive that Spaniards hold key positions in the European Union. I wish her and the institution all the very best.   And in the same vein, particularly seeing as you have held the post that Calviño now leaves, who would you like to see occupy the position left vacant by her?  It is not my place to comment on domestic affairs. I am sure whoever is appointed will be competent and I wish them every success.\n",
      "Content 10: 5 December 2023  What is your take on the unexpectedly benign November inflation reading? Does the recent string of downside surprises change your view about the inflation trajectory?  “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” I’m sure you know this famous quote that is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly. This was due to the reversal of the previous supply side shocks and was mainly driven by energy and food prices. Base effects played a significant role. The November flash release was a very pleasant surprise. Most importantly, underlying inflation, which has proven more stubborn, is now also falling more quickly than we had expected. This is quite remarkable. All in all, inflation developments have been encouraging. That said, despite these positive developments, I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely. We continue to expect an uptick over the coming months. There’s going to be a reversal of some fiscal measures and of some base effects, and we cannot exclude that there’s going to be a new price spike in energy or food. Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2% target. Our monetary policy is working. The restrictive policy is contributing to dampening growth in aggregate demand. Economic growth has been weak over the past several quarters, and it’s expected to remain weak this quarter before gradually picking up next year. This period of below-potential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2%. So, I believe we are on track, but we need to remain vigilant.  Are we still on the inflation path you outlined in your September projections?  Let’s see what our December staff projections are going to show. But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2% no later than 2025. This is our main objective.  What is your assessment of growth since the September projections?   Some of the hard data we see are not very good. But some of the soft data are giving us hope. The purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) seem to be bottoming out and they’re even showing a small uptick. Of course, this is from very low levels. But it is in line with our projections. Growth is then expected to pick up gradually next year, mainly due to rising real incomes, which should foster confidence and consumption. All this will depend, to a large extent, on the development of the labour market, which has been very resilient. We have seen that firms have held on to their labour force in spite of weakening economic growth. This is only sustainable if they expect growth to pick up. If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market, this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process. But while we do see some softening in the labour market, we do not expect a significant deterioration or a deep and prolonged recession.  Do you see a risk that the rapid drop in credit demand could exacerbate the downturn?  What we’re seeing is that monetary policy transmission is working. There has been a sharp increase in lending rates and a strong slowdown in loan growth. This is exactly what we wanted to see.  Markets are pricing an early spring rate cut but the ECB has guided for steady rates for several quarters. How do you view this discrepancy?  Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year. Central banks are more cautious, and I would argue they have to be more cautious. After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution. If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a sustainable manner. This should happen no later than 2025.  According to our staff projections, the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame. Transmission is working – lending growth is slowing, the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing. We are right on track. But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation. The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum. We now need to see whether this is sustained. We’ve seen very strong wage growth and weak or even falling productivity, leading to a sharp increase in the growth of unit labour costs. This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular, which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained. We’re going to watch upcoming wage agreements very closely. This will certainly also matter for our monetary policy decisions.  If the current level of restriction is sufficient, does that mean you do not see a need for further rate increases?  The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.  What is sufficiently long? Do you also see several quarters of steady rates?  We need to see more data. There’s first likely going to be an uptick in inflation. So, this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now. And most importantly, we need to see what’s going to happen to underlying inflation, to wage growth, to productivity, to unit profits. In order to be confident that we will sustainably return to our target, we need more time.  Am I reading it correctly that you’re not ruling out a rate cut before mid-year then?  We remain data dependent. That’s the main thing. We have to see what’s going to happen. We have been surprised many times in both directions. So, we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months’ time.   What is your view on the timeframe for ending pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments?  As President Lagarde mentioned, the Governing Council is going to discuss reinvestments under the PEPP in the not-too-distant future and I’ll leave it up to you to interpret what that means. It’s clear that discussion is going to come. It’s also clear that at some point we’re going to fully end PEPP reinvestments. The amounts involved are relatively small and markets are expecting this to happen, so I think it’s not such a big deal.  Am I correctly reading the mood that even if reinvestments end, there is no appetite for outright sales of bonds in either the asset purchase programme (APP) or PEPP portfolios?  We have never discussed outright sales.  You gave a speech in March in which you made the case for a demand-driven system for the ECB’s new operational framework. How has you thinking evolved since?  What I said in that speech is that a demand-driven system is well-suited for a heterogeneous currency union that may be prone to fragmentation. Such a system also likely limits the size of the central bank balance sheet. Of course, it can be designed in many different ways. What we are doing in our framework review is trying to find a system that implements our monetary policy effectively and efficiently in a way that minimises the negative side effects. So, the new system has to take into account the specificities of the euro area financial system. It has to be firmly embedded in our legal framework and it should limit our market footprint. But one should be aware that we are starting from a situation of abundant excess liquidity. So whatever framework we choose, money market rates will initially remain close to the floor.  What is the timeline for the balance sheet to shrink to its optimal size?   That depends on various factors that we can’t project perfectly. It also depends on the framework that we will eventually choose. One of the main drivers of the size of the central bank balance sheet is the growth of what we call autonomous factors – banknotes and official sector deposits – and the growth of reserve requirements. These factors already imply that the balance sheet is going to be around three times as large as before the global financial crisis.  In addition, banks could have a higher demand for excess liquidity for regulatory or precautionary reasons. If the outcome of the review was a demand-driven system, the size of the balance sheet would thus also depend on banks’ demand for excess liquidity. This would mean the size would not be determined by us, which is a good thing, because we don’t know precisely what the demand is.  The Federal Reserve has gone with the floor system. Could two of the world’s biggest central banks operate with different frameworks?  I do not see any problem with that. If you look around the world, you see many different frameworks.  The Fed has a supply-driven floor, the Bank of England a demand-driven floor, and Sveriges Riksbank a narrow corridor, while many central banks in emerging markets have a classical corridor. So, there is a wide variety of models out there that are tailor-made for specific financial systems.    Do you see the need for a structural portfolio of bonds and/or longer-term bank loans? What would the size of such a portfolio need to be?    I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of the framework review. There are different ways to provide liquidity to the financial system and all of them are going to be discussed in the review. We are going to weigh up the benefits and costs of each of them, and it could make sense to have a mix of different tools. We need to keep in mind, though, that this only matters far out in the future, because we are starting from a situation where we have a huge monetary policy bond portfolio. The structure of the balance sheet only becomes relevant when it has to grow again. As regards a structural portfolio, I mentioned in my March speech that this could be considered. Also keep in mind that we de facto already have a structural portfolio because some national central banks are holding bonds in their Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) portfolios.  What do you mean by “far out in the future”? Could it be next decade?  That depends on the decisions we are going to take. If we decided on both longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio, we would have to think about a potential split. But this really depends on many factors and I do not want to make any predictions. What is clear is that the balance sheet has to be much larger than it was before the global financial crisis. But, for all the frameworks under consideration, the balance sheet is going to be much smaller than it is now.  Should the ECB introduce new longer-term refinancing operations?  We will discuss the different options available to provide liquidity to the banks, including longer-term operations. But such a facility would have to be different from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) we were offering during the pandemic, in that it would have to be offered at market rates. From the banks’ perspective, longer-term lending operations are attractive because they provide a certain reliability of funding. And they reach all parts of the banking sector directly. That is very different from asset purchases – when you inject liquidity, it typically ends up with the larger banks and in certain financial centres.  Do you see a case for increasing the minimum reserve requirements, as some of your colleagues advocate?  We had a discussion on minimum reserve requirements in July and we discussed both the calibration and the remuneration. We decided to keep the minimum reserve requirements at 1% but to remunerate them at zero, instead of at the deposit facility rate. The reason for this was proportionality. With this change, we can implement our monetary policy stance in the same way and equally effectively while paying lower interest to the banks. That was the justification for reducing the remuneration. The proportionality argument implies that, if we have two options and one of them leads to losses while the other is just as effective in achieving price stability but reduces these losses, then we should choose the option that generates smaller losses. But let me stress that the minimum reserve requirements are not a tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. They also have distributional effects – they have the greatest impact on the banks with the highest deposit base, which tend to be the smaller banks. We are going to discuss the role of minimum reserve requirements in the operational framework review. And until then, we will not take any decisions.  To what extent should profit and loss considerations matter for monetary policy decisions?  Our monetary policy decisions are determined by our mandate. Profit and loss considerations matter only insofar as they affect our credibility and, consequently, our ability to pursue our mandate.  Andrea Enria argued recently that shadow banks need closer scrutiny, and the ECB could theoretically conduct this supervision. If the ECB supervised them, it could also provide them with access to liquidity facilities. Is that needed?  The experience of the pandemic shows that we are able to distribute liquidity across the financial sector without giving non-banks direct access to our balance sheet. At the moment we are not considering opening up our balance sheet to non-banks because there is no clear case for that.\n",
      "Content 11: 29 November 2023  Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.   What would you say to those who think that banks are making excessive profits?   The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, which has just been published, indeed shows that bank profitability has risen sharply. This improvement can be attributed to the widening of interest rate margins. The return on equity of euro area banks now stands at around 10%, whereas in 2019, barely five years ago, it stood at 4%. So it has clearly improved.  Still, this is something of an illusion − it is after all a short-term improvement. In the long term, we expect profitability to fall again. Why? There are several factors. First, the economy is slowing, which will lead to higher default rates and a decline in asset quality. Second, banks will have to pay more to attract deposits. On term accounts, for example, interest rates have already risen sharply. Likewise, the bonds that banks issue themselves will need to carry a higher return. So overall the cost of bank funding is on the rise. And finally, an often-overlooked factor is that demand for credit is falling. Putting all that together, you can see that high bank profitability is not sustainable. In fact, the financial markets are already convinced of this, as bank share valuations are in no way reflecting expectations of high profits.  Are the banks sufficiently covered for interest rate risks. If not, could the regulator, the ECB, review its requirements?   The interest rate risk of European banks can’t be compared to that run by some US banks such as Silicon Valley Bank with a different business model. The repricing of loans, in other words, raising interest rates in line with the market rate, has been much faster than the repricing of deposits in Europe. However, the interest rates on deposits will also increase at some point.  So is interest rate risk adequately covered?  Yes, but at the same time banks will be facing a loss of profitability as I said. I am talking about the average for the sector.   There has been a lot of debate about interest rates on savings. Politicians are taking initiatives to get banks to raise interest rates. Is that a good idea?  If the ECB raises interest rates, it is for borrowers and savers. Lending rates have risen and the remuneration of deposits is expected to follow suit. The remuneration on savings accounts should reflect our interest rates. That is part of our monetary policy transmission. Because if savings become more attractive, consumers will spend less, reducing demand. This is what we aim for to push down inflation. However, we now see banks are delaying passing on higher interest rates to savers. They can do that because they still benefit from abundant liquidity right now. But we are also taking measures to reduce excess liquidity, so that higher interest rates on savings accounts will become a reality – sooner or later.  Do you see differences between member states in this respect?  Yes, there are differences. In some countries, banks are quick to adjust interest rates on deposits, and in others, such as Spain, they are lagging behind. Euro area banking sectors also differ in the way mortgage loans are granted, whether it is at variable or fixed rates. Strengthening of profitability was particularly notable for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates and the pass-through of higher policy rates to deposits has been slower.  And Belgium?  I know the Spanish situation because it’s my own country, but we look at euro area averages and developments as a whole.  Some economists criticise the system that allows banks to make money easily by depositing their excess liquidity with the ECB. This is resulting in generous profits at the moment because interest rates are rising. What’s your take on this?  The ECB has raised its interest rates with a view to these increases being passed on to all remuneration categories in bank balance sheets. The level of liquidity in the market was extremely high and had to be reduced. This reduction is under way now and will go hand-in-hand with a decline in these types of revenues for banks.  You have also changed the remuneration of the minimum reserve requirement for banks. Some bankers believe that this should be raised to ensure a stronger capital base. Do you think that’s a good idea?  We have indeed set the remuneration of banks’ minimum reserves to 0%. The levels of those reserves have so far not been changed or discussed. I know some central bank governors are in favour of increasing them. We have limited the remuneration on the minimum reserve requirement, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of banks’ liabilities. I understand that remuneration of reserves is important for some banks, but monetary policy shouldn’t be driven by the financial position of banks or the profits of the central banks. Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.  National central banks are going to have to report significant losses owing to the policy of quantitative easing, which led to huge purchases of sovereign bonds to inject liquidity into the market. Do these losses pose a problem?  It’s true that central banks are currently reporting losses owing to the hike in interest rates, but if we look at a longer period of time, for instance over the last 10 years, the net outcome is positive in terms of central bank profits.  What about the real estate market? People are complaining about the higher cost of loans. What would you say to them?   What is happening is part of our monetary policy. The sharp rise in interest rates is starting to dampen real estate prices. This is more apparent in some countries than others, but a moderation in price trends can be seen everywhere. On average, house prices are stabilising. The decline in commercial property prices is much more pronounced.   Does the situation pose a danger?   It could affect banks, but fortunately they are less exposed to commercial real estate than they are to residential real estate. Commercial real estate is more often financed through other channels, such as mutual funds. But in the financial system there is a high degree of interconnectedness, so we look at the overall picture.  Huge investments are needed to make homes and other buildings climate-proof. Are the higher interest rates delaying funding for investments aimed at combating climate change? Could that slow down the climate transition?  It’s true that substantial investments are needed, but I think they should mainly be financed through subsidies and European funds like the Next Generation EU. This is a matter for fiscal policy. That doesn’t alter the fact that the ECB conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing rates without discriminating between sectors or borrowers.   Monetary policy also affects the climate transition in other ways. Some investments are being jeopardised by higher financing costs. This has already resulted in plans for various wind farms being scrapped.  The ECB pays close attention to climate policy, but for us it’s a secondary objective. It’s national governments that play the leading role in climate policy, through taxes and subsidies. We can contribute though – and we do. For example, we prioritise climate-friendly companies in our corporate bond portfolio. This is a small contribution, but it sends a clear signal in the fight against climate change.  The ECB is preparing to introduce a digital euro. Why is that necessary?  We currently have a physical euro in our wallets, whereas the world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. There is a very natural evolution taking place from a physical to a digital euro backed by the central bank. We see the digital euro as a means of payment. We would be able to use this form of public money to pay for our shopping, our bill in a restaurant or all sorts of purchases. Like banknotes, the digital euro will not have to be remunerated. There will be a limit on the amount of digital euro people can hold, to avoid endangering the stability of the banking system. This means that the digital euro won’t compete with current accounts. That is a very clear message we want to send to the banking sector. The digital euro will not be an investment product but a simple means of payment to complement banknotes.  Won’t implementing the digital euro be very expensive for the ECB?  This will be part of our calculations during the preparation phase over the next two years, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted but, in my view, the benefits will outweigh the costs. It will offer another alternative means of payment to those living in the euro area. It will also enable us to take another step towards European strategic autonomy. And at the end of the preparation phase the decision will be taken by the European Commission, the European Council of the European Union and European Parliament.  A number of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, are struggling with how inflation is measured. The way it’s measured means actual inflation is sometimes overestimated and sometimes underestimated. Isn't that a problem for the ECB, as it’s tasked with fighting inflation?  Indeed, changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated. But that's a matter for Eurostat, not the ECB, and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward. Statistical changes to the compilation of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) occur from time to time. A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not. As you know, that was one of the conclusions of our monetary policy strategic review. We work and share information with Eurostat on that topic, with a view to enhancing the HICP. But not on the measurement of energy prices, which is a statistical choice to how the country’s price index is compiled.  Europe is planning to use the profits from frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear to help rebuild Ukraine. The ECB is critical of this. Can you explain why?  Let me first clarify that the ECB is in favour of helping and supporting Ukraine in any way possible. But our position on utilising the dividends and interest from the frozen assets is clear. First: this should be a global decision, ideally involving all members of the G7. In addition, we have to be careful because this could lead to reputational damage. We have to look beyond this conflict in isolation, and there could be implications for the euro as a safe currency. The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation. I think there are other ways to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In Belgium, the launch of the ethical bank NewB has proved very difficult. Are barriers to setting up new banks in the eurozone too high?  Without entering into the details of any particular case, there are different procedures to be followed and criteria to be met, but there are no limitations beyond the legal and capital requirements imposed for the creation of a new retail bank.  But there haven’t been very many new banks in the last few years...  Because there are a lot of banks in the euro area! The real question to ask is about banks’ traditional business model. New sources of revenue need to be found, the number of branches has to be reduced. I suppose that investors are turning away from banks because the level of profitability doesn’t meet their expectations. I think there needs to be further cross-border consolidation.  So are there too many banks?  Given the cost structure of European banks, consolidation could help provide a solution. Above all else, I think cross-border consolidation in the euro area under a single supervisor and within the framework of a single monetary policy would be positive.\n",
      "Content 12: 9 November 2023  The ECB did not change its key interest rates at its October meeting, interrupting the series of ten consecutive interest rate increases that had brought rates up by 4.5 percentage points since July 2022. A few days later Eurostat announced that euro area headline inflation had fallen to 2.9% in October. Does this mean that interest rate hikes are over?  It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level, and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2% level we define as price stability.  The evolution of inflation has been positive overall: it was above 10% only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9%. At the same time, core inflation has also been moderating. But we have to be prudent and cautious, as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months. We will continue taking a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions.   Euro area GDP was down by 0.1% in the third quarter, and economists think inflation may rise again over the coming months as the positive base effect will progressively fade out. At the same time, there is a risk of another commodity price shock arising from the situation in the Middle East. If the ECB finds itself at a crossroads, will it prioritise growth or inflation?  Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2%. Unlike some other central banks, the ECB does not have a dual mandate.  At the same time, we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation. We expect that growth will stagnate in the second half of the year and that the fourth quarter will not differ much from the third. Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth; some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.  Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025, with some fluctuations caused by base effects. However, we believe that, if interest rates are maintained at their current levels, inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.   The ECB will publish new forecasts in December. Will these be more or less the same as in September, or are you expecting upward revisions for inflation and downward revisions for growth?   It might be premature to say it, but leading indicators point to the growth outlook being somewhat more negative than we previously projected. As regards inflation, the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.  You mentioned the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to decision-making. But in October the ECB said it considers its key interest rates to be at levels that will make a substantial contribution to lowering inflation, provided they are maintained at those levels for a sufficiently long duration. What is meant by “sufficiently long”?  This means a period of time that takes into account the potential lags of monetary policy. Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive, and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down, as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was. I would not define “sufficiently long” as used in our monetary policy statement as a concrete period of time. We will need to determine this on the basis of data. In our decision-making we will also have to take into account the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical risks related to the conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine.  But what kind of data would the ECB need to see to start reducing interest rates rather than simply keeping them at restrictive levels?  We are not there yet. We will see how things evolve month by month, but our approach now is to keep interest rates at this level long enough to reach our target. Any discussion about lowering interest rates is clearly premature.  To what extent did the ECB’s monetary policy take into account not just the euro area average but the situation in individual Member States, as there are significant differences among them, also in their level of inflation. According to Eurostat, in October Slovakia recorded the highest inflation rate of 7.8%, Slovenia registered 6.6%, while the Netherlands and Belgium recorded deflation of 1% and 1.7% respectively.  We have seen disparities among euro area countries in their economic and financial structures, in the weight of services in their economies and not least in their proximity to the conflict in Ukraine.      There are always differences in inflation and growth, but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries. Our measure of price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.  In dealing with the disparities, it is important to consider the effects of fiscal policies. With regard to base effects, we have to look at how governments have introduced, and have started to withdraw, support measures to mitigate the shocks of the energy crisis. Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries. But our monetary policy is single.  The ECB is now looking more closely, in line with other central banks, at core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. What are ECB’s main concerns in this regard? ECB President Christine Lagarde said this summer that profit margins contributed almost two-thirds to domestic inflation last year. Almost nobody mentions this anymore, but there is now a discussion about the effects of wage increases.   It is essential to focus on core inflation, for which there are several risks. First, there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation. Second, there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate, which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation. And finally, there are unit labour costs. Rising labour costs result from two factors. The first one is wage developments, with wage growth in the euro area now at just over 5%. The second is productivity, which is very low and has been declining because employment growth has been outpacing output growth.  It is true that profit margins grew even faster than unit labour costs last year. This year, however, we are seeing a moderation in profit margins, while labour costs are on the rise.  Our expectation is that part of the increase in labour costs will be absorbed via profit margins, meaning that not all of this increase will be passed through to final prices.   At the ECB, you are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to deepen your understanding of inflation. What will you do differently from what you have been doing so far and what do you hope to achieve? We know that, while not the only one, you have been wrong as far as the inflation forecast is concerned.   Our colleagues working with statistics deal with a lot of information, a lot of data on the financial system and the real economy, so any instrument that helps us manage this monumental amount of information is very useful.  So we are continually looking for algorithms that can give us a better understanding of what is happening in the economy, in the financial system, and a way of factoring in all the underlying tendencies that are embedded in the data we analyse.   There have been warnings that in its fight against inflation the ECB has been focusing only on the demand side of the economy, while supply-side factors also contribute to inflation. Is a more balanced approach warranted for the future, bearing in mind the pressures that may stem from geopolitical tensions, the demographic picture and the implications of the Green Deal? The economy has already been disrupted, is monetary policy next?  Sometimes it is important to stress that monetary policy works through interest rate increases, through the transmission of monetary policy decisions to financing conditions and then through the impact of financing conditions on aggregate demand.  So, monetary policy and the transmission of its decisions aim to influence aggregate demand, consumption and investment. Monetary policy cannot deal with supply-side issues. These need to be addressed through structural policies and fiscal policies.  Let me add that it’s not only the origin of inflation that’s important, but also the possibility of second-round effects, which can make the situation much more complicated, with a possible price-wage-profit spiral. In particular, we need to avoid de-anchoring inflation expectations, as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.  It was announced a while ago that the ECB, in cooperation with Eurostat, would include housing costs in the calculation of inflation. How far along is this project?  This was part of the ECB’s strategy review, and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation. However, such costs need to be well calibrated in the index, and this is mainly Eurostat’s responsibility. Including the cost of owner-occupied housing in the measurement – known as the owner-occupied property cost – contributes to the calibration of inflation. We are very willing to cooperate with Eurostat and provide our input and insights.   So there is no deadline?  It is not up to us. But there is a need for harmonised action at EU level, not just in the euro area, and this takes time.   The ECB has dealt with record-high euro area inflation by raising interest rates at a record pace. In the banking systems of several countries, including Slovenia, borrowers have felt the effects of this policy much more than savers. Is this also due to the consolidation of the banking market and the subsequent lack of competition?   You are right about the effects. As you know, we have made it crystal clear: whenever we raise our key interest rates, this increase should be passed on to all sides of the market.  The current situation can be explained by several factors. First, there is excess liquidity, so banks haven’t been under pressure to raise the remuneration of deposits. However, liquidity conditions are becoming less and less comfortable for European banks – there have been changes to the parameters for long-term liquidity lending to banks under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and changes to our bond-buying programmes, so the decline in liquidity will continue. Second, banks are always slower to change their pricing policy for deposits than they are for loans.  But there is a slow-but-steady increase in the remuneration of deposits, particularly time deposits. We believe that this process will continue. We are monitoring it very closely and, I’ll say it again, when we raise interest rates, we are not only raising them for borrowers, but for savers too, because otherwise the transmission of monetary policy would be incomplete.   Given that deposit interest rates lagging behind lending rates has resulted in considerable growth in banks’ net interest income, could you say that banks are pursuing short-term goals instead of long-term sustainable business goals, especially as you said yourself that the ECB is now determined to reduce excess liquidity in the system?  You’re right – the profitability of European banks has improved recently owing to the increase in key interest rates and an improvement in profit margins.  However, this has not been reflected in the market valuation of banks because markets believe that this improvement in profitability may not be sustainable over time. First, because the economy is slowing, which could lead to an increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Second, because the drop in demand for loans would reduce banks’ revenues. And third, because the cost of funding for banks is rising.  So I think that it’s quite obvious that, despite the improved profitability of banks, there are doubts about how sustainable this will be in the longer term.   What are the challenges to financial stability in the euro area now that we are in a phase of economic slowdown? What is the situation regarding insolvency proceedings, non-performing loans and risks to the banking system stemming from the real estate market? In Germany, residential property prices fell by around 10% in the second quarter. Do you expect a correction elsewhere as a consequence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening?  When interest rates go up, the financial stability situation changes. The first factor we have to look at is valuations of financial assets and real estate assets. One of the main risks we see in terms of financial stability in the euro area is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment of asset prices and the implications it could have for banks. It should be stressed that banks are in a good position in terms of profitability, capital and liquidity. But we cannot be complacent because, as I said, there are some doubts about how sustainable this improvement is going to be over time.  There is another factor for financial stability. We look very carefully at non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly real estate mutual funds. In this regard, we have seen a significant drop in commercial real estate valuations. This decline had set in before the start of the monetary policy tightening but has now accelerated following the rise in interest rates. A number of non-bank financial intermediaries have seen very steep declines, particularly in commercial real estate.  In addition to economic cooling, we are also witnessing a housing crisis across the EU. How do you respond to the criticism that the ECB’s monetary policy has contributed to this, first with bond purchases that lowered bond yields, which led institutional investors to turn to the property market for returns, and now by increasing borrowing costs, which has caused many building projects to be postponed or completely abandoned?  We can be criticised for being too lenient or for being too tough. But, if I may say, I don’t think it’s fair to be criticised for both things at the same time. There were reasons why we had a very expansionary monetary policy – think back to the pandemic and the decline in GDP. I think that without our monetary policy, the situation would have been much worse. Going back even further, to the era of quantitative easing, you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis. However, sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge, and we had to respond.  Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability. Sometimes there are lateral effects. But there are also other policies to deal with a potential real estate bubble, such as fiscal and macroprudential policies.   In other words, you are looking at developments in the real estate market through the prism of the financial stability of the banking system.  For sure. My point is that monetary policy has to be focused on price stability. However, there are other instruments available, like fiscal and other policies. In the event of real estate market growth that is not fully aligned with fundamentals, macroprudential policies can be applied, bank capital buffers can be increased and borrower-based measures can be used to limit excessive growth in real estate lending. A range of policies are available.   What are the latest trends in the credit situation in the euro area?  The evolution is quite clear: financing conditions have tightened as a result of our monetary policy decisions, resulting in a decline in credit demand, which can be seen for both households and firms. This is how monetary policy works.   My last question is on the tax issue. Banks are reporting high profits, largely due to higher net interest income. As a result, several governments have decided to levy additional taxes on them. Why is the ECB not in favour?  Our decision is based on two pillars. The first is that this kind of tax should not impair lending or the transmission of monetary policy measures to the system. The second is that such a tax should not damage the solvency of banks, as this could have medium-term consequences for banks that are not well capitalised.  We have already issued opinions for Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and now Slovenia. The taxes are not all the same, but each opinion points out that the tax should not impair lending and should not damage the solvency of banks.\n",
      "Content 13: 4 November 2023  When you were in Athens last week, you talked about Greece’s resilience and its phenomenal recovery capacity. Could you tell me how this happened? How did Greece become a success story?  When I look at the key performance indicators for assessing Greece’s economic and financial situation, I see improvements across the board: in employment, growth, the fiscal situation and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Greece has completed many of the reforms on its to-do list. Not all of them, of course. There is still more work to be done. I understand that there are more reforms in the pipeline but, overall, the results of the country’s efforts are impressive. And this did not go unnoticed by those whose job it is to rate an economy and assess its credit rating – as shown by the two recent decisions that raised Greece’s rating to investment grade. I think it’s a tremendous testament to the country’s efforts. The turnaround was thanks to the fiscal adjustments and the reforms that were implemented, but also to the resolute efforts of the Greek people and the Greek authorities.  Is the high debt-to-GDP ratio of any concern to you?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is around 160% at the moment. It has fallen significantly in the last couple of years. And obviously this downward trend needs to continue in the future. I know there is more to come, but Greece has evidently responded to this challenge with determination, and the results are already clear to see.  Did you ever get really worried about Grexit? Did you think that it was possible?  There were two particular moments where the threat could have materialised. The first was during the French G20 presidency in November 2011, when there was talk of a possible referendum, which didn’t happen in the end. The second, when the threat was much more tangible and much more worrying, was in July 2015. So, we had two Grexit threats, but the one in 2015 was the most concrete, and if it hadn’t been for the determination of a few European leaders, it would have happened.  You had a front-row seat to the Greek financial crisis from a very early stage. When you look back, do you think that any mistakes were made?  The original mistake was for the country to have found itself in that situation. If there had been greater fiscal discipline and if the prudent principle of establishing a rainy-day fund for bad times when the economy was doing well had been applied, the crisis might not have happened. The fiscal policies in place before and after the crisis hit in 2009 were the original mistakes. As I have said before, it would have been helpful for the IMF to have had longer programmes than those available in its arsenal. The programmes it had were intended for rapid and deep changes, reforms and fiscal consolidation. At the time they weren’t necessarily the best tools for a country that was in a monetary union without a fiscal union or for Greece’s specific fiscal situation.  Did you learn any lessons or draw any conclusions of your own from the crisis?  One very pertinent lesson is to make sure that we have the collective discipline to address the lack of a fiscal union. I think this should be a very pressing concern for all of us. When you have a monetary union without a fiscal union, as we do, you need clear fiscal guardrails and a fiscal framework within which countries can design and implement their fiscal policies and be accountable to the other members of the monetary union. Something else that stands out from the Greek situation is that decisions were made but then sometimes reversed by the subsequent political team. And, even when decisions were taken, the implementation and monitoring needed to move forward didn’t always happen. Another lesson is that, even when banks are not the cause of a crisis, a solid and robust financial sector with well-capitalised banks is crucial.  Are you satisfied with the current state of the Greek banking system?  I think a lot of work has been done to consolidate and strengthen the Greek banking sector. Take non-performing loans, for example. In 2016 almost 50% of loans were non-performing. Now it is just over 8%. That is a significant sign of improvement, which has involved parking those non-performing loans outside the banks. So, in a way, the banking system has been sanitised. Capital ratios are much stronger, non-performing loans have gone down and liquidity ratios are also quite solid. So yes, a lot has been done to make Greek banks more robust and more attractive.  I think the fact that a large foreign bank is taking an interest in a Greek bank is a clear indication that the sector has become more attractive.  Do you think 10 or 12 years ago it would have been possible for you and the Governor of the Bank of Greece Yannis Stournaras to take a walk around Syntagma Square where all the demonstrations were happening? What was going through your mind when you actually did it this time?  I was totally bemused by the transformation, I have to tell you. As you know, I did not come to Greece at the height of the crisis, but I was obviously in frequent contact with the team. I was following the IMF mission’s visits very closely – special security measures were taken and it was a source of anxiety and concern. Now, to walk down the street, say hello to people and feel their energy, vitality and optimism was quite striking. It is a testament to the effort and the determination of the Greeks to turn things around and to take hold of their destiny with the discipline and seriousness required in a union like the EU. I think it’s fantastic that Greece can set standards and be an example of what to do, of what reforms to implement.  Do you have the sense that economic events are driven by geopolitics these days? How hard is it to carry out fiscal and, more importantly, monetary policy?  You and I have been around for a little while. And I think that geopolitics taking precedence over many other developments is nothing new. What I think is slightly different now is that there is a compounded effect of multiple geopolitical developments taking place in various corners of the world. Sometimes they are a reflection of a major schism happening in front of us. When the world had a bipolar power structure, when it was fairly organised and settled, you could anticipate things. You could have more certainty about future developments. Now it’s far more fragmented. Crises are taking place in various parts of the globe at the same time, and it’s not clear who is on whose side and what the next development will be, let alone the final outcome of the current crisis in the Middle East. And if you add to that the crisis that we have just gone through with the pandemic, plus the terribly serious challenge of climate change, which is a tragedy that is already unfolding, that’s a lot of geopolitical and climate-related developments taking place together. That’s what’s making it even harder at the moment, which is why I think that we are confronted with shifts and breaks that, although not unimaginable, certainly fly in the face of the traditional way of thinking or the certainties that we used to have.  Do you think that inflation will recede next year?  This is certainly our forecast and this is certainly our goal. We are determined to bring inflation down to 2%. According to our projections we will get there in 2025.  It seems as though increases in food prices and housing are almost becoming structural now. Are you worried about the political implications of all this, about the political pressures stemming from the rise in the cost of living?  When we measure inflation, we pay attention to the headline rate, which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing – how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car, food on the table, or to have clothes, shelter and everything else. But we also try to understand what is underneath the most variable components. One of those components is food. Is the price of food going to be higher in the future? That’s a possibility if you look at the impact of climate change, for example. Droughts, floods, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will most likely have an impact on food prices going forward .  As for the political implications that you asked me about, let me say that our mandate is to ensure price stability, and this is the best contribution we can make to social peace and to society, to the most vulnerable of its members in particular.  The last question I’d like to ask you is what really keeps you up at night?  I try to sleep as much as I can, and at the moment it’s not a lot, I have to say. When I go to bed, I’m really tired and I fall asleep. But what preoccupies me before I go to bed is the level of violence, hatred and hubris around, which is first and foremost terrible for people – terrible for children and terrible for civilians. And of course, in addition to the human suffering, all this will have an impact on our economies, on the level of people’s confidence, and it will probably make our job a little bit harder going forward.\n",
      "Content 14: 16 October 2023  Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.  First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.  What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?  This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.  Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?  What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.  Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.  We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.  QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?  We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate. This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.  Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?   Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.  So no lowering of interest rates until spring?  We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.  And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?  Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.   As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?  I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty. And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.  Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?  I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.\n",
      "Content 15: 8 October 2023  The ECB raised its key interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in fourteen months, bringing the rate on the deposit facility to 4%, its highest level since the launch of the euro. Coming at a time when people are concerned about the level of interest rates, was this move justified?   We first need to put the action taken by the European Central Bank into context. For several years now the world has been facing a “permacrisis”, a constant succession of serious and unprecedented crises − in terms of their scale, their impact and the speed at which they emerged. The health crisis was followed by Russia’s unjustified war in Ukraine, and then by an acceleration in inflation. All this against the backdrop of the energy crisis, with a number of EU countries experiencing difficulties in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, including real estate.  The ECB’s mandate, unchanged for 25 years, is price stability. It’s our compass. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.     Do you have the tools you need to fight inflation?   Our models were not perfectly suited to the nature of these crises, which resulted, among other things, in the complete shutdown of part of the economy during the health crisis, leading to a greater role for governments, which suddenly became protective. They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades, or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation. The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections. We have worked on these issues, and we are continuing to do so, in order to make the projections more robust.   Have the past projection errors dented trust in the ECB’s actions?    Close to 80% of euro area citizens believe in and support the euro. And 45% trust the ECB, slightly more than did so before the health crisis. But we are constantly seeking effective methods and better channels of communication to explain our actions and counter fake news, which spreads far more quickly than the facts, also in the economic world. The ECB was the first central bank to acknowledge its errors with regard to the projections and to analyse the reasons for them.   And what are these reasons?  The errors were largely caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. Growth has declined across all economies – in advanced, emerging and developing countries. And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world, apart from in China. A very worrying situation, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6% in October 2022, more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3%. That means that within one year, the efforts made – along with base effects, i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago – have slowed the pace of inflation.  But that’s not the general feeling in Europe…  It’s hard to explain that the rise in prices is slowing down. Inflation persists, but it is abating and even steadily declining. That’s good news. I think our efforts have played a part in this, as have some of the economic policies pursued in Europe. At the same time, growth is weakening, which is why the International Monetary Fund has revised down its growth projections worldwide, except for the United States.  Why this gap with Europe?    Potential growth in the United States has traditionally exceeded that of Europe or of the euro area by close to 1 percentage point on average. It’s not meaningful to compare them: you can’t compare a single country with several countries. The euro area comprises 20 different countries, 20 different fiscal policies, 20 different treasuries. For a start, the United States is protected by the dollar, an international reference currency. The US economy is far more responsive and adjusts more rapidly. And it is not energy-dependent, unlike Europe, which has to import 80% of its energy.   Growth is falling in Europe. Is there a risk of recession?  We have revised down our growth projections to 0.7% in 2023, 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. The rate for 2025 is only slightly below the potential growth of the euro area. In Europe, we have devised a response and deployed unprecedented defensive measures that would have been unimaginable just three years ago, notably thanks to the Next Generation EU programme. Structural reforms are being put in place. And, just one year ago, who would have thought that we would succeed in replenishing more than 90% of our gas reserves by September 2023? This allows us to look towards the coming winter, if not calmly, then at least with a lot more confidence.   The German economy, the largest in the euro area, is slowing down sharply. What impact will this have?  This is one of the factors that is indeed weighing on the outlook for European growth. Germany had built its economic model on very cheap energy supplies and on export opportunities, especially to China. The ongoing adjustment in the German economy is affecting the growth outlook.   Does that complicate the ECB’s mission?  First and foremost, the ECB has to answer the question of how to provide price stability for economic actors across the entire euro area. To this end, we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area, as well as underlying inflation – excluding energy and food.  In France, people are acutely aware of inflation. Why is that?  High and persistent inflation affects people’s purchasing power. But overall, while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average, for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.  Is this also due to the rise in interest rates?  Not exclusively. The ECB rates are the same for France as for all euro area countries. We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.  Doesn’t this threaten growth?  Our mandate is price stability, and interest rates are our tool. We raise rates to make the financing of economic activity more expensive in a manner that dampens demand, and to thus bring about an adjustment between supply and demand, notably through reduced investment and consumption. The goal is obviously not to create a recession, but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and, above all, prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral. We must avoid this at all costs. We want to get inflation back to 2%, and we will achieve that.  Is there a risk of a wage-price spiral?  We aren’t seeing that for the moment, but we are monitoring it closely. Wage growth is expected to be around 5.3% in the euro area in 2023, and that figure is projected to be 4.3% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2% over the coming years.  Is the housing crisis that is picking up pace in France and Germany collateral damage from monetary policy?  The ECB sets the key interest rates in view of its price stability mandate. The housing sector is indeed sensitive to interest rates. But for many of the problems, all authorities need to get around the table and think about the stock of housing supply, and about social housing in particular. The fact remains that the major risk would be if people get into debt without having adequate means and are then confronted with repayment deadlines they cannot meet.  Is the ECB pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook?  There are three reasons why we are not pessimistic. We expect growth figures to increase next year. Inflation is currently falling significantly. And the employment rate is higher than it’s ever been in Europe, and it’s stabilising at that level. The big question right now concerns businesses. Will they accept absorbing part of the salary increases that will be negotiated this year and next in their margins – which didn’t change much in 2022? This is a key question. In our economic projections, we assume that businesses will behave as they have done during previous crises, in that they will reduce their margins a little in order to absorb part of the salary increases. The fall in demand should point them in that direction. It’s in their interest to do so, as public opinion will put them under pressure, as will the public authorities. The second element that is very important is energy prices. I think we have to get used to the idea that oil prices will remain high. This should spur us to pursue the fight against climate change even more vigorously, and to shift towards an energy mix that is less dependent on fossil fuels and foreign suppliers.  Anxiety is growing in European society in the face of a number of measures taken to fight climate change. How should we react?  We cannot wait. Combating climate change is imperative – we should all be hammering that message home. Everyone needs to realise it’s an emergency. We will only achieve this energy transition if we have everyone’s support, and with distributive policies that don’t worsen inequality. We cannot allow the energy transition to fail. Nor can we allow the consequences of climate change to become long-lasting. That is not an option. We have to find the fiscal and social means to make it as painless as possible for everyone, and for the most vulnerable in particular. A collective approach is needed. If there is any area where Europeans should borrow collectively, invest and share the burden as equally as possible, it’s the fight against climate change.  What will follow the current version of the Stability and Growth Pact?  I hope the European Heads of State or Government and the finance ministers will reach an agreement before the end of the year. The sooner there is an agreement on a reformed fiscal framework, the earlier we have clarity on the path of fiscal policies going forward.\n",
      "Content 16: 6 October 2023    From the ECB's perspective, have the new [September inflation] data brought about any changes in terms of the drivers of inflation growth?    Overall, the recent news on inflation is encouraging. Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably, and it now stands at 4.3% after peaking at 10.6% in October of last year. A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks, as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly. It is also a consequence of statistical effects, the so-called base effects, given that we had unusually large price increases a year ago. When it comes to core inflation, which excludes energy and food, it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5% in the euro area, hence above headline inflation. However, its September print was lower than expected.  It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly, but it is still well above our target of 2%, which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, that “last kilometre” may well prove to be the hardest.  How worrying is the oil price increase that we have witnessed in recent months?  The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on, because we could have new supply side shocks stemming, for instance, from energy or food prices. This year, we’ve experienced frequent extreme weather events, which may have an impact on harvests and lead to higher food prices next year. In addition, the base effects from energy may eventually reverse, putting upside pressure on inflation. Therefore,  we must not be complacent, and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.  What does it mean for the broad expectations among economists, the financial markets and even among central banks, that there will be no need for further interest rate hikes? That’s at least how the latest ECB messages have been interpreted.  One has to look carefully at what we communicated. We said that our decisions will continue to be data dependent. Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2%. However,  we cannot say that we are at the peak or for how long rates will need to be kept at restrictive levels. This will depend on the data, so we will continue to look at three factors: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all of them are moving in the right direction. But I still see upside risks to inflation. There could be new supply side shocks. Moreover, wages could grow more strongly than expected, potentially accompanied by lower-than-expected productivity growth, while firms might not absorb those higher costs through their profit margins. Such risks need to be monitored carefully. If they materialised, further interest rate hikes could be necessary at some point.  Even though inflation has slowed considerably, there are still major differences in inflation rates among countries, ranging from negative numbers in the Netherlands to almost 9% in Slovakia. To what extent do these differences affect the setting of monetary policy? Are they really taken into account?  Our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. Naturally, our monetary policy decisions also take into account information from individual Member States, but we cannot respond to specific developments in a particular country. Such developments are best tackled by national policies, such as fiscal or structural policies. The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation. There are several reasons for the large role played by energy: First, countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation. Second, governments responded differently to the energy price shock, with some governments imposing price controls, which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on. Of course, these measures also had different fiscal implications, because some of them expire automatically when energy prices fall, while others need to be actively reversed, which typically takes longer. And finally, the institutional characteristics of energy markets differ across Member States. In some of them, wholesale energy prices translate quickly into retail prices, both when energy prices rise and fall. In other countries the response is more sluggish due to the fact that there are fixed-price contracts in place with a long duration. One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices, which constitute a large share of the consumption basket. This heterogeneity complicates our monetary policy, but we nevertheless need to focus on the euro area as a whole.  The government in Croatia, as well as in some other countries, is trying to introduce price controls on energy and certain basic consumer items. What is your view of these measures, what are the good and the bad sides of such an approach to lowering inflationary pressures?  Measures that directly control prices, such as price caps, have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which may be reversed once the measures are lifted. This helps to smooth inflation over time, but it also distorts the steering effect of prices. This may be counterproductive, because it does not incentivise lower consumption, for example, of energy. In addition, such measures can weigh heavily on the fiscal budget, especially if they are broad-based rather than targeting the more vulnerable groups. In general, measures that increase the supply capacity are preferable to those that directly control prices.  But do they work in the short run?  In the short run, they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation, which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers, as these often depend on current developments in inflation. But overall, the negative effects often outweigh the positive.   One of the problems in Croatia, which has one of the highest inflation rates in the euro area, seems to lie in ample excess liquidity in the banking sector. This has increased strongly since Croatia joined the euro area on account of banks’ lower minimum reserve requirements. The argument is that this impedes the transmission of higher ECB interest rates and prevents a stronger impact on inflation. What do your analyses on the success of monetary policy transmission in Member States indicate?  What matters for monetary policy in a currency union is excess liquidity at the euro area level and not at the country level. Excess liquidity in the euro area is very high, but this does not impede monetary policy transmission. We have seen that the increases in our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, have been fully transmitted to the money market and have translated into a measurable increase in funding costs in the economy. But you are right, monetary policy transmission can play out differently across Member States. One crucial factor is the prevalence of variable versus fixed-rate loans. The average lending rates adjust more quickly if there is a higher share of loans with a variable interest rate. Croatia is a special case, given that it joined the euro just recently. The drop in minimum reserve requirements from a level of 9% to 1% led to an increase in excess liquidity in the system. However, the strong loan growth that we are seeing in Croatia is not related to this but to the relatively strong economic performance, which is partly driven by the boom in tourism. That is why the Croatian National Bank decided to further increase the countercyclical capital buffer for banks to counter excessive loan growth. This is another way of dealing with the heterogeneity in a currency union, using macroprudential tools at the national level.  Would that be in the national central bank’s domain?  Yes, these macroprudential tools are mainly decided at national rather than European level – in Croatia’s case by the central bank – so they can be adjusted to the specific situation in a given country.   Do you see tourism as the main contributor to economic growth and credit activity in Croatia?  It is definitely one of the factors driving growth in Croatia’s economy. It has always been a very attractive place for summer holidays, and its attractiveness has probably increased since it joined the euro area. Two of my daughters, for example, travelled to Croatia recently, not only because it is beautiful, but also because it now has the euro.  The general public is concerned by the fact that banks are faring the best under the current circumstances, because they are generating high income from central banks without any effort or risk.   This is related to the high volume of excess liquidity created by our previous monetary policy actions: the lending operations and bond purchases, which we call quantitative easing. Excess liquidity is remunerated at our deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. In line with our interest rate tightening, we have now started to shrink our balance sheet, and this is happening very quickly, even though the balance sheet is still very large.  We need to pay interest on reserves, at least at the margin, to make sure that short-term money market rates are closely anchored to our policy rate and therefore in line with our intended monetary policy stance. Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control. Now, what seems to create most of the unease is that banks raised their lending rates much more quickly than they passed these increases on to their depositors. But this transmission is getting stronger. Rates on time deposits have risen quite a bit, and we also see that people are beginning to shift their funds out of sight deposits into alternative investments that pay higher interest rates.  This market mechanism eventually forces banks to adjust their deposit rates. But this also means that banks’ funding costs will go up over time. Even though the impact on profitability is very positive in the short run, longer-term consequences of higher interest rates on bank profitability may well prove to be less benign, because the interest income on bank assets may rise more slowly than their funding costs.  The ECB recently abolished the remuneration paid to banks on minimum reserves, but there are proposals for an increase in the minimum reserve requirement ratio at euro area level to reduce liquidity in the system. What is your view on this?     In July, we had a comprehensive discussion on the minimum reserve requirements and their remuneration. We came to the conclusion that, from a monetary policy perspective, it would be appropriate to keep them at a level of 1% but to remunerate them at 0% instead of applying the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. Let me stress three points.  First, our main tool for adjusting our monetary stance is our policy rates and not minimum reserve requirements. Second, minimum reserve requirements are linked to the volume of deposits, which means that they mainly affect banks with high holdings of deposits rather than those with high holdings of excess liquidity. Therefore, they tend to put a larger burden on smaller banks. Also, these higher reserve requirements may lead to “avoidance strategies” by banks, which could remunerate deposits by even less or shift them to entities outside the euro area, where there are no minimum reserve requirements. Lastly, we are currently discussing the design of our future operational framework for monetary policy implementation. As long as we do not know the role that minimum reserve requirements will play in this new framework, we should be cautious about making any far-reaching decisions.  In any case, the reduction of excess liquidity through the shrinking of our balance sheet will continue for some time and, eventually, all our asset purchase programmes will go into full run-off.   Economic growth prospects have worsened quite substantially, with the possibility of recession not being excluded from forecasts. What is your understanding of the drivers and the consequences of this recent deterioration in the business climate?  Over recent months, we have seen that most economic indicators point to a slowing growth momentum. We first saw a pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector, which started to spread to the services sector as the reopening effects from the pandemic faded. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for manufacturing are in deeply contractionary territory, and those for services are also signalling contraction. Consumer confidence has increased notably over the past year but remains at low levels. All this is pointing to subdued economic developments over the rest of this year.  While a technical recession cannot be excluded, there are no indications of a deep or prolonged downturn. One reason is the labour market, which is still quite resilient, resulting in strong nominal wage growth. As inflation falls, real incomes are rising, which supports economic growth going forward. What is clear is that our monetary policy will continue to have a dampening effect on economic growth.  So, there is no reason for concern of a deeper recession setting in?    We see indications of a period of stagnation but not of a deep or prolonged recession.  Still, the state of the economy in Germany, as a country that is a very important export market for many EU Member States, is not encouraging. How justified are the claims that Germany is currently the “sick man of Europe”?   Germany is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. Its economy has been hit twice: by the energy price shock and by weaker growth in China. This has exposed structural weaknesses linked to the dependence on cheap energy and on a booming economy in China that was eager to buy German manufacturing products. On top of this, Germany faces challenges regarding demographic developments, as it has a rapidly ageing society implying an increasing scarcity of labour, as well as the green transition which, as in many other countries, is facing political obstacles. Cyclical factors, i.e. weak domestic and foreign demand, will eventually fade, but the structural factors may weigh on potential growth and hence have longer-term effects. All this implies that  Germany, as is the case with many other countries, will need to adjust its business model to the changing global conditions, as well as to its domestic challenges.  How likely do you think that is?  Germany has managed to transform itself in the past and I am confident that it will be able to do so today. Naturally, this requires strategic thinking and openness to change. In particular, the green transition offers Germany vast opportunities to regain its technological leadership. The economy will pick up eventually, but the main issue concerns long-term potential growth, and that depends very much on how Germany tackles its structural challenges.  Arguments that the global economy is generally entering a phase of weak growth and disinflation are gaining ground. What do you see as having the most impact on inflation looking ahead?  What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics. When input costs rose sharply, many firms raised their prices in excess of the cost increase. So we saw an increase in profits in many sectors, also due to temporary supply-demand imbalances caused by bottlenecks and reopening effects. As a result of rising prices, employees experienced a drop in real wages. Now employees are trying to regain lost purchasing power, and tight labour market conditions are making it easier for the unions to negotiate higher wage increases. It is through such second-round effects that inflation becomes more persistent. The weakening of the economy, which is partly due to monetary policy transmission, makes it harder for firms to pass through higher wage costs to prices, meaning they may need to absorb higher costs through their profit margins. We see indications that this is happening. How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation, particularly underlying inflation, will be going forward.   There is a major difference of opinion as to how corporate profit margins over the last period have spurred inflation growth, with some analyses pointing to the conclusion that they were totally irrelevant.  Inflation is not only the result of rising wages or higher energy prices. Profits have also increased quite a lot over recent years. Looking ahead, the question is by how much wages will increase and to what extent rising wage costs will be absorbed by profit margins. It is only natural to expect that the unions and employees will try to regain some of the lost purchasing power and that wages will grow. But it is crucial how firms respond, and that depends on demand conditions and hence on our monetary policy.  Fiscal policy is expected to be prudent and cautious in order to curb inflation. However, politicians have their own concerns, such as a decline in the living standards of their citizens and in investment. On account of its widening fiscal deficit, Italy is again in the spotlight, and so is an increase in its bond yields. How does one reconcile these opposing goals?  We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years, which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures. However, we have also learnt over the years that consolidation should not come at the expense of necessary public investments. What really matters is the composition of public spending, which should aim to make the economy more productive and to strengthen the supply capacity. This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term. Therefore, it would be unwise to postpone public investments and structural reforms that are necessary to transform the economy. This is where the European funds come into play. The Next Generation EU programme can help countries to continue investing in their future. At the same time, the perception that the government can counter every economic shock through fiscal transfers is dangerous and could lead to unsustainable fiscal dynamics.    When it comes to recent yield movements in global financial markets, the largest part is driven by a general repricing of longer-term rates, as markets are anticipating interest rates to be held at a high level over a longer period of time. These higher funding costs imply that governments need to be even more prudent.  The ECB’s position that the price of borrowing will remain high for as long as necessary to reach the target inflation rate has been communicated quite clearly. Nevertheless, is there anything else that can be said in that context?     Our policy is data dependent, which implies that the level and duration of restrictive rates will depend on how the data develop. What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner. That is then also embedded in inflation expectations. One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly “anchored” around our target, in spite of painfully high inflation rates. Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.\n",
      "Content 17: 2 October 2023  It’s been two weeks since the ECB raised rates for the tenth consecutive time, have you now done enough to tame inflation?  Let me stress an issue, which is sometimes slightly overlooked but is a very important part of the discussion, namely the transmission of monetary policy. That's crucial in order to understand the decisions that we have taken and those that we will take. In transmission you have two different legs. The first one is from our monetary policy decisions to financial markets and banks. In that first stage, the transmission is almost complete. You can see it. In the banking channel, there has been a tightening of financing conditions following our decisions. And there has been a significant drop in the demand for credit.  The second phase is how the impact of the tightening of financing conditions feeds through to the real economy. And here there is much more uncertainty. We have seen a slowdown in economic activity. But there are other factors behind that, for instance the impact of inflation on households’ disposable income and the evolution of exports, which is related to the slowdown in the global economy. The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy, and indirectly to inflation. That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates, if maintained over time, will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.   Do you worry about the risks of overdoing the tightening of monetary policy and driving the economy into an unnecessarily painful recession?   We do not at all want to create an unnecessarily painful recession. We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy. This is, at the end of the day, a very delicate balance. If the transmission is incomplete, then we should be a little more patient. If the transmission is much closer to completion, then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.   Does the recent rise in oil and gas prices, coupled with a weaker euro, make your task more difficult?   Yes, it makes our task more difficult. I would not say that it is a game changer. But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.   What would it take for the ECB to start cutting rates?   Well, we are not there.   But what would you need to see?   First of all, progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability, i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way. Starting to talk about rate cuts now is premature. We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Still, I think the last stretch is going to be more difficult. We are on our way towards 2 per cent. That’s clear. But we must monitor that very closely, as the last mile will not be easy.   But would the last mile be the hardest to achieve in bringing inflation down?  First let’s look at the factors in favour of disinflation. Base effects have an impact. Supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away. And there is monetary policy and the clear slowdown in the economy. In the second half of the year the economy in the euro area will have stagnated.  Now let’s turn to factors against disinflation. There’s a spike in oil prices. Wages are growing about 5 per cent on average. Demand for services is high, even though we have started to see a clear slowdown. And the euro has depreciated.  So, when you put all this in the balance, our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months. But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.   Are governments making inflation worse by continuing to run big deficits?   The first factor with respect to fiscal policy is the withdrawal of the subsidies granted over the last two years, which must be completed before the end of 2023. But it’s not only that. There is also the fiscal stance, which sometimes gets overlooked. My impression is that after four years without EU fiscal rules, governments may have got used to a little bit of a “whatever it takes” approach with respect to fiscal policy. But that has to change. Having a tightening of monetary policy and, simultaneously, an expansionary fiscal policy would be a very bad policy mix. And being more concrete, what would be detrimental is a fiscal deficit that goes above the level of 2022.   Does the ECB need to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system?   We are doing that. And this is totally normal in the process of normalisation of monetary policy. That is the correct pace, the correct path. TLTRO reached €2.1 trillion and now we are a little bit below €500 billion. And over the next year it will become close to zero.  What about stopping reinvestments in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme?  Some of my colleagues in the Governing Council have been quite outspoken with respect to the need for starting the process of quantitative tightening on the PEPP. But in the formal structure of the Council, we have not even started the discussion. It will arrive sooner or later.  Do you still need the flexibility of PEPP reinvestments as the first line of defence against financial market fragmentation, despite not having used it for two years?  If you ask the military, they will tell you that extra lines of defence are always good. Yes, we could use flexibility in the reimbursement of the PEPP to address fragmentation. It has not been used for two years because spreads are quiet. The PEPP is less than €2 trillion. Therefore, even doing a full run-off, the withdrawal of liquidity will not be huge. It is the first line of defence in times of volatility in markets, but that is not the case now. So, we’ll have to analyse it.  How about the banking system? Do you expect an increase in non-performing loans?  Return on European banks’ equity has clearly improved because of the widening of net interest margins after the increase in interest rates and it is now above 10%. Two years ago, it was around 4%. But banks’ valuations have not moved in parallel. Why? I think that the main reason is because the cost of equity of the European banks has increased quite a lot and it’s close to 15%. When interest rates increase, the cost of equity also goes up. Markets are also pricing in that the improvement in profitability will not be sustainable over time because they are factoring in an economic slowdown. And they price in that banks will have to increase provisions should non-performing loans levels go up.  This means profitability will be dented in the future. The current figures are a sort of illusion. In the pipeline, we start to see that the quality of the assets is deteriorating, and there’s an increase in non-performing loans. On top of that, taxes on bank profits have created some uncertainty.   Should countries not introduce bank taxes?   Not all bank taxes are identical. You have seen that in the case of Italy. The final proposal is much more sensible than the first one. Our point is very clear: these taxes should not impair credit and should not create any limitation in the capitalisation of European banks. This applies as well in terms of the banks being prudent in dividend payments and share buybacks, and even the remuneration of bankers.  Some members of the Governing Council would like to increase the minimum reserve requirements for the banks, on which you pay no interest. What do you think of that?  My opinion is that we should conduct monetary policy based on price stability, not on the profit and loss of national central banks. To reach price stability, you have to reduce liquidity. The reduction of liquidity will give rise to a reduction of these windfall profits that the commercial banks are getting at the moment because of increasing interest rates.   Are there any signs of distress in the property sector?   In commercial property there has been a very important decline in prices, mainly in some Nordic countries. The main problems have appeared in Sweden, Finland, the Nordic countries. But it’s quite pervasive. Residential real estate is more resilient. But, for instance, in the case of Germany, it was not a total surprise to see the recent data showing that house prices have declined by almost 10%. That’s a clear indication that there were some pockets of overvaluation that are going to be corrected. Our concern now are the non-banks, the property and mutual funds, that have a big exposure to real estate. I would say that commercial property – even though we also need to pay attention to residential property – is our main source of concern in terms of financial stability.\n",
      "Content 18: 27 September 2023  Your speech at   Terschelling   was something of a departure for a central banker, in that it was clearly very personal, while at the same time seeking to counter a certain pessimism regarding attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Are you concerned that there isn’t sufficient buy-in at the moment from, as you put it, “those who pollute, those who finance the polluters, and those who supervise the financiers of the polluters”?  Looking back at the past five years, there are many things that clearly show we are not transitioning to a zero-emission economy fast enough, with all the problems that brings economically. On the other hand, many other things are going in the right direction. My main message was that we can do this, but we need to be fast. The later the transition, the higher the cost, as our recent economy-wide climate stress test has shown. So I might have used a little more pathos than I would have done if speaking here in Frankfurt, but the message is just as clear.  Is the ECB doing enough?   As supervisors we have a multi-year strategy. We published our expectations for climate-related and environmental risks in 2020. In 2021 we asked the banks to conduct self-assessments of where they stood vis-à-vis these expectations. On the basis of what we saw a year ago, the glass is slowly filling up, but it is not yet half full and it needs to be full by the end of 2024. I do see progress – banks are now better equipped to manage climate-related and environmental risks than when we made our initial assessments. Each of our expectations has been met at least once by a bank we supervise. The glass is filling up – but it is not yet full. Building on what the banks themselves found reasonable, we set a series of interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year, the second at the end of 2023 and the last – by which banks need to satisfy all our expectations – at the end of 2024. And we have said that we will use all our instruments to enforce these deadlines if needed.  Banks understand that we mean what we say and that this is within our mandate, because climate-related and environmental risks translate into financial risks which must be managed by the banks. This is also acknowledged worldwide. Although you do still see differences in how fast and how ambitious supervisors are, the fact of these risks being within their mandate is no longer controversial. That is a real step forward, and one which also reflects the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example.  But in that speech and others you’ve highlighted the urgency that’s required. Is that compatible with what is arguably still a very gradualist approach aimed, essentially, at trying to bring banks along with you, rather than you saying “you absolutely have to do this now, and if you don’t there will be consequences”?  First of all, ask the bankers. I don’t think that they would say that this is extremely gradual – many banks probably feel that we are pursuing this rather enthusiastically. There are clear deadlines − also interim deadlines − and we will enforce them if necessary. To be very clear, that includes periodic penalty payments. That’s not a step we take lightly, so I think that this shows how serious we are when we issue supervisory expectations. Do I particularly like that? Well, I believe it’s better to convince the banks. I know we’re asking a lot, and some banks would say it’s very difficult and claim that they can’t really do anything because they lack the data. But it is also true that the risks don’t become smaller just because they are difficult to measure. There is still a lot you can do short of perfection. But the risks are out there, and they will not wait until 2030 or 2050 to materialise – so we need to make real progress. Patchy data are better than no data at all. The same is true of the emerging art of climate modelling. Patchy climate models are better than nothing, but if you don’t even identify the gaps, you cannot really make progress towards filling them. There are many other things banks can do besides climate modelling, and we have also published a guide of best practices for banks that sets out these numerous options.  So looking at it from other directions, is there anything more that the ECB could, or should, be doing beyond compliance, such as making green investment more attractive? Might we one day see the green TLTROs (targeted longer-term refinancing operations) that commentators were discussing not so long ago?  Whereas up to now we’ve been speaking about what we are doing in our banking supervision, you are now asking a question about what we might consider in our monetary policy. Talking about possible future instruments is of course highly speculative, because whenever we design an instrument, we take into consideration all the circumstances of that particular moment. Any instrument needs to be effective to pursue our primary mandate of price stability, and it needs to be proportionate. It also depends on the environment – whether we are in a period of policy tightening or accommodation. But climate considerations are clearly part of the monetary policy strategy we adopted in 2021. I think it’s fair to assume that we will take climate considerations into account in the features of any type of instrument we may design in future − including any purchase programme.  In your speech you also mentioned the extent to which national governments subsidise fossil fuel industries. Obviously, there are limits to the ECB’s mandate, and maybe this is pushing those limits. But insofar as this issue constitutes a financial stability risk, can the ECB play a greater role? Or should it be left to private citizens to pursue the issue through the courts?  You’re talking to a lawyer, and the overriding requirement through all of this is that we act within our mandate. And when I talk to banks, I point out that we are seeing exponential growth in climate-related litigation. From our perspective, banks need to manage that risk at a time when there are certain cases in which the courts have endorsed rather far-reaching legal theories, including against states. It can no longer be taken for granted that those judgments will not be repeated or set a precedent, and that is something banks should be acutely aware of.  You said recently that there will be a just transition or no transition. Could you unpack that a little?  What I wanted to say there is that, if you look at what is happening in the world, it is clear that there is a risk of a growing antagonism – that the energy transition and climate crisis become politicised. All EU Member States have committed to becoming Paris Agreement-aligned. Not delivering on that, or postponing the transition, will lead to an economically suboptimal situation where the transition ends up being more costly. Our own analysis has also shown this time and again. Bringing attention to this issue is within our mandate.  If we could turn to monetary policy – In your last Governing Council meeting, the ECB raised interest rates again. For the final time in the cycle?  We have said it very clearly: we consider that, with the decisions we’ve made and on the basis of our current assessment, the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term. Does that mean policy rates have peaked? Not necessarily. There is still a lot of uncertainty. That’s why we take these decisions meeting by meeting, on a data-dependent basis. Making any predictions about what we will do next would not be consistent with that approach.  How do you see the balance of risks to the inflation outlook? Is it simply that the latest hike puts the ECB on a sounder footing by guarding against any additional upward price pressures?  I think that’s exactly what it is. Of course, there are upward risks to inflation. There could, for example, be upward pressures on food and energy prices – since July we have been alluding in our monetary policy statement to the importance of weather and climate conditions in this respect. Climate change could also lead to a shift in longer-term inflation dynamics, but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation. Helpful distinctions have also been proposed by my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Isabel Schnabel, analysing the impact of climate change itself, the ongoing dependency on fossil fuels and the green transition. Some aspects are certainly inflationary – 2022’s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67% compared with the year before, for example, so that’s rather significant. But it could also be the case that, over much longer horizons and depending on how the transition goes, energy will become much more abundant and cheaper.  Do you see any evidence that the current interest rate environment is having a negative effect on green investment?  Any interest rate decision has an effect on investment, both green and non-green. In the end, I think the best we can do is make sure that we deliver on our price stability mandate. That will create the stable environment in which the transition – including the required investment, which needs to be sped up – can take place.  How concerned are you about the growth outlook for the euro area? Or does the primary mandate of price stability ultimately matter more?  What we’re seeing is a more protracted period of sluggish growth than we were expecting. Of course, we need to look at the various explanatory factors, such as lower demand for euro area exports, the impact of tighter financing conditions, lower residential and business investment, and the weakening services sector. On the other hand, labour markets are still strong and disposable income is expected to rise, which would have a stabilising effect on overall GDP growth. It’s also true that our primary mandate is to deliver price stability, and I think we have proven we are very determined to do that, as seen in the ten rate hikes that we’ve decided on since July 2022.  So would you consider cutting rates if growth were to surprise significantly to the downside in the coming months?  I think I’ve explained very clearly how we take our decisions. We take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and we look at all the incoming data. We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments, and we will weigh any incoming data carefully, as always, in relation to our inflation outlook.  Would you need to see inflation clearly and consistently trending below 2% over the course of your medium-term projections before considering a cut appropriate? Equally, would reinvestments need to have stopped by that time?  Let me stick to what I have just said. As you know, we stand ready to adjust all our instruments as needed. Based on today’s assessments, we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target. We will keep rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.\n",
      "Content 19: 22 September 2023  You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?  Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.  So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?  So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.  So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?  Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.  As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?  I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.  You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?  Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.  Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?  This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.\n",
      "Content 20: 5 September 2023  Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?  We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.  In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?  Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.  Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.  Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.  I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?  I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing. This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.  I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.  I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?  Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.  Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.  I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?  Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.  Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.  Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?  I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.  I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?  The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.  Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?  Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.  Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?  We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.  We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic!  For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?\n"

      "Content 1: Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.\n",
      "Content 2: In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.\n",
      "Content 3: Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!\n",
      "Content 4: .de Frankfurt am Main, 22 January 2024 A Franco-German homage and appeal  As a young member of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble founded the Baden-Alsace discussion group together with the Mayor of Colmar, Joseph Rey. In his last ever campaign appearances, he supported pro-European parliamentary candidates in Alsace and Lorraine. Born during the war, raised in the French occupation zone, elected in the border region of southern Baden, friendship with France was close to his heart throughout his life – as the foundation for a strong Europe.  As a minister, Wolfgang Schäuble worked in close contact with his French counterparts. He was the first German finance minister to participate in a meeting of the French cabinet at the Élysée Palace. He formulated the aspiration to always take French and European interests into account: “If a solution is good for Europe, then it is good for Germany. And if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany”. German unity and European integration, open borders and joint security, a strong euro as a guarantee of stability – these fundamental convictions shaped his actions.  As President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, together with the then President of the French National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, spearheaded the establishment of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on 25 March 2019 in Paris; this joint chamber, comprising 50 German and 50 French members of parliament, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both Presidents had previously signed the Franco-German Parliamentary Accord, which – some 56 years after the Élysée Treaty – adds a parliamentary dimension to the Franco-German friendship as an intergovernmental agreement, thus raising it to a completely new level. None of this would have been possible without Wolfgang Schäuble’s impassioned efforts alongside his colleague in Paris.  Even in his last interview – published on 24 December 2023, just two days before he passed away – Wolfgang Schäuble called for reviving the Weimar Triangle as a “German-Polish-French engine for Europe” and strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities: “Let’s follow this European path. Only by working together can Europe play an economic, military and environmental role in the world.“  That is his legacy. And that is why the state memorial ceremony in his honour is quite rightly taking place on 22 January, “Franco-German Day” – exactly 61 years after the signing of the Élysée Treaty and six years to the day since Wolfgang Schäuble became the first President of the Bundestag to address the French National Assembly on 22 January 2018. In that speech he described the Franco-German friendship as \"a gift from history\", but one owed to the vision of courageous people who, after the world wars and the crimes committed by Germany, showed the way to reconciliation. Wolfgang Schäuble said: “What has been achieved inspires us to move forward” and added “Let us use the freedom we enjoy today. Let us live up to our responsibilities as courageously as the original signatories. Together! ”  Wolfgang Schäuble more than lived up to these responsibilities, and did so honestly and tirelessly. Yet the state memorial ceremony in the German Bundestag with Emmanuel Macron is more than just a tribute to great merit. It is a mission and an appeal. It is a mission entrusted to us, as leaders in politics and society, to bring the European vision to life in a spirit of close partnership. And it is an appeal to young people to keep enthusiastically pursuing the idea of Europe. Peace, freedom and friendship cannot be taken for granted, we have to work for them again and again. As for European integration, it is far from complete and must continue to be shaped, with determination – and by those who are truly European at heart, as was Wolfgang Schäuble.  We will honour Wolfgang Schäuble's memory with immense gratitude for his life's work. We pay tribute to a great German, a great friend of France and a great European. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Wolfgang Schäuble.\n",
      "Content 5: The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?  The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.  Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.  The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.   What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?  The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.  Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.   Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?  Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.   The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?  I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.  It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.  Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?  For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.  Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?  The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.   Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?  For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.  Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?   We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.   There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?  Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.  Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?  That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.  EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?   A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.  Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?  We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.  Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?  It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.\n",
      "Content 6: Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% inflation is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: \"central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s\". Yet, we have seen how inflation has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the \"normal mechanism\" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of \"austrian\" or \"hard-money\" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As inflation falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about inflation reacceleration or does the link between Growth/Inflation (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Inflation has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on inflation in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee inflation reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to inflation as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling inflation raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying inflation are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that inflation is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and inflation. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly disinflationary before the pandemic and inflationary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of inflationary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our inflation target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average inflation after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act inflation after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average inflation?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, inflation will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term inflation and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or inflation.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and inflation is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core inflation above 2% for the entire year. At which level inflation would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that inflation sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the disinflationary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate inflation BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see inflation returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect inflation to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Does the ECB take into account the asymmetries that are produced from its policies due to the fact that the EZ is not a proper monetary union? Do you think it should/shouldn't? Thank you   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further steps in European integration would clearly benefit our single monetary policy. Therefore we need to make further progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union. #AskECB    @ecb   Why would any Country give up their sovereign currency knowing that money can be printed instead of borrowed ? The US,UK,Can... have retained their sovereignty, they are in a better situation to react to \"shocks\" in the economy. natural or man made.   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro area countries have decided to give up their own currencies and join the euro. A currency union reduces transaction costs and facilitates trade by removing exchange rate risks. The euro enjoys wide support in all member countries. #AskECB   Also, how far can BVB go in the Champions League this season?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: All the way! #AskECB  Time to wrap up for today. Many thanks for your questions – I really enjoyed our chat! Take care, @Isabel_Schnabel #AskECB\n",
      "Content 7: When I think of Wolfgang Schäuble, the first image I see is him sitting across from me at the table of the French cabinet in the Élysée Palace, the first German finance minister to participate in such a meeting. I see him sitting at the negotiating table in Brussels, at one of our many meetings that ran long into the night. I hear the straight talker who never shied away from difficult decisions. I remember the dedicated public servant, a master of diplomacy with the intellectual ability to understand opposing viewpoints. I see a natural statesman with the courage to stand by his convictions as well as the pragmatism to recognise the world as it is. And I see a man of loyalty and kindness.  The recent passing of my dear friend and colleague saddens me deeply, and my heart goes out to his family. Yet I take comfort in remembering his remarkable achievements for Europe. I recall his own words in this regard because they capture his clear commitment to both Germany and Europe: “If a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.” Few have done as much for Germany and Europe over such a long period as Wolfgang, with his more than half a century of public service. As minister of the interior, he was at the heart of Germany’s reunification process. It was a moment of profound change for the country and for all Europeans, and one that had to be handled with great care in view of the sensitivities of neighbouring countries to German history. Wolfgang understood that one of the best ways for Germany to demonstrate its responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours. That was no small matter in a nation so proud of the Deutsche Mark. But he knew that a single currency would bind Europe together and protect the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations, and that this was in Germany’s and in Europe’s best interests. When Europe’s sovereign debt crisis came, Wolfgang was a calming influence, reminding us that the euro is much more than just a currency. His defence of Europe was unwavering and absolute. Nevertheless, he was always self-reflective, and later asked himself how things could have been done differently, potentially causing less suffering. Wolfgang’s intellectual rigour stemmed from his ability to combine the subtlety of a diplomat with the attention to detail of a lawyer. It was a quality that put him at the forefront of discussions in the 1990s on how to build a more deeply integrated European framework.  His statesmanship would have been welcome in today’s challenging environment of extreme views. His success did not come through a forceful personality, but from understanding how to find common ground with others. This approach has served Germany and Europe well. In my experience, Wolfgang’s philosophy was consistent: stay true to yourself and to your democratic institutions. Now is a timely moment to remember that as we remember him. I will miss my dear friend, and the birthday flowers he sent me over many years!\n",
      "Content 8: Inflation has recently fallen to 2.4%, more rapidly than expected. Are you satisfied?    We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2%. We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term, as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire, such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services. We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2% by 2025.  So, we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.   But you do want to go the last mile?  We must go the last mile: we have an inflation target of 2%.   Would 2.1% not be enough?  We want to return to 2% on a sustainable basis.   There is war in Ukraine and Gaza. How much do global crises influence the central bank’s work?   Geopolitical shocks lead to uncertainty and thereby affect economic decisions. At the same time, they can also push up energy prices and hit world trade by disrupting supply chains – which we see happening in the Red Sea right now. Geopolitics can also influence the green transition, if the supply of commodities, such as those required for producing solar cells or batteries, is restricted for political ends. All of this affects our core business: the fight against inflation.   Your policy rate decisions are data-dependent, as you always emphasise. How useful are historical data to you when, as at present, the global situation is constantly changing fundamentally?  Historical data are valuable as one can derive patterns from them. But the world can change very quickly. We then need to adjust our analyses, without discarding historical knowledge. The macroeconomic environment has indeed changed radically over the past few years. We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then – owing to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine – quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation. Looking at the period of low interest rates would hardly help. But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.   Inflation was very low in the past decades. Was that mainly because of the central banks’ sound monetary policy? Or was it partly luck, thanks to globalisation for example?   It was both. After the great inflation of the 1970s, monetary policy changed fundamentally. Central banks have become more independent and have a clearer mandate: price stability. This has increased the credibility of monetary policy. But there have also been macroeconomic trends, particularly globalisation and China’s entry into the world market, which played an important role and brought down inflation.  Has the fight for stable prices got tougher?   Since 2020 there have been several severe external shocks. That makes monetary policy more challenging.   Will inflation be higher in future than it was before?   Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2%. At the same time, we may be confronted with more supply-side shocks. And these could turn out to be inflationary, even though that is hard to predict. Climate change, for example, drives prices, we see that already. Extreme weather can push up food prices, low water levels in the Panama Canal increase transportation costs, and carbon taxes raise the price of fossil fuels. A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well. But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence, which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.   When you joined the Executive Board in 2020 you wanted to smooth the fractious relationship between Germans and the ECB. Did you manage to do so?   The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB. It has enabled us to strengthen the ECB’s credibility.   But the ECB was too slow in combating inflation. Many people haven’t forgotten that.     We acted relatively late, but all the more decisively. We sharply increased interest rates within a short time, and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation. Inflation was initially caused by rising energy prices and disrupted supply chains owing to the pandemic and the war. These constrained aggregate supply, while demand remained robust. Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations. We succeeded in doing that. It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2%.   Inflation has fallen, but the higher prices continue to put pressure on people.  The prices are clearly higher than before the pandemic, and monetary policy cannot roll back that increase. And people would not be better off if we plunged the economy into years of deep recession just to bring the prices back to their old levels.  Would you manage, though?  With massive consequences, but this is not the task of monetary policy. An energy price shock makes an economy that is reliant on energy imports poorer overall. Somebody has to bear those losses.  When you have achieved your 2% inflation target, is there a risk of forgetting that the high level of prices is as good as entrenched now?  We target inflation, not the price level. Also in the past, it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.  The quick and sharp interest rate hikes have led to banks suddenly making record profits. Is this fair?  Our decisions are guided by our price stability mandate. But they have side effects, including their impact on bank profits. Banks have lent money at higher rates, but they have not passed the higher interest rates on to their depositors immediately or in full. But we expect banks’ profits to be under more pressure in the future because banks will face higher funding costs and rising credit default risks, while lending is weakening. Banks would therefore be well-advised to use these short-term profits to build up a buffer against future losses.  But banks tend not to do that, opting to pay out dividends instead. Erring on the side of caution would certainly not hurt the banks.  The high profits are also boosted by the 4% deposit facility rate which banks receive on their excess reserves. The ECB could shrink these deposits by raising the minimum reserve requirement. Why has it not done so?  In July we decided to no longer remunerate the minimum reserves while keeping the minimum reserve requirement at 1% of the minimum reserve base, which consists mainly of customer deposits. The minimum reserve requirement is not an effective way of compensating the remuneration of excess liquidity. Large banks have the highest excess liquidity, smaller banks have less. At the same time, the smaller banks are mostly funded by deposits. This is why they would be disproportionally affected by higher minimum reserve requirements.  By the same token, large banks are subsidised with the deposit rate, because many smaller lenders only have low excess amounts that are remunerated.  Banks are not subsidised. But the effects of our measures do vary. For example, during the pandemic the ECB granted longer-term loans that have strongly benefited smaller banks. At the same time, until recently banks were charged a negative interest for their excess liquidity, and that affected large banks more. There are no banks that are systematically at an advantage or a disadvantage. All banks are important for the transmission of monetary policy.  The ECB could sell all the sovereign bonds – that would solve the excess reserve problem. The ECB’s balance sheet has already shrunk significantly. This will continue in the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity. But the primary monetary policy instrument is ECB policy rates. The reduction of our balance sheet is happening gradually in the background, also to avoid market turbulence. While we are not expecting any, we are not taking any risks.  The ECB is making losses now because it has to pay high interest to banks while holding low-yielding bonds. A central bank that is making losses doesn’t look too good.  Our bond purchases were always guided by monetary policy considerations. Take the pandemic emergency purchase programme. This measure probably averted a serious financial crisis that would have wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s lives. The ECB’s losses cannot be viewed out of context.  But they do damage your reputation.  We always assess whether our measures are proportionate, and losses can damage the central bank’s credibility and independence. In the future, this might lead to a certain reassessment of bond purchases.  How do you assess the ECB’s bond purchases?  Bond purchases can be employed for achieving two distinct goals: price stability on the one hand, and market stabilisation on the other. They were very successful in stabilising the financial markets. But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation. At the time, one problem was the very restrictive fiscal policy. Governments failed to make use of the low interest rate period to invest, and this made life difficult for monetary policy.  The lesson here is that fiscal and monetary policy need to pull together.  When you joined the ECB in 2020, inflation was low, the key interest rate below zero and central banks were making profits. This has all changed. How has it affected you?  I have learnt that the world can change much more quickly than you think. The central bank needs to react swiftly in such situations, and this is a challenge. But I think that we have done pretty well in the past four years.\n",
      "Content 9: Wage cost data in Spain point to an increase of 4.7%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that domestic inflation is resisting and is largely predicated by wages. Do you think wage moderation is required to beat inflation?  A year ago inflation was above 10% and now it is below 3%. Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable, i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation, basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade, and because monetary policy is taking effect. However, average wage growth in the euro area is over 5%, whereas productivity is barely improving. This means that unit labour costs are rising, which adds to inflationary pressures. In 2022 profit margins increased considerably, but this year the increase has been more moderate. This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs, which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.   What will the ECB do in this situation?  We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins, as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2% target. We are keeping a very close eye on this.  The EU is emerging from this crisis better than it did in 2008. What do you think has changed?  We have the experience of what happened in 2008 and the two crises are completely different. The 2008 crisis broke out on the back of extremely high private sector debt levels, which had a significant impact on the banking sector. The response was also very different. For the crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic, there have been no limits to fiscal policy, and this has been accompanied by monetary policy that has also been very expansive. In addition to this, the European Union came up with an action plan for all countries throughout the bloc, providing them with funding through the Next Generation EU programme.  However, the situation has now changed. Almost all income indicators have returned to their pre-pandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation. To this end, the ECB takes action through its monetary policy but we also need to see fiscal policy return to normal.   With euro area inflation at 2.4% in November and euro area GDP stagnating for the past twelve months, how do you explain to people why interest rates are being kept so high?   Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do, which is bring inflation down. Monetary policy operates by tightening financing conditions: higher interest rates affect levels of economic activity. And when economic activity is dampened, inflation slows. Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2%, monetary policy might then start to ease. But it’s still too early for that to happen.   When can we expect to see the first interest rate cuts?   If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time, current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2%. We are data dependent. The data have been favourable but still not enough for us to change our monetary policy. It’s therefore too early to talk about a cut in interest rates.  What do you think about opinions from certain quarters that the ECB is sort of following in the slipstream of the US Federal Reserve?  The US economy’s fundamentals and cycles differ from Europe’s. US fiscal policy has been much more expansive, growth is higher and the rate of unemployment, below 4%, is even lower than in the euro area. With an unemployment rate of 6.5%, our labour market is in good shape, but on the whole the economies are in different situations. As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, what the Federal Reserve does is relevant, but it does not determine the ECB’s monetary decisions.  Do you think that now is the time for completing banking union? This debate always seems to be ongoing but never seems to reach a conclusion.  Completing the banking union is essential if we want full economic and monetary union in Europe. There is one pillar missing: a European deposit insurance scheme. European elections will be held in June 2024, offering another opportunity for this. Completing banking union should be on the future European Commission’s agenda, as should making progress on a fiscal union through the introduction of a common fiscal stabilisation function.  Do you think there is the risk of a recession if, for example, the war in Ukraine drags on?   The ECB does not expect a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But beyond whether or not a recession will occur, the main issue is that Europe’s economy has a structural growth problem. Both our projections and those of the European Commission see very moderate growth of around 1% up until 2026. These potential growth levels are low because productivity is barely improving. Europe needs to import more energy than other global economies. As a result, the energy crisis further exacerbates its competitiveness issues. Structural reforms are therefore necessary. The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, but to achieve growth, other factors must be brought into play.  What would these reforms have to be?  One would be completing banking union, as I mentioned. Clear progress also needs to be made towards the capital markets union, and also in the single market of the European Union. Not much is said about the latter, but we are in a situation where there are hardly any limits on state aid, which creates imbalances between countries, depending on their fiscal position. The focus basically needs to be on Europe's low growth potential, how to increase productivity and the reforms needed to boost growth in the medium term.  Do you think it would be feasible to standardise the formula for the European Union’s Next Generation funds?  The Next Generation funds were a response to the pandemic and had two very positive aspects: the issuance of joint debt and the fact that part of the aid consisted of grants rather than loans. Beyond the clearly positive effects of the programme, it ultimately highlights that we need to complete our economic and monetary union. And to do so it is vital to have a permanent centralised fiscal policy instrument, and to implement structural reforms.  Staying with the European Union, there was an agreement on fiscal rules yesterday. How does the ECB see it?   Markets are calm and interest rates on sovereign debt have even fallen. But this can change relatively quickly in the context of low growth, tight monetary policy and geopolitical risks. That is why it is very important to have a clear framework of common fiscal rules. We welcome that there's an agreement because that reduces uncertainty in the markets.  And what is the ECB calling for?  Our recommendation is that the framework should be simple, transparent, easy to understand and countercyclical. In other words, it should allow fiscal policy to be expansionary in bad times and contractionary in good times. Fiscal action plans need to ensure a prudent and sustained reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in structural deficits. They should also create fiscal space for public investment in digitalisation, climate change or defence, and should provide incentives for structural reforms.  In the end, would you say that the EU has completely ditched austerity?  Sometimes it is not clear what is meant by “austerity”. Fiscal sustainability is essential, and, at the same time, fiscal rules have to allow for countercyclical action. And to be able to increase the public deficit during an economic downturn, countries need to rebuild their fiscal positions and reduce their public deficit when the going is good. Beyond fiscal policy, one basic difference between the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis was the very different monetary policy response, providing liquidity to banks and launching a pandemic asset purchase programme that has ultimately provided immense support to the European economy.  Do you think southern European countries have learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis?  Banking systems are much healthier than they were in the period from 2008 to 2011. And that is a key change. Moreover, these countries have made efforts to become more competitive and have a balance of payments surplus. For example, Greece and Portugal have made very significant budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in the risk premia and the ratings agencies. Many southern European countries have made considerable efforts to improve the sustainability of their public finances in the medium term. That is why it makes no sense to now try to create some kind of north-south divide between EU countries.   One of the most important projects the ECB is currently working on is a digital euro. How is it going and what are its key components?  At the moment, we all have euro banknotes in our wallets. A digital euro would be exactly the same, just on our mobiles. It would basically be the banknotes we have now, but in digital form and also backed by the central bank. We want it to be an additional, alternative means of payment. It is not meant to replace banknotes but to complement them. There would also be a limit on the amount of digital euro you can hold. In other words, it would be a means of payment but not a means of saving. We want a digital euro to be more comparable to banknotes than current accounts.  Do you share the Government’s optimism about the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy has a healthy banking system, which is completely different to how the situation was in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the economy is competitive, with a surplus in the balance of payments. It is important that both are maintained in the future. The external sector, including international tourism, has helped a lot in restoring income to pre-pandemic levels.   Are there any challenges?  Education still needs some work. This affects medium- and long-term growth because there are mismatches between labour supply and demand. The 12% unemployment rate means there is room for improvement in the labour market. Like some other euro area countries, Spain has a high public debt-to-GDP ratio of 110%. It is therefore important that these countries implement a prudent adjustment programme to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP.  All countries are going to face major challenges: economic slowdown, geopolitical risks, a new framework of fiscal rules or higher interest rates. That is why economic policy must be predictable.  The last two questions have a Spanish context. What do you think about Nadia Calviño’s appointment as the next president of the European Investment Bank?   Naturally, as a Spaniard, I think it is positive that Spaniards hold key positions in the European Union. I wish her and the institution all the very best.   And in the same vein, particularly seeing as you have held the post that Calviño now leaves, who would you like to see occupy the position left vacant by her?  It is not my place to comment on domestic affairs. I am sure whoever is appointed will be competent and I wish them every success.\n",
      "Content 10: What is your take on the unexpectedly benign November inflation reading? Does the recent string of downside surprises change your view about the inflation trajectory?  “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” I’m sure you know this famous quote that is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly. This was due to the reversal of the previous supply side shocks and was mainly driven by energy and food prices. Base effects played a significant role. The November flash release was a very pleasant surprise. Most importantly, underlying inflation, which has proven more stubborn, is now also falling more quickly than we had expected. This is quite remarkable. All in all, inflation developments have been encouraging. That said, despite these positive developments, I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely. We continue to expect an uptick over the coming months. There’s going to be a reversal of some fiscal measures and of some base effects, and we cannot exclude that there’s going to be a new price spike in energy or food. Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2% target. Our monetary policy is working. The restrictive policy is contributing to dampening growth in aggregate demand. Economic growth has been weak over the past several quarters, and it’s expected to remain weak this quarter before gradually picking up next year. This period of below-potential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2%. So, I believe we are on track, but we need to remain vigilant.  Are we still on the inflation path you outlined in your September projections?  Let’s see what our December staff projections are going to show. But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2% no later than 2025. This is our main objective.  What is your assessment of growth since the September projections?   Some of the hard data we see are not very good. But some of the soft data are giving us hope. The purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) seem to be bottoming out and they’re even showing a small uptick. Of course, this is from very low levels. But it is in line with our projections. Growth is then expected to pick up gradually next year, mainly due to rising real incomes, which should foster confidence and consumption. All this will depend, to a large extent, on the development of the labour market, which has been very resilient. We have seen that firms have held on to their labour force in spite of weakening economic growth. This is only sustainable if they expect growth to pick up. If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market, this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process. But while we do see some softening in the labour market, we do not expect a significant deterioration or a deep and prolonged recession.  Do you see a risk that the rapid drop in credit demand could exacerbate the downturn?  What we’re seeing is that monetary policy transmission is working. There has been a sharp increase in lending rates and a strong slowdown in loan growth. This is exactly what we wanted to see.  Markets are pricing an early spring rate cut but the ECB has guided for steady rates for several quarters. How do you view this discrepancy?  Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year. Central banks are more cautious, and I would argue they have to be more cautious. After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution. If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a sustainable manner. This should happen no later than 2025.  According to our staff projections, the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame. Transmission is working – lending growth is slowing, the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing. We are right on track. But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation. The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum. We now need to see whether this is sustained. We’ve seen very strong wage growth and weak or even falling productivity, leading to a sharp increase in the growth of unit labour costs. This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular, which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained. We’re going to watch upcoming wage agreements very closely. This will certainly also matter for our monetary policy decisions.  If the current level of restriction is sufficient, does that mean you do not see a need for further rate increases?  The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.  What is sufficiently long? Do you also see several quarters of steady rates?  We need to see more data. There’s first likely going to be an uptick in inflation. So, this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now. And most importantly, we need to see what’s going to happen to underlying inflation, to wage growth, to productivity, to unit profits. In order to be confident that we will sustainably return to our target, we need more time.  Am I reading it correctly that you’re not ruling out a rate cut before mid-year then?  We remain data dependent. That’s the main thing. We have to see what’s going to happen. We have been surprised many times in both directions. So, we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months’ time.   What is your view on the timeframe for ending pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments?  As President Lagarde mentioned, the Governing Council is going to discuss reinvestments under the PEPP in the not-too-distant future and I’ll leave it up to you to interpret what that means. It’s clear that discussion is going to come. It’s also clear that at some point we’re going to fully end PEPP reinvestments. The amounts involved are relatively small and markets are expecting this to happen, so I think it’s not such a big deal.  Am I correctly reading the mood that even if reinvestments end, there is no appetite for outright sales of bonds in either the asset purchase programme (APP) or PEPP portfolios?  We have never discussed outright sales.  You gave a speech in March in which you made the case for a demand-driven system for the ECB’s new operational framework. How has you thinking evolved since?  What I said in that speech is that a demand-driven system is well-suited for a heterogeneous currency union that may be prone to fragmentation. Such a system also likely limits the size of the central bank balance sheet. Of course, it can be designed in many different ways. What we are doing in our framework review is trying to find a system that implements our monetary policy effectively and efficiently in a way that minimises the negative side effects. So, the new system has to take into account the specificities of the euro area financial system. It has to be firmly embedded in our legal framework and it should limit our market footprint. But one should be aware that we are starting from a situation of abundant excess liquidity. So whatever framework we choose, money market rates will initially remain close to the floor.  What is the timeline for the balance sheet to shrink to its optimal size?   That depends on various factors that we can’t project perfectly. It also depends on the framework that we will eventually choose. One of the main drivers of the size of the central bank balance sheet is the growth of what we call autonomous factors – banknotes and official sector deposits – and the growth of reserve requirements. These factors already imply that the balance sheet is going to be around three times as large as before the global financial crisis.  In addition, banks could have a higher demand for excess liquidity for regulatory or precautionary reasons. If the outcome of the review was a demand-driven system, the size of the balance sheet would thus also depend on banks’ demand for excess liquidity. This would mean the size would not be determined by us, which is a good thing, because we don’t know precisely what the demand is.  The Federal Reserve has gone with the floor system. Could two of the world’s biggest central banks operate with different frameworks?  I do not see any problem with that. If you look around the world, you see many different frameworks.  The Fed has a supply-driven floor, the Bank of England a demand-driven floor, and Sveriges Riksbank a narrow corridor, while many central banks in emerging markets have a classical corridor. So, there is a wide variety of models out there that are tailor-made for specific financial systems.    Do you see the need for a structural portfolio of bonds and/or longer-term bank loans? What would the size of such a portfolio need to be?    I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of the framework review. There are different ways to provide liquidity to the financial system and all of them are going to be discussed in the review. We are going to weigh up the benefits and costs of each of them, and it could make sense to have a mix of different tools. We need to keep in mind, though, that this only matters far out in the future, because we are starting from a situation where we have a huge monetary policy bond portfolio. The structure of the balance sheet only becomes relevant when it has to grow again. As regards a structural portfolio, I mentioned in my March speech that this could be considered. Also keep in mind that we de facto already have a structural portfolio because some national central banks are holding bonds in their Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) portfolios.  What do you mean by “far out in the future”? Could it be next decade?  That depends on the decisions we are going to take. If we decided on both longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio, we would have to think about a potential split. But this really depends on many factors and I do not want to make any predictions. What is clear is that the balance sheet has to be much larger than it was before the global financial crisis. But, for all the frameworks under consideration, the balance sheet is going to be much smaller than it is now.  Should the ECB introduce new longer-term refinancing operations?  We will discuss the different options available to provide liquidity to the banks, including longer-term operations. But such a facility would have to be different from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) we were offering during the pandemic, in that it would have to be offered at market rates. From the banks’ perspective, longer-term lending operations are attractive because they provide a certain reliability of funding. And they reach all parts of the banking sector directly. That is very different from asset purchases – when you inject liquidity, it typically ends up with the larger banks and in certain financial centres.  Do you see a case for increasing the minimum reserve requirements, as some of your colleagues advocate?  We had a discussion on minimum reserve requirements in July and we discussed both the calibration and the remuneration. We decided to keep the minimum reserve requirements at 1% but to remunerate them at zero, instead of at the deposit facility rate. The reason for this was proportionality. With this change, we can implement our monetary policy stance in the same way and equally effectively while paying lower interest to the banks. That was the justification for reducing the remuneration. The proportionality argument implies that, if we have two options and one of them leads to losses while the other is just as effective in achieving price stability but reduces these losses, then we should choose the option that generates smaller losses. But let me stress that the minimum reserve requirements are not a tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. They also have distributional effects – they have the greatest impact on the banks with the highest deposit base, which tend to be the smaller banks. We are going to discuss the role of minimum reserve requirements in the operational framework review. And until then, we will not take any decisions.  To what extent should profit and loss considerations matter for monetary policy decisions?  Our monetary policy decisions are determined by our mandate. Profit and loss considerations matter only insofar as they affect our credibility and, consequently, our ability to pursue our mandate.  Andrea Enria argued recently that shadow banks need closer scrutiny, and the ECB could theoretically conduct this supervision. If the ECB supervised them, it could also provide them with access to liquidity facilities. Is that needed?  The experience of the pandemic shows that we are able to distribute liquidity across the financial sector without giving non-banks direct access to our balance sheet. At the moment we are not considering opening up our balance sheet to non-banks because there is no clear case for that.\n",
      "Content 11: Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.   What would you say to those who think that banks are making excessive profits?   The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, which has just been published, indeed shows that bank profitability has risen sharply. This improvement can be attributed to the widening of interest rate margins. The return on equity of euro area banks now stands at around 10%, whereas in 2019, barely five years ago, it stood at 4%. So it has clearly improved.  Still, this is something of an illusion − it is after all a short-term improvement. In the long term, we expect profitability to fall again. Why? There are several factors. First, the economy is slowing, which will lead to higher default rates and a decline in asset quality. Second, banks will have to pay more to attract deposits. On term accounts, for example, interest rates have already risen sharply. Likewise, the bonds that banks issue themselves will need to carry a higher return. So overall the cost of bank funding is on the rise. And finally, an often-overlooked factor is that demand for credit is falling. Putting all that together, you can see that high bank profitability is not sustainable. In fact, the financial markets are already convinced of this, as bank share valuations are in no way reflecting expectations of high profits.  Are the banks sufficiently covered for interest rate risks. If not, could the regulator, the ECB, review its requirements?   The interest rate risk of European banks can’t be compared to that run by some US banks such as Silicon Valley Bank with a different business model. The repricing of loans, in other words, raising interest rates in line with the market rate, has been much faster than the repricing of deposits in Europe. However, the interest rates on deposits will also increase at some point.  So is interest rate risk adequately covered?  Yes, but at the same time banks will be facing a loss of profitability as I said. I am talking about the average for the sector.   There has been a lot of debate about interest rates on savings. Politicians are taking initiatives to get banks to raise interest rates. Is that a good idea?  If the ECB raises interest rates, it is for borrowers and savers. Lending rates have risen and the remuneration of deposits is expected to follow suit. The remuneration on savings accounts should reflect our interest rates. That is part of our monetary policy transmission. Because if savings become more attractive, consumers will spend less, reducing demand. This is what we aim for to push down inflation. However, we now see banks are delaying passing on higher interest rates to savers. They can do that because they still benefit from abundant liquidity right now. But we are also taking measures to reduce excess liquidity, so that higher interest rates on savings accounts will become a reality – sooner or later.  Do you see differences between member states in this respect?  Yes, there are differences. In some countries, banks are quick to adjust interest rates on deposits, and in others, such as Spain, they are lagging behind. Euro area banking sectors also differ in the way mortgage loans are granted, whether it is at variable or fixed rates. Strengthening of profitability was particularly notable for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates and the pass-through of higher policy rates to deposits has been slower.  And Belgium?  I know the Spanish situation because it’s my own country, but we look at euro area averages and developments as a whole.  Some economists criticise the system that allows banks to make money easily by depositing their excess liquidity with the ECB. This is resulting in generous profits at the moment because interest rates are rising. What’s your take on this?  The ECB has raised its interest rates with a view to these increases being passed on to all remuneration categories in bank balance sheets. The level of liquidity in the market was extremely high and had to be reduced. This reduction is under way now and will go hand-in-hand with a decline in these types of revenues for banks.  You have also changed the remuneration of the minimum reserve requirement for banks. Some bankers believe that this should be raised to ensure a stronger capital base. Do you think that’s a good idea?  We have indeed set the remuneration of banks’ minimum reserves to 0%. The levels of those reserves have so far not been changed or discussed. I know some central bank governors are in favour of increasing them. We have limited the remuneration on the minimum reserve requirement, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of banks’ liabilities. I understand that remuneration of reserves is important for some banks, but monetary policy shouldn’t be driven by the financial position of banks or the profits of the central banks. Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.  National central banks are going to have to report significant losses owing to the policy of quantitative easing, which led to huge purchases of sovereign bonds to inject liquidity into the market. Do these losses pose a problem?  It’s true that central banks are currently reporting losses owing to the hike in interest rates, but if we look at a longer period of time, for instance over the last 10 years, the net outcome is positive in terms of central bank profits.  What about the real estate market? People are complaining about the higher cost of loans. What would you say to them?   What is happening is part of our monetary policy. The sharp rise in interest rates is starting to dampen real estate prices. This is more apparent in some countries than others, but a moderation in price trends can be seen everywhere. On average, house prices are stabilising. The decline in commercial property prices is much more pronounced.   Does the situation pose a danger?   It could affect banks, but fortunately they are less exposed to commercial real estate than they are to residential real estate. Commercial real estate is more often financed through other channels, such as mutual funds. But in the financial system there is a high degree of interconnectedness, so we look at the overall picture.  Huge investments are needed to make homes and other buildings climate-proof. Are the higher interest rates delaying funding for investments aimed at combating climate change? Could that slow down the climate transition?  It’s true that substantial investments are needed, but I think they should mainly be financed through subsidies and European funds like the Next Generation EU. This is a matter for fiscal policy. That doesn’t alter the fact that the ECB conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing rates without discriminating between sectors or borrowers.   Monetary policy also affects the climate transition in other ways. Some investments are being jeopardised by higher financing costs. This has already resulted in plans for various wind farms being scrapped.  The ECB pays close attention to climate policy, but for us it’s a secondary objective. It’s national governments that play the leading role in climate policy, through taxes and subsidies. We can contribute though – and we do. For example, we prioritise climate-friendly companies in our corporate bond portfolio. This is a small contribution, but it sends a clear signal in the fight against climate change.  The ECB is preparing to introduce a digital euro. Why is that necessary?  We currently have a physical euro in our wallets, whereas the world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. There is a very natural evolution taking place from a physical to a digital euro backed by the central bank. We see the digital euro as a means of payment. We would be able to use this form of public money to pay for our shopping, our bill in a restaurant or all sorts of purchases. Like banknotes, the digital euro will not have to be remunerated. There will be a limit on the amount of digital euro people can hold, to avoid endangering the stability of the banking system. This means that the digital euro won’t compete with current accounts. That is a very clear message we want to send to the banking sector. The digital euro will not be an investment product but a simple means of payment to complement banknotes.  Won’t implementing the digital euro be very expensive for the ECB?  This will be part of our calculations during the preparation phase over the next two years, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted but, in my view, the benefits will outweigh the costs. It will offer another alternative means of payment to those living in the euro area. It will also enable us to take another step towards European strategic autonomy. And at the end of the preparation phase the decision will be taken by the European Commission, the European Council of the European Union and European Parliament.  A number of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, are struggling with how inflation is measured. The way it’s measured means actual inflation is sometimes overestimated and sometimes underestimated. Isn't that a problem for the ECB, as it’s tasked with fighting inflation?  Indeed, changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated. But that's a matter for Eurostat, not the ECB, and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward. Statistical changes to the compilation of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) occur from time to time. A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not. As you know, that was one of the conclusions of our monetary policy strategic review. We work and share information with Eurostat on that topic, with a view to enhancing the HICP. But not on the measurement of energy prices, which is a statistical choice to how the country’s price index is compiled.  Europe is planning to use the profits from frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear to help rebuild Ukraine. The ECB is critical of this. Can you explain why?  Let me first clarify that the ECB is in favour of helping and supporting Ukraine in any way possible. But our position on utilising the dividends and interest from the frozen assets is clear. First: this should be a global decision, ideally involving all members of the G7. In addition, we have to be careful because this could lead to reputational damage. We have to look beyond this conflict in isolation, and there could be implications for the euro as a safe currency. The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation. I think there are other ways to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In Belgium, the launch of the ethical bank NewB has proved very difficult. Are barriers to setting up new banks in the eurozone too high?  Without entering into the details of any particular case, there are different procedures to be followed and criteria to be met, but there are no limitations beyond the legal and capital requirements imposed for the creation of a new retail bank.  But there haven’t been very many new banks in the last few years...  Because there are a lot of banks in the euro area! The real question to ask is about banks’ traditional business model. New sources of revenue need to be found, the number of branches has to be reduced. I suppose that investors are turning away from banks because the level of profitability doesn’t meet their expectations. I think there needs to be further cross-border consolidation.  So are there too many banks?  Given the cost structure of European banks, consolidation could help provide a solution. Above all else, I think cross-border consolidation in the euro area under a single supervisor and within the framework of a single monetary policy would be positive.\n",
      "Content 12: The ECB did not change its key interest rates at its October meeting, interrupting the series of ten consecutive interest rate increases that had brought rates up by 4.5 percentage points since July 2022. A few days later Eurostat announced that euro area headline inflation had fallen to 2.9% in October. Does this mean that interest rate hikes are over?  It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level, and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2% level we define as price stability.  The evolution of inflation has been positive overall: it was above 10% only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9%. At the same time, core inflation has also been moderating. But we have to be prudent and cautious, as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months. We will continue taking a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions.   Euro area GDP was down by 0.1% in the third quarter, and economists think inflation may rise again over the coming months as the positive base effect will progressively fade out. At the same time, there is a risk of another commodity price shock arising from the situation in the Middle East. If the ECB finds itself at a crossroads, will it prioritise growth or inflation?  Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2%. Unlike some other central banks, the ECB does not have a dual mandate.  At the same time, we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation. We expect that growth will stagnate in the second half of the year and that the fourth quarter will not differ much from the third. Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth; some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.  Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025, with some fluctuations caused by base effects. However, we believe that, if interest rates are maintained at their current levels, inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.   The ECB will publish new forecasts in December. Will these be more or less the same as in September, or are you expecting upward revisions for inflation and downward revisions for growth?   It might be premature to say it, but leading indicators point to the growth outlook being somewhat more negative than we previously projected. As regards inflation, the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.  You mentioned the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to decision-making. But in October the ECB said it considers its key interest rates to be at levels that will make a substantial contribution to lowering inflation, provided they are maintained at those levels for a sufficiently long duration. What is meant by “sufficiently long”?  This means a period of time that takes into account the potential lags of monetary policy. Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive, and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down, as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was. I would not define “sufficiently long” as used in our monetary policy statement as a concrete period of time. We will need to determine this on the basis of data. In our decision-making we will also have to take into account the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical risks related to the conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine.  But what kind of data would the ECB need to see to start reducing interest rates rather than simply keeping them at restrictive levels?  We are not there yet. We will see how things evolve month by month, but our approach now is to keep interest rates at this level long enough to reach our target. Any discussion about lowering interest rates is clearly premature.  To what extent did the ECB’s monetary policy take into account not just the euro area average but the situation in individual Member States, as there are significant differences among them, also in their level of inflation. According to Eurostat, in October Slovakia recorded the highest inflation rate of 7.8%, Slovenia registered 6.6%, while the Netherlands and Belgium recorded deflation of 1% and 1.7% respectively.  We have seen disparities among euro area countries in their economic and financial structures, in the weight of services in their economies and not least in their proximity to the conflict in Ukraine.      There are always differences in inflation and growth, but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries. Our measure of price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.  In dealing with the disparities, it is important to consider the effects of fiscal policies. With regard to base effects, we have to look at how governments have introduced, and have started to withdraw, support measures to mitigate the shocks of the energy crisis. Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries. But our monetary policy is single.  The ECB is now looking more closely, in line with other central banks, at core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. What are ECB’s main concerns in this regard? ECB President Christine Lagarde said this summer that profit margins contributed almost two-thirds to domestic inflation last year. Almost nobody mentions this anymore, but there is now a discussion about the effects of wage increases.   It is essential to focus on core inflation, for which there are several risks. First, there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation. Second, there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate, which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation. And finally, there are unit labour costs. Rising labour costs result from two factors. The first one is wage developments, with wage growth in the euro area now at just over 5%. The second is productivity, which is very low and has been declining because employment growth has been outpacing output growth.  It is true that profit margins grew even faster than unit labour costs last year. This year, however, we are seeing a moderation in profit margins, while labour costs are on the rise.  Our expectation is that part of the increase in labour costs will be absorbed via profit margins, meaning that not all of this increase will be passed through to final prices.   At the ECB, you are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to deepen your understanding of inflation. What will you do differently from what you have been doing so far and what do you hope to achieve? We know that, while not the only one, you have been wrong as far as the inflation forecast is concerned.   Our colleagues working with statistics deal with a lot of information, a lot of data on the financial system and the real economy, so any instrument that helps us manage this monumental amount of information is very useful.  So we are continually looking for algorithms that can give us a better understanding of what is happening in the economy, in the financial system, and a way of factoring in all the underlying tendencies that are embedded in the data we analyse.   There have been warnings that in its fight against inflation the ECB has been focusing only on the demand side of the economy, while supply-side factors also contribute to inflation. Is a more balanced approach warranted for the future, bearing in mind the pressures that may stem from geopolitical tensions, the demographic picture and the implications of the Green Deal? The economy has already been disrupted, is monetary policy next?  Sometimes it is important to stress that monetary policy works through interest rate increases, through the transmission of monetary policy decisions to financing conditions and then through the impact of financing conditions on aggregate demand.  So, monetary policy and the transmission of its decisions aim to influence aggregate demand, consumption and investment. Monetary policy cannot deal with supply-side issues. These need to be addressed through structural policies and fiscal policies.  Let me add that it’s not only the origin of inflation that’s important, but also the possibility of second-round effects, which can make the situation much more complicated, with a possible price-wage-profit spiral. In particular, we need to avoid de-anchoring inflation expectations, as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.  It was announced a while ago that the ECB, in cooperation with Eurostat, would include housing costs in the calculation of inflation. How far along is this project?  This was part of the ECB’s strategy review, and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation. However, such costs need to be well calibrated in the index, and this is mainly Eurostat’s responsibility. Including the cost of owner-occupied housing in the measurement – known as the owner-occupied property cost – contributes to the calibration of inflation. We are very willing to cooperate with Eurostat and provide our input and insights.   So there is no deadline?  It is not up to us. But there is a need for harmonised action at EU level, not just in the euro area, and this takes time.   The ECB has dealt with record-high euro area inflation by raising interest rates at a record pace. In the banking systems of several countries, including Slovenia, borrowers have felt the effects of this policy much more than savers. Is this also due to the consolidation of the banking market and the subsequent lack of competition?   You are right about the effects. As you know, we have made it crystal clear: whenever we raise our key interest rates, this increase should be passed on to all sides of the market.  The current situation can be explained by several factors. First, there is excess liquidity, so banks haven’t been under pressure to raise the remuneration of deposits. However, liquidity conditions are becoming less and less comfortable for European banks – there have been changes to the parameters for long-term liquidity lending to banks under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and changes to our bond-buying programmes, so the decline in liquidity will continue. Second, banks are always slower to change their pricing policy for deposits than they are for loans.  But there is a slow-but-steady increase in the remuneration of deposits, particularly time deposits. We believe that this process will continue. We are monitoring it very closely and, I’ll say it again, when we raise interest rates, we are not only raising them for borrowers, but for savers too, because otherwise the transmission of monetary policy would be incomplete.   Given that deposit interest rates lagging behind lending rates has resulted in considerable growth in banks’ net interest income, could you say that banks are pursuing short-term goals instead of long-term sustainable business goals, especially as you said yourself that the ECB is now determined to reduce excess liquidity in the system?  You’re right – the profitability of European banks has improved recently owing to the increase in key interest rates and an improvement in profit margins.  However, this has not been reflected in the market valuation of banks because markets believe that this improvement in profitability may not be sustainable over time. First, because the economy is slowing, which could lead to an increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Second, because the drop in demand for loans would reduce banks’ revenues. And third, because the cost of funding for banks is rising.  So I think that it’s quite obvious that, despite the improved profitability of banks, there are doubts about how sustainable this will be in the longer term.   What are the challenges to financial stability in the euro area now that we are in a phase of economic slowdown? What is the situation regarding insolvency proceedings, non-performing loans and risks to the banking system stemming from the real estate market? In Germany, residential property prices fell by around 10% in the second quarter. Do you expect a correction elsewhere as a consequence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening?  When interest rates go up, the financial stability situation changes. The first factor we have to look at is valuations of financial assets and real estate assets. One of the main risks we see in terms of financial stability in the euro area is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment of asset prices and the implications it could have for banks. It should be stressed that banks are in a good position in terms of profitability, capital and liquidity. But we cannot be complacent because, as I said, there are some doubts about how sustainable this improvement is going to be over time.  There is another factor for financial stability. We look very carefully at non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly real estate mutual funds. In this regard, we have seen a significant drop in commercial real estate valuations. This decline had set in before the start of the monetary policy tightening but has now accelerated following the rise in interest rates. A number of non-bank financial intermediaries have seen very steep declines, particularly in commercial real estate.  In addition to economic cooling, we are also witnessing a housing crisis across the EU. How do you respond to the criticism that the ECB’s monetary policy has contributed to this, first with bond purchases that lowered bond yields, which led institutional investors to turn to the property market for returns, and now by increasing borrowing costs, which has caused many building projects to be postponed or completely abandoned?  We can be criticised for being too lenient or for being too tough. But, if I may say, I don’t think it’s fair to be criticised for both things at the same time. There were reasons why we had a very expansionary monetary policy – think back to the pandemic and the decline in GDP. I think that without our monetary policy, the situation would have been much worse. Going back even further, to the era of quantitative easing, you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis. However, sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge, and we had to respond.  Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability. Sometimes there are lateral effects. But there are also other policies to deal with a potential real estate bubble, such as fiscal and macroprudential policies.   In other words, you are looking at developments in the real estate market through the prism of the financial stability of the banking system.  For sure. My point is that monetary policy has to be focused on price stability. However, there are other instruments available, like fiscal and other policies. In the event of real estate market growth that is not fully aligned with fundamentals, macroprudential policies can be applied, bank capital buffers can be increased and borrower-based measures can be used to limit excessive growth in real estate lending. A range of policies are available.   What are the latest trends in the credit situation in the euro area?  The evolution is quite clear: financing conditions have tightened as a result of our monetary policy decisions, resulting in a decline in credit demand, which can be seen for both households and firms. This is how monetary policy works.   My last question is on the tax issue. Banks are reporting high profits, largely due to higher net interest income. As a result, several governments have decided to levy additional taxes on them. Why is the ECB not in favour?  Our decision is based on two pillars. The first is that this kind of tax should not impair lending or the transmission of monetary policy measures to the system. The second is that such a tax should not damage the solvency of banks, as this could have medium-term consequences for banks that are not well capitalised.  We have already issued opinions for Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and now Slovenia. The taxes are not all the same, but each opinion points out that the tax should not impair lending and should not damage the solvency of banks.\n",
      "Content 13: When you were in Athens last week, you talked about Greece’s resilience and its phenomenal recovery capacity. Could you tell me how this happened? How did Greece become a success story?  When I look at the key performance indicators for assessing Greece’s economic and financial situation, I see improvements across the board: in employment, growth, the fiscal situation and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Greece has completed many of the reforms on its to-do list. Not all of them, of course. There is still more work to be done. I understand that there are more reforms in the pipeline but, overall, the results of the country’s efforts are impressive. And this did not go unnoticed by those whose job it is to rate an economy and assess its credit rating – as shown by the two recent decisions that raised Greece’s rating to investment grade. I think it’s a tremendous testament to the country’s efforts. The turnaround was thanks to the fiscal adjustments and the reforms that were implemented, but also to the resolute efforts of the Greek people and the Greek authorities.  Is the high debt-to-GDP ratio of any concern to you?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is around 160% at the moment. It has fallen significantly in the last couple of years. And obviously this downward trend needs to continue in the future. I know there is more to come, but Greece has evidently responded to this challenge with determination, and the results are already clear to see.  Did you ever get really worried about Grexit? Did you think that it was possible?  There were two particular moments where the threat could have materialised. The first was during the French G20 presidency in November 2011, when there was talk of a possible referendum, which didn’t happen in the end. The second, when the threat was much more tangible and much more worrying, was in July 2015. So, we had two Grexit threats, but the one in 2015 was the most concrete, and if it hadn’t been for the determination of a few European leaders, it would have happened.  You had a front-row seat to the Greek financial crisis from a very early stage. When you look back, do you think that any mistakes were made?  The original mistake was for the country to have found itself in that situation. If there had been greater fiscal discipline and if the prudent principle of establishing a rainy-day fund for bad times when the economy was doing well had been applied, the crisis might not have happened. The fiscal policies in place before and after the crisis hit in 2009 were the original mistakes. As I have said before, it would have been helpful for the IMF to have had longer programmes than those available in its arsenal. The programmes it had were intended for rapid and deep changes, reforms and fiscal consolidation. At the time they weren’t necessarily the best tools for a country that was in a monetary union without a fiscal union or for Greece’s specific fiscal situation.  Did you learn any lessons or draw any conclusions of your own from the crisis?  One very pertinent lesson is to make sure that we have the collective discipline to address the lack of a fiscal union. I think this should be a very pressing concern for all of us. When you have a monetary union without a fiscal union, as we do, you need clear fiscal guardrails and a fiscal framework within which countries can design and implement their fiscal policies and be accountable to the other members of the monetary union. Something else that stands out from the Greek situation is that decisions were made but then sometimes reversed by the subsequent political team. And, even when decisions were taken, the implementation and monitoring needed to move forward didn’t always happen. Another lesson is that, even when banks are not the cause of a crisis, a solid and robust financial sector with well-capitalised banks is crucial.  Are you satisfied with the current state of the Greek banking system?  I think a lot of work has been done to consolidate and strengthen the Greek banking sector. Take non-performing loans, for example. In 2016 almost 50% of loans were non-performing. Now it is just over 8%. That is a significant sign of improvement, which has involved parking those non-performing loans outside the banks. So, in a way, the banking system has been sanitised. Capital ratios are much stronger, non-performing loans have gone down and liquidity ratios are also quite solid. So yes, a lot has been done to make Greek banks more robust and more attractive.  I think the fact that a large foreign bank is taking an interest in a Greek bank is a clear indication that the sector has become more attractive.  Do you think 10 or 12 years ago it would have been possible for you and the Governor of the Bank of Greece Yannis Stournaras to take a walk around Syntagma Square where all the demonstrations were happening? What was going through your mind when you actually did it this time?  I was totally bemused by the transformation, I have to tell you. As you know, I did not come to Greece at the height of the crisis, but I was obviously in frequent contact with the team. I was following the IMF mission’s visits very closely – special security measures were taken and it was a source of anxiety and concern. Now, to walk down the street, say hello to people and feel their energy, vitality and optimism was quite striking. It is a testament to the effort and the determination of the Greeks to turn things around and to take hold of their destiny with the discipline and seriousness required in a union like the EU. I think it’s fantastic that Greece can set standards and be an example of what to do, of what reforms to implement.  Do you have the sense that economic events are driven by geopolitics these days? How hard is it to carry out fiscal and, more importantly, monetary policy?  You and I have been around for a little while. And I think that geopolitics taking precedence over many other developments is nothing new. What I think is slightly different now is that there is a compounded effect of multiple geopolitical developments taking place in various corners of the world. Sometimes they are a reflection of a major schism happening in front of us. When the world had a bipolar power structure, when it was fairly organised and settled, you could anticipate things. You could have more certainty about future developments. Now it’s far more fragmented. Crises are taking place in various parts of the globe at the same time, and it’s not clear who is on whose side and what the next development will be, let alone the final outcome of the current crisis in the Middle East. And if you add to that the crisis that we have just gone through with the pandemic, plus the terribly serious challenge of climate change, which is a tragedy that is already unfolding, that’s a lot of geopolitical and climate-related developments taking place together. That’s what’s making it even harder at the moment, which is why I think that we are confronted with shifts and breaks that, although not unimaginable, certainly fly in the face of the traditional way of thinking or the certainties that we used to have.  Do you think that inflation will recede next year?  This is certainly our forecast and this is certainly our goal. We are determined to bring inflation down to 2%. According to our projections we will get there in 2025.  It seems as though increases in food prices and housing are almost becoming structural now. Are you worried about the political implications of all this, about the political pressures stemming from the rise in the cost of living?  When we measure inflation, we pay attention to the headline rate, which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing – how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car, food on the table, or to have clothes, shelter and everything else. But we also try to understand what is underneath the most variable components. One of those components is food. Is the price of food going to be higher in the future? That’s a possibility if you look at the impact of climate change, for example. Droughts, floods, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will most likely have an impact on food prices going forward .  As for the political implications that you asked me about, let me say that our mandate is to ensure price stability, and this is the best contribution we can make to social peace and to society, to the most vulnerable of its members in particular.  The last question I’d like to ask you is what really keeps you up at night?  I try to sleep as much as I can, and at the moment it’s not a lot, I have to say. When I go to bed, I’m really tired and I fall asleep. But what preoccupies me before I go to bed is the level of violence, hatred and hubris around, which is first and foremost terrible for people – terrible for children and terrible for civilians. And of course, in addition to the human suffering, all this will have an impact on our economies, on the level of people’s confidence, and it will probably make our job a little bit harder going forward.\n",
      "Content 14: Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.  First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.  What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?  This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.  Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?  What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.  Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.  We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.  QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?  We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate. This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.  Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?   Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.  So no lowering of interest rates until spring?  We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.  And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?  Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.   As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?  I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty. And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.  Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?  I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.\n",
      "Content 15: The ECB raised its key interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in fourteen months, bringing the rate on the deposit facility to 4%, its highest level since the launch of the euro. Coming at a time when people are concerned about the level of interest rates, was this move justified?   We first need to put the action taken by the European Central Bank into context. For several years now the world has been facing a “permacrisis”, a constant succession of serious and unprecedented crises − in terms of their scale, their impact and the speed at which they emerged. The health crisis was followed by Russia’s unjustified war in Ukraine, and then by an acceleration in inflation. All this against the backdrop of the energy crisis, with a number of EU countries experiencing difficulties in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, including real estate.  The ECB’s mandate, unchanged for 25 years, is price stability. It’s our compass. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.     Do you have the tools you need to fight inflation?   Our models were not perfectly suited to the nature of these crises, which resulted, among other things, in the complete shutdown of part of the economy during the health crisis, leading to a greater role for governments, which suddenly became protective. They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades, or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation. The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections. We have worked on these issues, and we are continuing to do so, in order to make the projections more robust.   Have the past projection errors dented trust in the ECB’s actions?    Close to 80% of euro area citizens believe in and support the euro. And 45% trust the ECB, slightly more than did so before the health crisis. But we are constantly seeking effective methods and better channels of communication to explain our actions and counter fake news, which spreads far more quickly than the facts, also in the economic world. The ECB was the first central bank to acknowledge its errors with regard to the projections and to analyse the reasons for them.   And what are these reasons?  The errors were largely caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. Growth has declined across all economies – in advanced, emerging and developing countries. And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world, apart from in China. A very worrying situation, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6% in October 2022, more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3%. That means that within one year, the efforts made – along with base effects, i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago – have slowed the pace of inflation.  But that’s not the general feeling in Europe…  It’s hard to explain that the rise in prices is slowing down. Inflation persists, but it is abating and even steadily declining. That’s good news. I think our efforts have played a part in this, as have some of the economic policies pursued in Europe. At the same time, growth is weakening, which is why the International Monetary Fund has revised down its growth projections worldwide, except for the United States.  Why this gap with Europe?    Potential growth in the United States has traditionally exceeded that of Europe or of the euro area by close to 1 percentage point on average. It’s not meaningful to compare them: you can’t compare a single country with several countries. The euro area comprises 20 different countries, 20 different fiscal policies, 20 different treasuries. For a start, the United States is protected by the dollar, an international reference currency. The US economy is far more responsive and adjusts more rapidly. And it is not energy-dependent, unlike Europe, which has to import 80% of its energy.   Growth is falling in Europe. Is there a risk of recession?  We have revised down our growth projections to 0.7% in 2023, 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. The rate for 2025 is only slightly below the potential growth of the euro area. In Europe, we have devised a response and deployed unprecedented defensive measures that would have been unimaginable just three years ago, notably thanks to the Next Generation EU programme. Structural reforms are being put in place. And, just one year ago, who would have thought that we would succeed in replenishing more than 90% of our gas reserves by September 2023? This allows us to look towards the coming winter, if not calmly, then at least with a lot more confidence.   The German economy, the largest in the euro area, is slowing down sharply. What impact will this have?  This is one of the factors that is indeed weighing on the outlook for European growth. Germany had built its economic model on very cheap energy supplies and on export opportunities, especially to China. The ongoing adjustment in the German economy is affecting the growth outlook.   Does that complicate the ECB’s mission?  First and foremost, the ECB has to answer the question of how to provide price stability for economic actors across the entire euro area. To this end, we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area, as well as underlying inflation – excluding energy and food.  In France, people are acutely aware of inflation. Why is that?  High and persistent inflation affects people’s purchasing power. But overall, while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average, for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.  Is this also due to the rise in interest rates?  Not exclusively. The ECB rates are the same for France as for all euro area countries. We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.  Doesn’t this threaten growth?  Our mandate is price stability, and interest rates are our tool. We raise rates to make the financing of economic activity more expensive in a manner that dampens demand, and to thus bring about an adjustment between supply and demand, notably through reduced investment and consumption. The goal is obviously not to create a recession, but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and, above all, prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral. We must avoid this at all costs. We want to get inflation back to 2%, and we will achieve that.  Is there a risk of a wage-price spiral?  We aren’t seeing that for the moment, but we are monitoring it closely. Wage growth is expected to be around 5.3% in the euro area in 2023, and that figure is projected to be 4.3% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2% over the coming years.  Is the housing crisis that is picking up pace in France and Germany collateral damage from monetary policy?  The ECB sets the key interest rates in view of its price stability mandate. The housing sector is indeed sensitive to interest rates. But for many of the problems, all authorities need to get around the table and think about the stock of housing supply, and about social housing in particular. The fact remains that the major risk would be if people get into debt without having adequate means and are then confronted with repayment deadlines they cannot meet.  Is the ECB pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook?  There are three reasons why we are not pessimistic. We expect growth figures to increase next year. Inflation is currently falling significantly. And the employment rate is higher than it’s ever been in Europe, and it’s stabilising at that level. The big question right now concerns businesses. Will they accept absorbing part of the salary increases that will be negotiated this year and next in their margins – which didn’t change much in 2022? This is a key question. In our economic projections, we assume that businesses will behave as they have done during previous crises, in that they will reduce their margins a little in order to absorb part of the salary increases. The fall in demand should point them in that direction. It’s in their interest to do so, as public opinion will put them under pressure, as will the public authorities. The second element that is very important is energy prices. I think we have to get used to the idea that oil prices will remain high. This should spur us to pursue the fight against climate change even more vigorously, and to shift towards an energy mix that is less dependent on fossil fuels and foreign suppliers.  Anxiety is growing in European society in the face of a number of measures taken to fight climate change. How should we react?  We cannot wait. Combating climate change is imperative – we should all be hammering that message home. Everyone needs to realise it’s an emergency. We will only achieve this energy transition if we have everyone’s support, and with distributive policies that don’t worsen inequality. We cannot allow the energy transition to fail. Nor can we allow the consequences of climate change to become long-lasting. That is not an option. We have to find the fiscal and social means to make it as painless as possible for everyone, and for the most vulnerable in particular. A collective approach is needed. If there is any area where Europeans should borrow collectively, invest and share the burden as equally as possible, it’s the fight against climate change.  What will follow the current version of the Stability and Growth Pact?  I hope the European Heads of State or Government and the finance ministers will reach an agreement before the end of the year. The sooner there is an agreement on a reformed fiscal framework, the earlier we have clarity on the path of fiscal policies going forward.\n",
      "Content 16: From the ECB's perspective, have the new [September inflation] data brought about any changes in terms of the drivers of inflation growth?    Overall, the recent news on inflation is encouraging. Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably, and it now stands at 4.3% after peaking at 10.6% in October of last year. A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks, as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly. It is also a consequence of statistical effects, the so-called base effects, given that we had unusually large price increases a year ago. When it comes to core inflation, which excludes energy and food, it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5% in the euro area, hence above headline inflation. However, its September print was lower than expected.  It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly, but it is still well above our target of 2%, which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, that “last kilometre” may well prove to be the hardest.  How worrying is the oil price increase that we have witnessed in recent months?  The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on, because we could have new supply side shocks stemming, for instance, from energy or food prices. This year, we’ve experienced frequent extreme weather events, which may have an impact on harvests and lead to higher food prices next year. In addition, the base effects from energy may eventually reverse, putting upside pressure on inflation. Therefore,  we must not be complacent, and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.  What does it mean for the broad expectations among economists, the financial markets and even among central banks, that there will be no need for further interest rate hikes? That’s at least how the latest ECB messages have been interpreted.  One has to look carefully at what we communicated. We said that our decisions will continue to be data dependent. Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2%. However,  we cannot say that we are at the peak or for how long rates will need to be kept at restrictive levels. This will depend on the data, so we will continue to look at three factors: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all of them are moving in the right direction. But I still see upside risks to inflation. There could be new supply side shocks. Moreover, wages could grow more strongly than expected, potentially accompanied by lower-than-expected productivity growth, while firms might not absorb those higher costs through their profit margins. Such risks need to be monitored carefully. If they materialised, further interest rate hikes could be necessary at some point.  Even though inflation has slowed considerably, there are still major differences in inflation rates among countries, ranging from negative numbers in the Netherlands to almost 9% in Slovakia. To what extent do these differences affect the setting of monetary policy? Are they really taken into account?  Our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. Naturally, our monetary policy decisions also take into account information from individual Member States, but we cannot respond to specific developments in a particular country. Such developments are best tackled by national policies, such as fiscal or structural policies. The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation. There are several reasons for the large role played by energy: First, countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation. Second, governments responded differently to the energy price shock, with some governments imposing price controls, which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on. Of course, these measures also had different fiscal implications, because some of them expire automatically when energy prices fall, while others need to be actively reversed, which typically takes longer. And finally, the institutional characteristics of energy markets differ across Member States. In some of them, wholesale energy prices translate quickly into retail prices, both when energy prices rise and fall. In other countries the response is more sluggish due to the fact that there are fixed-price contracts in place with a long duration. One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices, which constitute a large share of the consumption basket. This heterogeneity complicates our monetary policy, but we nevertheless need to focus on the euro area as a whole.  The government in Croatia, as well as in some other countries, is trying to introduce price controls on energy and certain basic consumer items. What is your view of these measures, what are the good and the bad sides of such an approach to lowering inflationary pressures?  Measures that directly control prices, such as price caps, have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which may be reversed once the measures are lifted. This helps to smooth inflation over time, but it also distorts the steering effect of prices. This may be counterproductive, because it does not incentivise lower consumption, for example, of energy. In addition, such measures can weigh heavily on the fiscal budget, especially if they are broad-based rather than targeting the more vulnerable groups. In general, measures that increase the supply capacity are preferable to those that directly control prices.  But do they work in the short run?  In the short run, they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation, which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers, as these often depend on current developments in inflation. But overall, the negative effects often outweigh the positive.   One of the problems in Croatia, which has one of the highest inflation rates in the euro area, seems to lie in ample excess liquidity in the banking sector. This has increased strongly since Croatia joined the euro area on account of banks’ lower minimum reserve requirements. The argument is that this impedes the transmission of higher ECB interest rates and prevents a stronger impact on inflation. What do your analyses on the success of monetary policy transmission in Member States indicate?  What matters for monetary policy in a currency union is excess liquidity at the euro area level and not at the country level. Excess liquidity in the euro area is very high, but this does not impede monetary policy transmission. We have seen that the increases in our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, have been fully transmitted to the money market and have translated into a measurable increase in funding costs in the economy. But you are right, monetary policy transmission can play out differently across Member States. One crucial factor is the prevalence of variable versus fixed-rate loans. The average lending rates adjust more quickly if there is a higher share of loans with a variable interest rate. Croatia is a special case, given that it joined the euro just recently. The drop in minimum reserve requirements from a level of 9% to 1% led to an increase in excess liquidity in the system. However, the strong loan growth that we are seeing in Croatia is not related to this but to the relatively strong economic performance, which is partly driven by the boom in tourism. That is why the Croatian National Bank decided to further increase the countercyclical capital buffer for banks to counter excessive loan growth. This is another way of dealing with the heterogeneity in a currency union, using macroprudential tools at the national level.  Would that be in the national central bank’s domain?  Yes, these macroprudential tools are mainly decided at national rather than European level – in Croatia’s case by the central bank – so they can be adjusted to the specific situation in a given country.   Do you see tourism as the main contributor to economic growth and credit activity in Croatia?  It is definitely one of the factors driving growth in Croatia’s economy. It has always been a very attractive place for summer holidays, and its attractiveness has probably increased since it joined the euro area. Two of my daughters, for example, travelled to Croatia recently, not only because it is beautiful, but also because it now has the euro.  The general public is concerned by the fact that banks are faring the best under the current circumstances, because they are generating high income from central banks without any effort or risk.   This is related to the high volume of excess liquidity created by our previous monetary policy actions: the lending operations and bond purchases, which we call quantitative easing. Excess liquidity is remunerated at our deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. In line with our interest rate tightening, we have now started to shrink our balance sheet, and this is happening very quickly, even though the balance sheet is still very large.  We need to pay interest on reserves, at least at the margin, to make sure that short-term money market rates are closely anchored to our policy rate and therefore in line with our intended monetary policy stance. Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control. Now, what seems to create most of the unease is that banks raised their lending rates much more quickly than they passed these increases on to their depositors. But this transmission is getting stronger. Rates on time deposits have risen quite a bit, and we also see that people are beginning to shift their funds out of sight deposits into alternative investments that pay higher interest rates.  This market mechanism eventually forces banks to adjust their deposit rates. But this also means that banks’ funding costs will go up over time. Even though the impact on profitability is very positive in the short run, longer-term consequences of higher interest rates on bank profitability may well prove to be less benign, because the interest income on bank assets may rise more slowly than their funding costs.  The ECB recently abolished the remuneration paid to banks on minimum reserves, but there are proposals for an increase in the minimum reserve requirement ratio at euro area level to reduce liquidity in the system. What is your view on this?     In July, we had a comprehensive discussion on the minimum reserve requirements and their remuneration. We came to the conclusion that, from a monetary policy perspective, it would be appropriate to keep them at a level of 1% but to remunerate them at 0% instead of applying the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. Let me stress three points.  First, our main tool for adjusting our monetary stance is our policy rates and not minimum reserve requirements. Second, minimum reserve requirements are linked to the volume of deposits, which means that they mainly affect banks with high holdings of deposits rather than those with high holdings of excess liquidity. Therefore, they tend to put a larger burden on smaller banks. Also, these higher reserve requirements may lead to “avoidance strategies” by banks, which could remunerate deposits by even less or shift them to entities outside the euro area, where there are no minimum reserve requirements. Lastly, we are currently discussing the design of our future operational framework for monetary policy implementation. As long as we do not know the role that minimum reserve requirements will play in this new framework, we should be cautious about making any far-reaching decisions.  In any case, the reduction of excess liquidity through the shrinking of our balance sheet will continue for some time and, eventually, all our asset purchase programmes will go into full run-off.   Economic growth prospects have worsened quite substantially, with the possibility of recession not being excluded from forecasts. What is your understanding of the drivers and the consequences of this recent deterioration in the business climate?  Over recent months, we have seen that most economic indicators point to a slowing growth momentum. We first saw a pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector, which started to spread to the services sector as the reopening effects from the pandemic faded. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for manufacturing are in deeply contractionary territory, and those for services are also signalling contraction. Consumer confidence has increased notably over the past year but remains at low levels. All this is pointing to subdued economic developments over the rest of this year.  While a technical recession cannot be excluded, there are no indications of a deep or prolonged downturn. One reason is the labour market, which is still quite resilient, resulting in strong nominal wage growth. As inflation falls, real incomes are rising, which supports economic growth going forward. What is clear is that our monetary policy will continue to have a dampening effect on economic growth.  So, there is no reason for concern of a deeper recession setting in?    We see indications of a period of stagnation but not of a deep or prolonged recession.  Still, the state of the economy in Germany, as a country that is a very important export market for many EU Member States, is not encouraging. How justified are the claims that Germany is currently the “sick man of Europe”?   Germany is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. Its economy has been hit twice: by the energy price shock and by weaker growth in China. This has exposed structural weaknesses linked to the dependence on cheap energy and on a booming economy in China that was eager to buy German manufacturing products. On top of this, Germany faces challenges regarding demographic developments, as it has a rapidly ageing society implying an increasing scarcity of labour, as well as the green transition which, as in many other countries, is facing political obstacles. Cyclical factors, i.e. weak domestic and foreign demand, will eventually fade, but the structural factors may weigh on potential growth and hence have longer-term effects. All this implies that  Germany, as is the case with many other countries, will need to adjust its business model to the changing global conditions, as well as to its domestic challenges.  How likely do you think that is?  Germany has managed to transform itself in the past and I am confident that it will be able to do so today. Naturally, this requires strategic thinking and openness to change. In particular, the green transition offers Germany vast opportunities to regain its technological leadership. The economy will pick up eventually, but the main issue concerns long-term potential growth, and that depends very much on how Germany tackles its structural challenges.  Arguments that the global economy is generally entering a phase of weak growth and disinflation are gaining ground. What do you see as having the most impact on inflation looking ahead?  What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics. When input costs rose sharply, many firms raised their prices in excess of the cost increase. So we saw an increase in profits in many sectors, also due to temporary supply-demand imbalances caused by bottlenecks and reopening effects. As a result of rising prices, employees experienced a drop in real wages. Now employees are trying to regain lost purchasing power, and tight labour market conditions are making it easier for the unions to negotiate higher wage increases. It is through such second-round effects that inflation becomes more persistent. The weakening of the economy, which is partly due to monetary policy transmission, makes it harder for firms to pass through higher wage costs to prices, meaning they may need to absorb higher costs through their profit margins. We see indications that this is happening. How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation, particularly underlying inflation, will be going forward.   There is a major difference of opinion as to how corporate profit margins over the last period have spurred inflation growth, with some analyses pointing to the conclusion that they were totally irrelevant.  Inflation is not only the result of rising wages or higher energy prices. Profits have also increased quite a lot over recent years. Looking ahead, the question is by how much wages will increase and to what extent rising wage costs will be absorbed by profit margins. It is only natural to expect that the unions and employees will try to regain some of the lost purchasing power and that wages will grow. But it is crucial how firms respond, and that depends on demand conditions and hence on our monetary policy.  Fiscal policy is expected to be prudent and cautious in order to curb inflation. However, politicians have their own concerns, such as a decline in the living standards of their citizens and in investment. On account of its widening fiscal deficit, Italy is again in the spotlight, and so is an increase in its bond yields. How does one reconcile these opposing goals?  We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years, which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures. However, we have also learnt over the years that consolidation should not come at the expense of necessary public investments. What really matters is the composition of public spending, which should aim to make the economy more productive and to strengthen the supply capacity. This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term. Therefore, it would be unwise to postpone public investments and structural reforms that are necessary to transform the economy. This is where the European funds come into play. The Next Generation EU programme can help countries to continue investing in their future. At the same time, the perception that the government can counter every economic shock through fiscal transfers is dangerous and could lead to unsustainable fiscal dynamics.    When it comes to recent yield movements in global financial markets, the largest part is driven by a general repricing of longer-term rates, as markets are anticipating interest rates to be held at a high level over a longer period of time. These higher funding costs imply that governments need to be even more prudent.  The ECB’s position that the price of borrowing will remain high for as long as necessary to reach the target inflation rate has been communicated quite clearly. Nevertheless, is there anything else that can be said in that context?     Our policy is data dependent, which implies that the level and duration of restrictive rates will depend on how the data develop. What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner. That is then also embedded in inflation expectations. One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly “anchored” around our target, in spite of painfully high inflation rates. Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.\n",
      "Content 17: It’s been two weeks since the ECB raised rates for the tenth consecutive time, have you now done enough to tame inflation?  Let me stress an issue, which is sometimes slightly overlooked but is a very important part of the discussion, namely the transmission of monetary policy. That's crucial in order to understand the decisions that we have taken and those that we will take. In transmission you have two different legs. The first one is from our monetary policy decisions to financial markets and banks. In that first stage, the transmission is almost complete. You can see it. In the banking channel, there has been a tightening of financing conditions following our decisions. And there has been a significant drop in the demand for credit.  The second phase is how the impact of the tightening of financing conditions feeds through to the real economy. And here there is much more uncertainty. We have seen a slowdown in economic activity. But there are other factors behind that, for instance the impact of inflation on households’ disposable income and the evolution of exports, which is related to the slowdown in the global economy. The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy, and indirectly to inflation. That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates, if maintained over time, will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.   Do you worry about the risks of overdoing the tightening of monetary policy and driving the economy into an unnecessarily painful recession?   We do not at all want to create an unnecessarily painful recession. We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy. This is, at the end of the day, a very delicate balance. If the transmission is incomplete, then we should be a little more patient. If the transmission is much closer to completion, then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.   Does the recent rise in oil and gas prices, coupled with a weaker euro, make your task more difficult?   Yes, it makes our task more difficult. I would not say that it is a game changer. But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.   What would it take for the ECB to start cutting rates?   Well, we are not there.   But what would you need to see?   First of all, progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability, i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way. Starting to talk about rate cuts now is premature. We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Still, I think the last stretch is going to be more difficult. We are on our way towards 2 per cent. That’s clear. But we must monitor that very closely, as the last mile will not be easy.   But would the last mile be the hardest to achieve in bringing inflation down?  First let’s look at the factors in favour of disinflation. Base effects have an impact. Supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away. And there is monetary policy and the clear slowdown in the economy. In the second half of the year the economy in the euro area will have stagnated.  Now let’s turn to factors against disinflation. There’s a spike in oil prices. Wages are growing about 5 per cent on average. Demand for services is high, even though we have started to see a clear slowdown. And the euro has depreciated.  So, when you put all this in the balance, our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months. But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.   Are governments making inflation worse by continuing to run big deficits?   The first factor with respect to fiscal policy is the withdrawal of the subsidies granted over the last two years, which must be completed before the end of 2023. But it’s not only that. There is also the fiscal stance, which sometimes gets overlooked. My impression is that after four years without EU fiscal rules, governments may have got used to a little bit of a “whatever it takes” approach with respect to fiscal policy. But that has to change. Having a tightening of monetary policy and, simultaneously, an expansionary fiscal policy would be a very bad policy mix. And being more concrete, what would be detrimental is a fiscal deficit that goes above the level of 2022.   Does the ECB need to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system?   We are doing that. And this is totally normal in the process of normalisation of monetary policy. That is the correct pace, the correct path. TLTRO reached €2.1 trillion and now we are a little bit below €500 billion. And over the next year it will become close to zero.  What about stopping reinvestments in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme?  Some of my colleagues in the Governing Council have been quite outspoken with respect to the need for starting the process of quantitative tightening on the PEPP. But in the formal structure of the Council, we have not even started the discussion. It will arrive sooner or later.  Do you still need the flexibility of PEPP reinvestments as the first line of defence against financial market fragmentation, despite not having used it for two years?  If you ask the military, they will tell you that extra lines of defence are always good. Yes, we could use flexibility in the reimbursement of the PEPP to address fragmentation. It has not been used for two years because spreads are quiet. The PEPP is less than €2 trillion. Therefore, even doing a full run-off, the withdrawal of liquidity will not be huge. It is the first line of defence in times of volatility in markets, but that is not the case now. So, we’ll have to analyse it.  How about the banking system? Do you expect an increase in non-performing loans?  Return on European banks’ equity has clearly improved because of the widening of net interest margins after the increase in interest rates and it is now above 10%. Two years ago, it was around 4%. But banks’ valuations have not moved in parallel. Why? I think that the main reason is because the cost of equity of the European banks has increased quite a lot and it’s close to 15%. When interest rates increase, the cost of equity also goes up. Markets are also pricing in that the improvement in profitability will not be sustainable over time because they are factoring in an economic slowdown. And they price in that banks will have to increase provisions should non-performing loans levels go up.  This means profitability will be dented in the future. The current figures are a sort of illusion. In the pipeline, we start to see that the quality of the assets is deteriorating, and there’s an increase in non-performing loans. On top of that, taxes on bank profits have created some uncertainty.   Should countries not introduce bank taxes?   Not all bank taxes are identical. You have seen that in the case of Italy. The final proposal is much more sensible than the first one. Our point is very clear: these taxes should not impair credit and should not create any limitation in the capitalisation of European banks. This applies as well in terms of the banks being prudent in dividend payments and share buybacks, and even the remuneration of bankers.  Some members of the Governing Council would like to increase the minimum reserve requirements for the banks, on which you pay no interest. What do you think of that?  My opinion is that we should conduct monetary policy based on price stability, not on the profit and loss of national central banks. To reach price stability, you have to reduce liquidity. The reduction of liquidity will give rise to a reduction of these windfall profits that the commercial banks are getting at the moment because of increasing interest rates.   Are there any signs of distress in the property sector?   In commercial property there has been a very important decline in prices, mainly in some Nordic countries. The main problems have appeared in Sweden, Finland, the Nordic countries. But it’s quite pervasive. Residential real estate is more resilient. But, for instance, in the case of Germany, it was not a total surprise to see the recent data showing that house prices have declined by almost 10%. That’s a clear indication that there were some pockets of overvaluation that are going to be corrected. Our concern now are the non-banks, the property and mutual funds, that have a big exposure to real estate. I would say that commercial property – even though we also need to pay attention to residential property – is our main source of concern in terms of financial stability.\n",
      "Content 18: Your speech at   Terschelling   was something of a departure for a central banker, in that it was clearly very personal, while at the same time seeking to counter a certain pessimism regarding attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Are you concerned that there isn’t sufficient buy-in at the moment from, as you put it, “those who pollute, those who finance the polluters, and those who supervise the financiers of the polluters”?  Looking back at the past five years, there are many things that clearly show we are not transitioning to a zero-emission economy fast enough, with all the problems that brings economically. On the other hand, many other things are going in the right direction. My main message was that we can do this, but we need to be fast. The later the transition, the higher the cost, as our recent economy-wide climate stress test has shown. So I might have used a little more pathos than I would have done if speaking here in Frankfurt, but the message is just as clear.  Is the ECB doing enough?   As supervisors we have a multi-year strategy. We published our expectations for climate-related and environmental risks in 2020. In 2021 we asked the banks to conduct self-assessments of where they stood vis-à-vis these expectations. On the basis of what we saw a year ago, the glass is slowly filling up, but it is not yet half full and it needs to be full by the end of 2024. I do see progress – banks are now better equipped to manage climate-related and environmental risks than when we made our initial assessments. Each of our expectations has been met at least once by a bank we supervise. The glass is filling up – but it is not yet full. Building on what the banks themselves found reasonable, we set a series of interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year, the second at the end of 2023 and the last – by which banks need to satisfy all our expectations – at the end of 2024. And we have said that we will use all our instruments to enforce these deadlines if needed.  Banks understand that we mean what we say and that this is within our mandate, because climate-related and environmental risks translate into financial risks which must be managed by the banks. This is also acknowledged worldwide. Although you do still see differences in how fast and how ambitious supervisors are, the fact of these risks being within their mandate is no longer controversial. That is a real step forward, and one which also reflects the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example.  But in that speech and others you’ve highlighted the urgency that’s required. Is that compatible with what is arguably still a very gradualist approach aimed, essentially, at trying to bring banks along with you, rather than you saying “you absolutely have to do this now, and if you don’t there will be consequences”?  First of all, ask the bankers. I don’t think that they would say that this is extremely gradual – many banks probably feel that we are pursuing this rather enthusiastically. There are clear deadlines − also interim deadlines − and we will enforce them if necessary. To be very clear, that includes periodic penalty payments. That’s not a step we take lightly, so I think that this shows how serious we are when we issue supervisory expectations. Do I particularly like that? Well, I believe it’s better to convince the banks. I know we’re asking a lot, and some banks would say it’s very difficult and claim that they can’t really do anything because they lack the data. But it is also true that the risks don’t become smaller just because they are difficult to measure. There is still a lot you can do short of perfection. But the risks are out there, and they will not wait until 2030 or 2050 to materialise – so we need to make real progress. Patchy data are better than no data at all. The same is true of the emerging art of climate modelling. Patchy climate models are better than nothing, but if you don’t even identify the gaps, you cannot really make progress towards filling them. There are many other things banks can do besides climate modelling, and we have also published a guide of best practices for banks that sets out these numerous options.  So looking at it from other directions, is there anything more that the ECB could, or should, be doing beyond compliance, such as making green investment more attractive? Might we one day see the green TLTROs (targeted longer-term refinancing operations) that commentators were discussing not so long ago?  Whereas up to now we’ve been speaking about what we are doing in our banking supervision, you are now asking a question about what we might consider in our monetary policy. Talking about possible future instruments is of course highly speculative, because whenever we design an instrument, we take into consideration all the circumstances of that particular moment. Any instrument needs to be effective to pursue our primary mandate of price stability, and it needs to be proportionate. It also depends on the environment – whether we are in a period of policy tightening or accommodation. But climate considerations are clearly part of the monetary policy strategy we adopted in 2021. I think it’s fair to assume that we will take climate considerations into account in the features of any type of instrument we may design in future − including any purchase programme.  In your speech you also mentioned the extent to which national governments subsidise fossil fuel industries. Obviously, there are limits to the ECB’s mandate, and maybe this is pushing those limits. But insofar as this issue constitutes a financial stability risk, can the ECB play a greater role? Or should it be left to private citizens to pursue the issue through the courts?  You’re talking to a lawyer, and the overriding requirement through all of this is that we act within our mandate. And when I talk to banks, I point out that we are seeing exponential growth in climate-related litigation. From our perspective, banks need to manage that risk at a time when there are certain cases in which the courts have endorsed rather far-reaching legal theories, including against states. It can no longer be taken for granted that those judgments will not be repeated or set a precedent, and that is something banks should be acutely aware of.  You said recently that there will be a just transition or no transition. Could you unpack that a little?  What I wanted to say there is that, if you look at what is happening in the world, it is clear that there is a risk of a growing antagonism – that the energy transition and climate crisis become politicised. All EU Member States have committed to becoming Paris Agreement-aligned. Not delivering on that, or postponing the transition, will lead to an economically suboptimal situation where the transition ends up being more costly. Our own analysis has also shown this time and again. Bringing attention to this issue is within our mandate.  If we could turn to monetary policy – In your last Governing Council meeting, the ECB raised interest rates again. For the final time in the cycle?  We have said it very clearly: we consider that, with the decisions we’ve made and on the basis of our current assessment, the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term. Does that mean policy rates have peaked? Not necessarily. There is still a lot of uncertainty. That’s why we take these decisions meeting by meeting, on a data-dependent basis. Making any predictions about what we will do next would not be consistent with that approach.  How do you see the balance of risks to the inflation outlook? Is it simply that the latest hike puts the ECB on a sounder footing by guarding against any additional upward price pressures?  I think that’s exactly what it is. Of course, there are upward risks to inflation. There could, for example, be upward pressures on food and energy prices – since July we have been alluding in our monetary policy statement to the importance of weather and climate conditions in this respect. Climate change could also lead to a shift in longer-term inflation dynamics, but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation. Helpful distinctions have also been proposed by my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Isabel Schnabel, analysing the impact of climate change itself, the ongoing dependency on fossil fuels and the green transition. Some aspects are certainly inflationary – 2022’s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67% compared with the year before, for example, so that’s rather significant. But it could also be the case that, over much longer horizons and depending on how the transition goes, energy will become much more abundant and cheaper.  Do you see any evidence that the current interest rate environment is having a negative effect on green investment?  Any interest rate decision has an effect on investment, both green and non-green. In the end, I think the best we can do is make sure that we deliver on our price stability mandate. That will create the stable environment in which the transition – including the required investment, which needs to be sped up – can take place.  How concerned are you about the growth outlook for the euro area? Or does the primary mandate of price stability ultimately matter more?  What we’re seeing is a more protracted period of sluggish growth than we were expecting. Of course, we need to look at the various explanatory factors, such as lower demand for euro area exports, the impact of tighter financing conditions, lower residential and business investment, and the weakening services sector. On the other hand, labour markets are still strong and disposable income is expected to rise, which would have a stabilising effect on overall GDP growth. It’s also true that our primary mandate is to deliver price stability, and I think we have proven we are very determined to do that, as seen in the ten rate hikes that we’ve decided on since July 2022.  So would you consider cutting rates if growth were to surprise significantly to the downside in the coming months?  I think I’ve explained very clearly how we take our decisions. We take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and we look at all the incoming data. We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments, and we will weigh any incoming data carefully, as always, in relation to our inflation outlook.  Would you need to see inflation clearly and consistently trending below 2% over the course of your medium-term projections before considering a cut appropriate? Equally, would reinvestments need to have stopped by that time?  Let me stick to what I have just said. As you know, we stand ready to adjust all our instruments as needed. Based on today’s assessments, we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target. We will keep rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.\n",
      "Content 19: You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?  Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.  So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?  So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.  So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?  Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.  As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?  I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.  You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?  Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.  Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?  This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.\n",
      "Content 20: Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?  We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.  In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?  Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.  Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.  Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.  I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?  I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing. This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.  I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.  I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?  Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.  Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.  I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?  Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.  Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.  Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?  I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.  I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?  The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.  Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?  Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.  Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?  We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.  We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic!  For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?\n"

      "Content 1: Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.\n",
      "Content 2: In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.\n",
      "Content 3: Mr de Guindos, Germany is in a recession, the entire euro area economy has not gained momentum for a year now. How much of this is down to the ECB?  There are three reasons for the weak growth in the euro area, the first of which is inflation. It has curtailed purchasing power, causing consumption to fall. The second factor is the noticeable slowdown in global trade. And the third is indeed the ECB’s monetary policy. When we raise policy rates, businesses and households see their financing costs increase. That results in less consumer spending, less investment and subsequently weaker growth, which in turn slows down price increases. That’s how monetary policy works.  Could you quantify the extent to which you curb economic growth through higher interest rates?  That is very hard to say. Monetary policy works with a lag. We can see that banks are already charging higher interest rates and so have tightened their financing conditions. But assessing the extent to which this is already reflected in the real economy – in other words, in consumer spending and investment − is far more difficult.   Research shows that the full effect of interest rate increases is only felt after one or one and a half years. You decided on your most recent interest rate hike four months ago. So is the biggest damper on the economy still to come?   As I said, that is difficult to calculate. My personal estimate is that the  greater part of the tighter financing conditions, perhaps two thirds, has been passed through to the real economy already.   The consequences in one area, housing construction, already can’t be overlooked. In Germany, as in many other countries in the EU, fewer and fewer building applications are being submitted although housing is urgently needed. Do we simply have to accept that as collateral damage in the fight against inflation?   Within monetary policy the main tool for fighting inflation is to raise interest rates. However, we cannot set different interest rates for different economic sectors. In the real estate market, the higher interest rates also help prevent a further increase in prices, or an overheated market as was seen during the low interest rate era over the past few years. A measure of calm is a good thing in this area at least. Targeted fiscal policy should address construction and housing problems.  But fewer houses are being built because of the higher interest rates; fighting inflation is already taking its toll…  Please don’t forget that when inflation abates and wages increase in relation to prices, then people regain their purchasing power. That generates more consumer spending and an economic recovery. So by reducing inflation, we are also contributing to more growth in the future.   How do you assess the growth prospects for the euro area and Germany?   In December we projected that the euro area would grow by 0.8% this year.   That is low.   I personally think that the  prospects have even deteriorated in the meantime. Some of the risks mentioned in our projections have materialised: world trade has lost momentum, geopolitical uncertainties have increased, and our interest rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to the economy sooner than expected. So growth in the euro area could even be slightly below 0.8%. But let us wait for our next projections to be released in March.   And how do you see the prospects for Germany? The mood among many entrepreneurs, investors and employees here is quite gloomy.   In my view, the German economy is first and foremost burdened by two factors. First, the energy crisis, which was deeper in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. The second factor is that the German economy is strongly geared to manufacturing and exports, especially exports to China. As growth in China is slowing, Germany’s economy is performing worse than that of other industrial countries. But  I clearly remember being deputy finance minister in Spain in the early 2000s when Germany was considered the sick man of Europe. A few years later it was suddenly the rising star. So I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.   Do you not see any major problems in Germany?     There are structural problems with energy supply and not enough has been invested in infrastructure over the past ten years. But that can be changed. And I am sure that, if China’s future growth is not as strong as it was in the past, German firms will soon export their products to other countries. Germany is competetive and can resolve its problems.   Euro area inflation was still 2.9% in December. When will it fall to the ECB’s target of 2%?  According to our December projections, this should happen in the second half of 2025. But  inflation figures have mostly brought positive surprises recently. I think that inflation will be slightly lower than we have predicted.  Your prediction for this year is 2.7%. Does “slightly lower” mean 2.5%?  I  wouldn’t want to put a figure on it.  What’s so bad about inflation being 2.7% rather than the 2% that the ECB is targeting?  Price stability is typically defined as 2% in many advanced economies such as the United States or United Kingdom. We are also targeting an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. If inflation is significantly above that, there is a risk that people start expecting rising inflation and so demand higher wages, for example, which in turn pushes inflation higher still. This increases the risk of a wage-price spiral. Competitiveness suffers too as products become expensive in international comparison because wages have grown too much. In addition, a central bank loses credibility if it continuously fails to reach its target.  The ECB is often criticised for hiking interest rates too late. Is there a risk that it will now lower the rates too late?  I don’t think so. Also, we changed course as early as December 2021, long before our first rate hike, when we announced that we would be gradually ending our bond buying programmes. This was a first step in the normalisation of monetary policy. But even if you do assume that we were late, just look at the outcomes: within 12 months inflation has fallen from more than 10% to less than 3%, and no deep recession materialised. So far, despite the delicate situation, we have managed to keep the balance between inflation and growth, also thanks to the very good situation on the labour market. The economy did not collapse. This is very important for the prosperity of people in Europe.  But it is not all just thanks to monetary policy, is it?  Of course there are other factors at play, like steeply falling energy prices and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks. But monetary policy has played its part.  When you started hiking interest rates there were concerns, even within the ECB board, that highly indebted countries like Greece or Italy could get into trouble because high rates make new lending more expensive. That could have led to another European debt crisis like the one in 2009. Why has it stayed calm?  Banks in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are in much better shape now than they were back then. Their stability is not in doubt. And I know what I’m talking about – I experienced the European debt crisis in my role as economy minister of Spain. In addition, the countries that were in trouble have since improved their competitiveness. This is thanks to the reforms initiated at the time. I worked on those too, cooperating closely with Wolfgang Schäuble.   Schäuble, who passed away a few weeks ago, was the German minister of finance at the time.  I’m sure that Wolfgang would be very pleased with the progress Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal have made. He called for reforms aimed to fix government budgets and the banks, and strengthen competitiveness. Many of the policy recommendations he advocated have paid off. In some ways, the economic performance of Southern European countries may even be better now than that of their northern neighbours!\n",
      "Content 4: A Franco-German homage and appeal  As a young member of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble founded the Baden-Alsace discussion group together with the Mayor of Colmar, Joseph Rey. In his last ever campaign appearances, he supported pro-European parliamentary candidates in Alsace and Lorraine. Born during the war, raised in the French occupation zone, elected in the border region of southern Baden, friendship with France was close to his heart throughout his life – as the foundation for a strong Europe.  As a minister, Wolfgang Schäuble worked in close contact with his French counterparts. He was the first German finance minister to participate in a meeting of the French cabinet at the Élysée Palace. He formulated the aspiration to always take French and European interests into account: “If a solution is good for Europe, then it is good for Germany. And if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany”. German unity and European integration, open borders and joint security, a strong euro as a guarantee of stability – these fundamental convictions shaped his actions.  As President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, together with the then President of the French National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, spearheaded the establishment of the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on 25 March 2019 in Paris; this joint chamber, comprising 50 German and 50 French members of parliament, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both Presidents had previously signed the Franco-German Parliamentary Accord, which – some 56 years after the Élysée Treaty – adds a parliamentary dimension to the Franco-German friendship as an intergovernmental agreement, thus raising it to a completely new level. None of this would have been possible without Wolfgang Schäuble’s impassioned efforts alongside his colleague in Paris.  Even in his last interview – published on 24 December 2023, just two days before he passed away – Wolfgang Schäuble called for reviving the Weimar Triangle as a “German-Polish-French engine for Europe” and strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities: “Let’s follow this European path. Only by working together can Europe play an economic, military and environmental role in the world.“  That is his legacy. And that is why the state memorial ceremony in his honour is quite rightly taking place on 22 January, “Franco-German Day” – exactly 61 years after the signing of the Élysée Treaty and six years to the day since Wolfgang Schäuble became the first President of the Bundestag to address the French National Assembly on 22 January 2018. In that speech he described the Franco-German friendship as \"a gift from history\", but one owed to the vision of courageous people who, after the world wars and the crimes committed by Germany, showed the way to reconciliation. Wolfgang Schäuble said: “What has been achieved inspires us to move forward” and added “Let us use the freedom we enjoy today. Let us live up to our responsibilities as courageously as the original signatories. Together! ”  Wolfgang Schäuble more than lived up to these responsibilities, and did so honestly and tirelessly. Yet the state memorial ceremony in the German Bundestag with Emmanuel Macron is more than just a tribute to great merit. It is a mission and an appeal. It is a mission entrusted to us, as leaders in politics and society, to bring the European vision to life in a spirit of close partnership. And it is an appeal to young people to keep enthusiastically pursuing the idea of Europe. Peace, freedom and friendship cannot be taken for granted, we have to work for them again and again. As for European integration, it is far from complete and must continue to be shaped, with determination – and by those who are truly European at heart, as was Wolfgang Schäuble.  We will honour Wolfgang Schäuble's memory with immense gratitude for his life's work. We pay tribute to a great German, a great friend of France and a great European. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Wolfgang Schäuble.\n",
      "Content 5: The rate hike in September was meant to increase confidence that the ECB would achieve its inflation target, so it was like taking out extra insurance, in a way. In light of recent, more encouraging data, is that extra insurance still warranted or can it be rolled back?  The first point to make is that there has been progress on inflation in recent months. It is hard to be exact about the role of individual hikes, but of course the September interest rate hike has helped with that. By underlining that the ECB will maintain a restrictive policy, it has helped cool down inflation expectations and moderate price setting in the autumn.  Second, once the ECB begins lowering interest rates, this would not be by a single decision of a rate cut, there would most likely be a sequence of rate cuts.  The September hike means the peak rate has been higher than it otherwise would have been. I recognise that there was an insurance element in that rate hike. And I will fully take that into account in terms of the scale and timing of the rate adjustment towards a more neutral monetary policy stance when it comes to it.   What is it that the market is getting so wrong by expecting ECB rate cuts by March or April, and for these to then continue rather aggressively in 2024? Do you believe the market discounts euro area recession, due in part to a more restrictive German budget, that were not included in the more recent ECB staff projections?  The inflation release for December was broadly in line with our projections – I’m not seeing some major downside surprise. It was in line with our signal that there would be a jump. And the continued progress on the easing of core inflation is welcome. But we do see some headwinds to services inflation this year and, for the time being, wages are still growing well above any kind of long-run equilibrium rate. We don’t expect energy prices to continue falling at the same rate as last year.  Our baseline staff projections include a significant recovery in the European economy this year due to stronger demand in Europe which is, on its own terms, inflationary. But we flagged in December that there are downside risks to our forecast. And that is one of the big data questions we have for these weeks: will we see a recovery or a continuation of the kind of stagnation we had for much of 2023? We remain very data dependent.   Peak monetary policy restriction will coincide with the onset of tighter fiscal policy, especially in some of the larger euro area economies. How much are you incorporating these effects into your expectations?  Our December projections do have an assumption of fiscal tightening in 2024, in line with what was contained in the draft budgetary plans of euro area countries. The fiscal tightening is essentially due to the ending of the cost-of-living support measures, energy measures, and so on. Then, late last year, we also had the German court ruling, which has led to some revision in Germany. But I think for 2024 the scale of the revision is not large enough to lead to a significant change in the inflation outlook.   The ECB needs to assess wage settlements before getting an orientation on monetary policy in 2024. Many wage deals will happen this month and during the spring. Do you think you will have a clear enough idea by the governing council on April 11th?  I have a range of data I want to see. We do receive the data on the latest wage settlements every week. We have a wage tracker measure that we use as an early indication of the wage dynamics. We also look at market data on wages. But the most complete dataset is in the Eurostat national accounts data. The data for the first quarter will not be available until the end of April. By our June meeting, we will have those important data. But let me emphasise, we do have other data that we will be looking at every week, because, as you say, a lot happens every month and we look at all of the data available to us.  It will take time to have a good understanding of whether the wage settlements are decelerating. We expect that 2024 will still have high wage increases, and it is important for people to recover the losses from high inflation. But the scale of that will determine the timing and the scale of rate adjustment this year.  Most euro-area countries have experienced serious drops in real wages, especially Germany and Italy. What is a fair and compatible wage settlement to you: 2% to compensate for inflation, plus 2% to account for expected productivity growth? Maybe there should be some little extra-compensation, given purchasing power losses since 2020?  For the whole euro area, if inflation typically should be 2 per cent and labour productivity grows at 1 per cent, then the rate of a wage increase consistent with a 2 per cent inflation target is around 3 per cent. In 2023 we had increases of about 5 per cent and in our projections we now have wage increases coming down by maybe a percentage point in 2024, then above 3 per cent in 2025 and at around 3 per cent in 2026. So for this year and next year we still expect high levels, to compensate for the high inflation, especially in 2022. This is natural. But the adjustment of wages is a multi-year process. If countries try to do it very quickly with very large wage increases, then you could get a wage-price spiral. It’s going to be a gradual process, in the interest of everyone.  Representatives of the Italian government have been vocal a number of times that they criticised the ECB after hiking decisions. What’s your message to them?  The inflation situation is very unusual, the surge in inflation was very intense. But of course we also saw significant disinflation last year. We had very atypical factors driving inflation as, historically, monetary policy tightening was often meant to cool down an overheating economy. We did not have an overheating economy in the euro area. The inflation was primarily coming from supply shocks caused by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. But it’s very important to appreciate the role of interest rate rises, even when the origin of inflation is a supply shock. There is a risk that inflation becomes embedded. If people expect inflation to remain at a high level, then firms would try to set high prices, and workers would then have to respond by claiming higher wages. You can get into a situation where high inflation becomes embedded. If we had not hiked interest rates, we could have seen more of that original temporary supply shock converting into stagflation.   Government politicians in Italy say the government budget will depend on monetary policy. What the ECB will do will impact the cost of debt, and essentially inflation has come down. Why doesn’t the ECB cut rates at this point?  For governments, the long-term interest rate is the most important one, as they issue a lot of ten-year bonds and so on. The market is taking the view, which I share, that we have done a cyclical increase in interest rates; it’s temporary. So long as inflation is confirmed as returning to 2 per cent, it will be appropriate to normalise interest rates. And that will help to lower the costs of government debt. But to get there requires us to hold steady and make sure that the inflation problem is fully defeated. The history of high inflation episodes tells us that if central banks try to normalise too quickly, before the problem is really conquered, then we get another inflation wave, and then another wave of interest rate hikes. That would be a far worse scenario. So it’s important for us to take our time and make sure there’s enough evidence that inflation is securely returning to target. A false dawn, too rapid a recalibration, can be self-defeating. We don’t want to overtighten and keep rates too high for too long. But, equally, it is important not to prematurely move away from the hold-steady position that we have been in since September. What moves us from holding steady into active normalisation will be an important discussion. But it’s too early, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to move to the next stage.  Italy has not ratified the ESM Treaty reform. How does that fit the completion of the Banking Union?   We think it’s very important that the Treaty is ratified and exactly for the reason you mentioned. Europe faces many challenges. There needs to be a lot of investment in Europe to fund the green transition, improve productivity, improve dynamism. We now have Next Generation EU, which will help for the next couple of years, especially in Italy. But when we look ahead, we need the banking system to fund a lot of investment. In turn, for that to happen, we do need to make progress on banking union. And for the ESM to be a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, we need the Treaty to be ratified.   There is some pressure from the US for Europe to step up efforts to seize Russian official reserves to pay for Ukrainian support and reconstruction. Do you see it as a viable course of action? There are risks, aren't there?  Of course, this decision is for political leaders of the major advanced economies. From a central banking perspective, it’s important that this decision fully takes into account the implications for the international monetary system, for financial stability and the legal foundations of the international system. From our point of view, it’s important that all of these risk factors are fully assessed as part of that decision-making process.  Do you worry that if governments seize euro-denominated reserves, the status of the euro as an international reserve currency might be questioned in some other quarters, maybe in the emerging world, as other countries that might have concerns that one day their reserves in euros might be seized as well?  That requires a full analysis. So I’m sure all the different policy teams looking at this will be examining these questions closely, but it’s important to take these risks seriously as part of that decision process.  EU governments have agreed on a new fiscal framework and maybe it’s slightly more complex than the Commission was hoping for. What do you make of the final result?   A fiscal framework has to be based on a consensual agreement among EU governments, and the compromise reflects that. The kernel of the framework still has many of the elements that the Commission proposed. The new framework includes numerical guardrails, but the guardrails only kick in under various sub-scenarios. Under the baseline scenario the Commission proposal will be the baseline guidance for fiscal policy, which takes into account, very importantly, the multi-year approaches to fiscal adjustment and the role of reforms which can play out over multi-year horizons. So I think it’s a fiscal framework that can be operational.  Aren’t the safeguards going to make the rules too restrictive?  We do need a framework to help governments bring down debt ratios over time. It’s important to acknowledge that this is an objective. But everyone, I think, has learned that this has to be done carefully in a way that is sustainable.  Could the Red Sea crisis, and possible new attacks on oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz following the Western bombing of Houthi positions, trigger economic repercussions in Europe and globally?  It’s very important that the world has secure shipping routes and steps are taken to make that route safe and secure again. If this turned out to be a longer-term problem and world trade had to be redirected, that would be a new type of unwelcome bottleneck. But, even in that scenario, different effects are possible. Mechanically, higher shipping rates would add to the costs of industry. But you also potentially have a disinflationary effect, which would be unwelcome, in which many businesses around the world may just simply cancel orders and postpone investments. The result would be a more pronounced slowdown in the economy. But, also more generally, geopolitical risks may result in firms and households becoming less confident in the future.\n",
      "Content 6: Hi all, this is @Isabel_Schnabel, Executive Board member at the ECB. I look forward to answering your questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please join our conversation! #AskECB   Who decided that 2% inflation is good and what are the negatives for deflation? When was it tested? In what countries? In what timeframe?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB decided in its 2021 strategy review that a 2% target is best suited to maintain price stability. It provides a safety margin against deflation risks and eases the constraint from the zero lower bound on interest rates: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op279~016b279f2e.en.pdf?8f9fbedf46f0b7ecf0ac42473109e11a #AskECB   On August 2022, you wrote: \"central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s\". Yet, we have seen how inflation has decreased while unemployment stood at historical lows. How do you reconcile your sentence with the observed facts? #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Before the pandemic, research pointed to a flattening of the Phillips curve and a higher sacrifice ratio. New evidence suggests that the curve may have steepened, pointing to the possibility of a “soft landing”. See: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230831~c25314a3fc.en.html #AskECB      #AskECB With the TPI, the ECB now decides the political landscape in the EU, making populist spending and election possible, since the \"normal mechanism\" of spread increase does not happen. When did the ECB's remit move into deciding who should be in power, and why populists?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The TPI can only be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics posing a threat to monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Eligibility requires that countries pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. #AskECB      #AskECB There is a large group of \"austrian\" or \"hard-money\" economists and citizens completely unrepresented at the ECB leadership. Are you concerned about the lack of representation and lack of diversity of thought at the ECB board?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB leadership is selected on the basis of competence. Diversity of thought is important. The current Board and Governing Council display a broad range of experiences and expertise, which are instrumental in fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB     Why do you think Governments with their own sovereign currency and the ability to print money with key strokes, would ever consider borrowing and paying interest? And don’t you dare tell me that selling bonds is for revenue, we are all wise to that ol’ Myth.     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: A large majority of countries have independent central banks, meaning governments cannot simply “print money”. This is why governments indeed borrow and pay interest if they want to spend more than their revenues. #AskECB    #AskECB   the Eurozone unemployment rate decreased in November. How does this fit to the expectation that wage growth will slow this year?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The drop in unemployment to a historical low confirms continued strong resilience in labour markets, which is broadly in line with the December 2023 staff projections. As inflation falls, we continue to expect a gradual decline in wage growth in 2024. #AskECB   Do you expect that with the compromise on the new fiscal rules, a very restrictive fiscal policy will again make life difficult for monetary policy? What do you think of the idea of Germany incorporating the numerical targets of the EU fiscal rules into the debt brake?     #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The new fiscal rules are a step in the right direction. They are less procyclical, use a differentiated approach across member states and acknowledge the importance of public investment. However, the new framework lacks a central fiscal capacity. #AskECB    #AskECB   Récent central bank pivot triggered a substantial rates rally at the same time where Eurozone survey data are pointing to recovery. Does that concern you about inflation reacceleration or does the link between Growth/Inflation (and rates?) has softened? Thank you    @Isabel_Schnabel: There is evidence that sentiment indicators are bottoming out, but the near-term economic outlook remains weak in line with our projections. At the same time, financial conditions have loosened more than projected, while energy prices have been weaker. #AskECB   Do you think the Bitcoin ist better as the Euro CBDC? If not, why?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The digital euro is public money issued directly by the European Central Bank. Bitcoin is different – it is a speculative asset that does not fulfil the characteristics of money. #AskECB   ECB policymakers have tried to push back on market's bets, but their attempt was rather unsuccessful given the current pricing of rate cuts for March/April. What do you think the ECB needs to do to improve its credibility in the eyes of the markets?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Markets understand well that our policy is data-dependent and we have clearly defined the elements of our reaction function. I do not see a lack of credibility, but there can be different views on future economic developments and the inflation outlook. #AskECB   Inflation has been moderating whether it be headline, core or underlying. At which point could the ECB start lowering its guard? What do you think of geopolitical risks in the Red Sea on inflation in the euro area?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our projections foresee inflation reaching our 2% target in 2025. So we are on the right track. Geopolitical tensions are one of the upside risks to inflation as they could drive up energy prices or freight costs. That’s why we need to remain vigilant. #AskECB   What is the ECB's main reason not to already cut rates in the current recessionary context in Europe?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has eased but underlying price pressures remain elevated. Policy rates need to be sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation sustainably returns to 2%. A slowing economy is part of monetary policy transmission. #AskECB   Wie finden Sie es, dass Notenbanken Staatsanleihen kaufen und in ihrer Bilanz halten?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Purchases of government bonds can be a useful monetary policy tool to achieve price stability when policy rates are close to their effective lower bound, or to protect monetary policy transmission. In March 2023 we started reducing our bond holdings. #AskECB  @Isabel_Schnabel: Anleihekäufe können ein nützliches geldpolitisches Instrument sein, um Preisstabilität zu sichern, wenn die Zinsen nahe ihrer Untergrenze sind, oder um die geldpolitische Transmission zu schützen. Seit März 2023 reduzieren wir unsere Anleihebestände. #AskECB   Warum wurde der Anteil von Mietkosten und Nebenkosten im Warenkorb reduziert obwohl die Kosten steigen? Why was the proportion of rental costs and additional costs in the shopping cart reduced even though the costs are increasing?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The weights of items in the HICP consumption basket are determined by the proportion of average household spending. Weights are adjusted at the beginning of each year. This is the responsibility of Eurostat, together with national authorities. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Die Gewichte im HVPI-Warenkorb werden über den Anteil an den durchschnittlichen Haushaltsausgaben bestimmt. Sie werden zu Jahresbeginn durch Eurostat gemeinsam mit den nationalen Behörden angepasst. #AskECB  When will the ECB start buying bitcoin for its balance sheet?    @Isabel_Schnabel: The ECB is very unlikely to ever buy Bitcoin. #AskECB    #AskECB   What are overall indicators ECB is looking at to confirm a cut this year ? Also Powell has mentioned that falling inflation raises the likehold of a restrictive policy, will ECB also start loosening policy before 2%??    @Isabel_Schnabel: Crucial indicators for the outlook of underlying inflation are the developments of wages, profits and productivity. Due to the expected easing of monetary policy, financial conditions have loosened rather than tightened recently. #AskECB   Dazu: Warum darf die Notenbank Staatsanleihen explizit nicht direkt kaufen, aber dafür nach ein paar Tagen in Absprache mit den Großbanken als Zwischenstation. Inwiefern ist das etwas anderes?   @Isabel_Schnabel: As confirmed by the ECJ, the ECB may buy government bonds on the secondary market unless this is equivalent to a direct purchase. If banks could resell bonds to the ECB with certainty, this would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Laut EuGH darf die EZB Staatsanleihen auf dem Sekundärmarkt kaufen, sofern dies nicht äquivalent zum direkten Kauf ist. Könnten Banken Anleihen mit Sicherheit an die EZB weiterverkaufen, verstieße dies gegen das Verbot der monetären Staatsfinanzierung. #AskECB  Welchen Vorteil bringt CBDC gegenüber dem aktuellen digital Geld was ich hin und her schicke, WIRKLICH!?!?!?    @Isabel_Schnabel: A central bank digital currency provides public money – like cash – but in digital form. The ability to exchange private money – like bank deposits – into public money at any time strengthens trust in the currency. More here https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.en.html #AskECB   @Isabel_Schnabel: Digitales Zentralbankgeld ist öffentliches Geld, wie Bargeld, aber in digitaler Form. Die Möglichkeit, privates Geld wie Bankeinlagen jederzeit in öffentliches Geld umzutauschen, stärkt das Vertrauen in unsere Währung. Mehr hier https://ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/why-we-need-it/html/index.de.html #AskECB  Do you really not get it that inflation is only a function of money supply growth in the long run? Or do you know but ignore it because it would harm your career?    @Isabel_Schnabel: Just recently I gave a speech on the relationship between money and inflation. Have a look! It’s not as simple as you suggest: https://ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230925_1~7ad8ef22e2.en.html #AskECB    #AskECB   Looks like many ECB economists duplicate less paid and equally competent NCB staff, with limited value added and higher complexity. Do you have the right people and institutional layout to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems while making good use of eu money?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The Eurosystem is organised in a way that avoids duplication by a division of labour. Centralised decision-making with decentralised implementation is an efficient way of fulfilling our mandate. #AskECB   Do you admit that price stability means most of the time (f.e. 2010-2020) fighting prices going down? What are opportunity costs and unintended consequences of your mandate of price stability?   #AskECB      @Isabel_Schnabel: Price shocks were predominantly disinflationary before the pandemic and inflationary after the pandemic. Shocks related to climate change or a decline in globalisation could imply a higher prevalence of inflationary shocks in the future. #AskECB   What does it say about Fiat that - according to the ECB - it needs to be enforced as legal tender to be considered money?     @Isabel_Schnabel: Fiat money is not backed by commodities like silver or gold. Its value stems from people accepting it. This is fostered by a credible central bank and the legal tender status, which means people are in principle obliged to accept it at face value. #AskECB   Are there IT jobs available at the ECB   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Yes, we are frequently looking for IT experts. Check out our vacancies here: https://talent.ecb.europa.eu/careers. #AskECB   my question: As part of a serious, long-term risk strategy for the ECB (as with every central bank in the world), wouldn't it be advisable to hold small Bitcoin reserves alongside gold reserves?   @Isabel_Schnabel: The objectives for the management of the ECB’s foreign reserves are liquidity, security and returns. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that does not meet our criteria for foreign reserves. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/tasks/reserves/html/index.en.html #AskECB   I have 2 questions. BLS showed throughout 2023 that bank lending was (very) weak. What do you expect for 2024? Continued weakness or (subdued) recovery? Is it a sign for you of monetary policy transmission?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: In 2023 credit standards tightened significantly and loan growth fell sharply. This shows that our monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Loan growth is expected to gradually recover as of 2024. #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel   In your opinion, what is the neutral rate of interest for the Eurozone going forward, once the 2% target has been reached?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of the neutral rate are inherently uncertain. The need for higher private and public investments due to the green transition as well as digitalisation and geopolitical shifts may lead to the neutral rate being higher than before the pandemic. #AskECB    #AskECB   Does having a single price stability mandate (unlike dual mandates like Fed’s price and employment ) make ECB reaction function overtly hawkish?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our reaction function is determined by our single mandate of price stability. Our inflation target is symmetric and our medium-term perspective allows us to also tackle supply shocks without unnecessarily causing unemployment. #AskECB   Where do you see r* currently and what implications do you see it having for the monetary policy calibration?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Estimates of r* are subject to very large confidence bands. Therefore, they provide limited guidance for monetary policy in real time. So we also need to look at incoming data to see how restrictive our policy is. #AskECB    #AskECB   The ECB projects more years of above-average inflation after the already large peak, at the same time the ECB is not rising rates now further to counter-act inflation after the lag effect. Why not act now to reduce future projected above-average inflation?   @Isabel_Schnabel: According to our projections, inflation will approach 2% in 2025. Our monetary policy works with a lag. If we raised rates too strongly, this could lead to an undershooting of medium-term inflation and an unnecessarily strong slowdown of the economy. #AskECB    #AskECB   When can we expect the review of the ECB's operational framework to be finalized?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We aim to conclude our operational framework review this spring. #AskECB    #AskECB   ¿why do you buy government's debt? That makes you less independent and lets government's reach levels of debt that should not be possible creating crisis and/or inflation.   @Isabel_Schnabel: Government bond purchases are a tool to protect policy transmission, or to stimulate demand when our policy rates reach their effective lower bound and inflation is below target. Side effects like fiscal dominance or moral hazard need to be monitored. #AskECB   The market is pricing cuts in 2024 pretty aggressively. Yet the ECB forecasts predict core inflation above 2% for the entire year. At which level inflation would have to either realize or be forecasted at, for the ECB to start cutting this year. Thank you   @Isabel_Schnabel: It is too early to discuss rate cuts. We will keep our key policy rates at restrictive levels until we are confident that inflation sustainably returns to our 2% target. This requires additional data confirming the disinflationary process. #AskECB   How have the recent shocks (the pandemic / energy crisis) affected the neutral rate in the eurozone - have they increased it from the pre-pandemic period?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The increase in real yields after the pandemic may partly reflect changes in the short-term natural rate of interest. But the post-pandemic economic environment has also complicated the measurement of that rate. #AskECB   How much of the money in Eurozone is public money in how much private money?    #askECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Most of the money in the euro area is private money, such as bank deposits. Currently, public money is only available in the form of cash. Of about €10 trillion in readily available money (M1), banknotes constitute some 15%. #AskECB   pls take my question in advance then, vry simple/straightfwd: Why does the   @ecb   insist on pushing the EZ into recession if all headline and core measures on shorter 3m and 6m annualized windows already indicate inflation BELOW 2%????   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Our mandate is to preserve price stability. For that we need to see inflation returning sustainably to our 2% target. We expect inflation to reach 2% in 2025 and project that we can achieve this without causing a deep or prolonged recession. #AskECB   What’s is your view on   @EmmanuelMacron   proposal regarding different rates for “greener” purposes? Is it even realistically possible? Pros&Cons?   @Isabel_Schnabel: We should intensify efforts to green our lending operations, including the collateral framework. First steps are already being taken. Green targeted lending operations could be considered when monetary policy needs to become expansionary again. #AskECB   Is CBDC going to be used to force citizens to make certain choices they don't feel will benefit them?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Not at all. A digital euro would offer an additional payment option for everyone in the euro area, backed by the ECB and usable all over the euro area. Just like cash, it would be simple to use and meet the highest privacy standards. #AskECB   Hello, i would like to ask how the ECB intends to preserve the €'s buying power, considering the energy rising costs and deteriorating manufacturing whose decline seems to be unabated. Ty for your time and i apologize in advance if im too vague. Am just a simpl man   @Isabel_Schnabel: Inflation has come down significantly due to a reversal of previous shocks and our policy tightening. But monetary policy will not undo the rise in the overall price level as this would require plunging the economy into a deep and long recession. #AskECB    #AskECB   Considering the diversity of economies within the eurozone, how would the ECB ensure that measures effectively reach all member states, addressing potential concerns about uneven transmission of the policy effects?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Our monetary policy has been transmitted to all parts of the euro area. But due to institutional features, such as fixed vs variable rate loans, transmission will not be the same. Economic convergence and financial integration foster even transmission. #AskECB   How is it the ECB, exactly like the EU, wields so much power for NOT be elected by ANYONE?   @Isabel_Schnabel: Elected governments decided that central bank independence is the best way to ensure price stability. The ECB must always act within its mandate and is accountable to the European Parliament. More here: https://ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html #AskECB   Does the ECB take into account the asymmetries that are produced from its policies due to the fact that the EZ is not a proper monetary union? Do you think it should/shouldn't? Thank you   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: Further steps in European integration would clearly benefit our single monetary policy. Therefore we need to make further progress towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union. #AskECB    @ecb   Why would any Country give up their sovereign currency knowing that money can be printed instead of borrowed ? The US,UK,Can... have retained their sovereignty, they are in a better situation to react to \"shocks\" in the economy. natural or man made.   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: The euro area countries have decided to give up their own currencies and join the euro. A currency union reduces transaction costs and facilitates trade by removing exchange rate risks. The euro enjoys wide support in all member countries. #AskECB   Also, how far can BVB go in the Champions League this season?   #AskECB    @Isabel_Schnabel: All the way! #AskECB  Time to wrap up for today. Many thanks for your questions – I really enjoyed our chat! Take care, @Isabel_Schnabel #AskECB\n",
      "Content 7: When I think of Wolfgang Schäuble, the first image I see is him sitting across from me at the table of the French cabinet in the Élysée Palace, the first German finance minister to participate in such a meeting. I see him sitting at the negotiating table in Brussels, at one of our many meetings that ran long into the night. I hear the straight talker who never shied away from difficult decisions. I remember the dedicated public servant, a master of diplomacy with the intellectual ability to understand opposing viewpoints. I see a natural statesman with the courage to stand by his convictions as well as the pragmatism to recognise the world as it is. And I see a man of loyalty and kindness.  The recent passing of my dear friend and colleague saddens me deeply, and my heart goes out to his family. Yet I take comfort in remembering his remarkable achievements for Europe. I recall his own words in this regard because they capture his clear commitment to both Germany and Europe: “If a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.” Few have done as much for Germany and Europe over such a long period as Wolfgang, with his more than half a century of public service. As minister of the interior, he was at the heart of Germany’s reunification process. It was a moment of profound change for the country and for all Europeans, and one that had to be handled with great care in view of the sensitivities of neighbouring countries to German history. Wolfgang understood that one of the best ways for Germany to demonstrate its responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours. That was no small matter in a nation so proud of the Deutsche Mark. But he knew that a single currency would bind Europe together and protect the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations, and that this was in Germany’s and in Europe’s best interests. When Europe’s sovereign debt crisis came, Wolfgang was a calming influence, reminding us that the euro is much more than just a currency. His defence of Europe was unwavering and absolute. Nevertheless, he was always self-reflective, and later asked himself how things could have been done differently, potentially causing less suffering. Wolfgang’s intellectual rigour stemmed from his ability to combine the subtlety of a diplomat with the attention to detail of a lawyer. It was a quality that put him at the forefront of discussions in the 1990s on how to build a more deeply integrated European framework.  His statesmanship would have been welcome in today’s challenging environment of extreme views. His success did not come through a forceful personality, but from understanding how to find common ground with others. This approach has served Germany and Europe well. In my experience, Wolfgang’s philosophy was consistent: stay true to yourself and to your democratic institutions. Now is a timely moment to remember that as we remember him. I will miss my dear friend, and the birthday flowers he sent me over many years!\n",
      "Content 8: Inflation has recently fallen to 2.4%, more rapidly than expected. Are you satisfied?    We will only be satisfied if inflation falls sustainably to 2%. We currently foresee that inflation may pick up again temporarily in the near term, as base effects in energy prices reverse and government support measures expire, such as in Germany the gas price cap and the reduction in VAT on catering services. We expect that inflation will then gradually drop to 2% by 2025.  So, we still have some way to go and we will see how difficult the famous last mile will be.   But you do want to go the last mile?  We must go the last mile: we have an inflation target of 2%.   Would 2.1% not be enough?  We want to return to 2% on a sustainable basis.   There is war in Ukraine and Gaza. How much do global crises influence the central bank’s work?   Geopolitical shocks lead to uncertainty and thereby affect economic decisions. At the same time, they can also push up energy prices and hit world trade by disrupting supply chains – which we see happening in the Red Sea right now. Geopolitics can also influence the green transition, if the supply of commodities, such as those required for producing solar cells or batteries, is restricted for political ends. All of this affects our core business: the fight against inflation.   Your policy rate decisions are data-dependent, as you always emphasise. How useful are historical data to you when, as at present, the global situation is constantly changing fundamentally?  Historical data are valuable as one can derive patterns from them. But the world can change very quickly. We then need to adjust our analyses, without discarding historical knowledge. The macroeconomic environment has indeed changed radically over the past few years. We came out of a long phase of low inflation and then – owing to the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine – quickly entered a completely new world of soaring inflation. Looking at the period of low interest rates would hardly help. But by analysing the great inflation of the 1970s we can draw lessons on how we should react today.   Inflation was very low in the past decades. Was that mainly because of the central banks’ sound monetary policy? Or was it partly luck, thanks to globalisation for example?   It was both. After the great inflation of the 1970s, monetary policy changed fundamentally. Central banks have become more independent and have a clearer mandate: price stability. This has increased the credibility of monetary policy. But there have also been macroeconomic trends, particularly globalisation and China’s entry into the world market, which played an important role and brought down inflation.  Has the fight for stable prices got tougher?   Since 2020 there have been several severe external shocks. That makes monetary policy more challenging.   Will inflation be higher in future than it was before?   Let me first assure you that we do not have any intention of adjusting our inflation target of 2%. At the same time, we may be confronted with more supply-side shocks. And these could turn out to be inflationary, even though that is hard to predict. Climate change, for example, drives prices, we see that already. Extreme weather can push up food prices, low water levels in the Panama Canal increase transportation costs, and carbon taxes raise the price of fossil fuels. A partial withdrawal from global supply chains can push up inflation as well. But there are also opposing effects such as the advance of artificial intelligence, which could boost productivity growth and thereby temper inflation.   When you joined the Executive Board in 2020 you wanted to smooth the fractious relationship between Germans and the ECB. Did you manage to do so?   The determined fight against inflation probably helped Germans reconcile somewhat with the ECB. It has enabled us to strengthen the ECB’s credibility.   But the ECB was too slow in combating inflation. Many people haven’t forgotten that.     We acted relatively late, but all the more decisively. We sharply increased interest rates within a short time, and there is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to the fall in inflation. Inflation was initially caused by rising energy prices and disrupted supply chains owing to the pandemic and the war. These constrained aggregate supply, while demand remained robust. Determined monetary policy is essential in such a situation to dampen demand and anchor inflation expectations. We succeeded in doing that. It is important for people to know that the central bank will bring inflation back to its target of 2%.   Inflation has fallen, but the higher prices continue to put pressure on people.  The prices are clearly higher than before the pandemic, and monetary policy cannot roll back that increase. And people would not be better off if we plunged the economy into years of deep recession just to bring the prices back to their old levels.  Would you manage, though?  With massive consequences, but this is not the task of monetary policy. An energy price shock makes an economy that is reliant on energy imports poorer overall. Somebody has to bear those losses.  When you have achieved your 2% inflation target, is there a risk of forgetting that the high level of prices is as good as entrenched now?  We target inflation, not the price level. Also in the past, it was never our goal to balance out inflation rates that were too low with higher inflation in the future.  The quick and sharp interest rate hikes have led to banks suddenly making record profits. Is this fair?  Our decisions are guided by our price stability mandate. But they have side effects, including their impact on bank profits. Banks have lent money at higher rates, but they have not passed the higher interest rates on to their depositors immediately or in full. But we expect banks’ profits to be under more pressure in the future because banks will face higher funding costs and rising credit default risks, while lending is weakening. Banks would therefore be well-advised to use these short-term profits to build up a buffer against future losses.  But banks tend not to do that, opting to pay out dividends instead. Erring on the side of caution would certainly not hurt the banks.  The high profits are also boosted by the 4% deposit facility rate which banks receive on their excess reserves. The ECB could shrink these deposits by raising the minimum reserve requirement. Why has it not done so?  In July we decided to no longer remunerate the minimum reserves while keeping the minimum reserve requirement at 1% of the minimum reserve base, which consists mainly of customer deposits. The minimum reserve requirement is not an effective way of compensating the remuneration of excess liquidity. Large banks have the highest excess liquidity, smaller banks have less. At the same time, the smaller banks are mostly funded by deposits. This is why they would be disproportionally affected by higher minimum reserve requirements.  By the same token, large banks are subsidised with the deposit rate, because many smaller lenders only have low excess amounts that are remunerated.  Banks are not subsidised. But the effects of our measures do vary. For example, during the pandemic the ECB granted longer-term loans that have strongly benefited smaller banks. At the same time, until recently banks were charged a negative interest for their excess liquidity, and that affected large banks more. There are no banks that are systematically at an advantage or a disadvantage. All banks are important for the transmission of monetary policy.  The ECB could sell all the sovereign bonds – that would solve the excess reserve problem. The ECB’s balance sheet has already shrunk significantly. This will continue in the coming years, thereby reducing excess liquidity. But the primary monetary policy instrument is ECB policy rates. The reduction of our balance sheet is happening gradually in the background, also to avoid market turbulence. While we are not expecting any, we are not taking any risks.  The ECB is making losses now because it has to pay high interest to banks while holding low-yielding bonds. A central bank that is making losses doesn’t look too good.  Our bond purchases were always guided by monetary policy considerations. Take the pandemic emergency purchase programme. This measure probably averted a serious financial crisis that would have wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s lives. The ECB’s losses cannot be viewed out of context.  But they do damage your reputation.  We always assess whether our measures are proportionate, and losses can damage the central bank’s credibility and independence. In the future, this might lead to a certain reassessment of bond purchases.  How do you assess the ECB’s bond purchases?  Bond purchases can be employed for achieving two distinct goals: price stability on the one hand, and market stabilisation on the other. They were very successful in stabilising the financial markets. But we could ask ourselves how effective bond purchases were in combating low inflation. At the time, one problem was the very restrictive fiscal policy. Governments failed to make use of the low interest rate period to invest, and this made life difficult for monetary policy.  The lesson here is that fiscal and monetary policy need to pull together.  When you joined the ECB in 2020, inflation was low, the key interest rate below zero and central banks were making profits. This has all changed. How has it affected you?  I have learnt that the world can change much more quickly than you think. The central bank needs to react swiftly in such situations, and this is a challenge. But I think that we have done pretty well in the past four years.\n",
      "Content 9: Wage cost data in Spain point to an increase of 4.7%. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that domestic inflation is resisting and is largely predicated by wages. Do you think wage moderation is required to beat inflation?  A year ago inflation was above 10% and now it is below 3%. Indicators of underlying inflation are also favourable, i.e. there is a clear downturn in inflation, basically because the supply and energy components that were having a negative impact have started to fade, and because monetary policy is taking effect. However, average wage growth in the euro area is over 5%, whereas productivity is barely improving. This means that unit labour costs are rising, which adds to inflationary pressures. In 2022 profit margins increased considerably, but this year the increase has been more moderate. This is partly due to firms absorbing some of the increase in labour costs, which in turn is contributing to moderate inflation growth.   What will the ECB do in this situation?  We will analyse developments in wage costs and profit margins, as both factors could delay the return of inflation to our 2% target. We are keeping a very close eye on this.  The EU is emerging from this crisis better than it did in 2008. What do you think has changed?  We have the experience of what happened in 2008 and the two crises are completely different. The 2008 crisis broke out on the back of extremely high private sector debt levels, which had a significant impact on the banking sector. The response was also very different. For the crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic, there have been no limits to fiscal policy, and this has been accompanied by monetary policy that has also been very expansive. In addition to this, the European Union came up with an action plan for all countries throughout the bloc, providing them with funding through the Next Generation EU programme.  However, the situation has now changed. Almost all income indicators have returned to their pre-pandemic levels and the focus is now on fighting inflation. To this end, the ECB takes action through its monetary policy but we also need to see fiscal policy return to normal.   With euro area inflation at 2.4% in November and euro area GDP stagnating for the past twelve months, how do you explain to people why interest rates are being kept so high?   Interest rates are doing what they are supposed to do, which is bring inflation down. Monetary policy operates by tightening financing conditions: higher interest rates affect levels of economic activity. And when economic activity is dampened, inflation slows. Once we see inflation is clearly converging in a stable manner to our target of 2%, monetary policy might then start to ease. But it’s still too early for that to happen.   When can we expect to see the first interest rate cuts?   If sustained for a sufficiently long period of time, current interest rates will help bring inflation down to 2%. We are data dependent. The data have been favourable but still not enough for us to change our monetary policy. It’s therefore too early to talk about a cut in interest rates.  What do you think about opinions from certain quarters that the ECB is sort of following in the slipstream of the US Federal Reserve?  The US economy’s fundamentals and cycles differ from Europe’s. US fiscal policy has been much more expansive, growth is higher and the rate of unemployment, below 4%, is even lower than in the euro area. With an unemployment rate of 6.5%, our labour market is in good shape, but on the whole the economies are in different situations. As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, what the Federal Reserve does is relevant, but it does not determine the ECB’s monetary decisions.  Do you think that now is the time for completing banking union? This debate always seems to be ongoing but never seems to reach a conclusion.  Completing the banking union is essential if we want full economic and monetary union in Europe. There is one pillar missing: a European deposit insurance scheme. European elections will be held in June 2024, offering another opportunity for this. Completing banking union should be on the future European Commission’s agenda, as should making progress on a fiscal union through the introduction of a common fiscal stabilisation function.  Do you think there is the risk of a recession if, for example, the war in Ukraine drags on?   The ECB does not expect a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But beyond whether or not a recession will occur, the main issue is that Europe’s economy has a structural growth problem. Both our projections and those of the European Commission see very moderate growth of around 1% up until 2026. These potential growth levels are low because productivity is barely improving. Europe needs to import more energy than other global economies. As a result, the energy crisis further exacerbates its competitiveness issues. Structural reforms are therefore necessary. The aim of monetary policy is to reduce inflation, but to achieve growth, other factors must be brought into play.  What would these reforms have to be?  One would be completing banking union, as I mentioned. Clear progress also needs to be made towards the capital markets union, and also in the single market of the European Union. Not much is said about the latter, but we are in a situation where there are hardly any limits on state aid, which creates imbalances between countries, depending on their fiscal position. The focus basically needs to be on Europe's low growth potential, how to increase productivity and the reforms needed to boost growth in the medium term.  Do you think it would be feasible to standardise the formula for the European Union’s Next Generation funds?  The Next Generation funds were a response to the pandemic and had two very positive aspects: the issuance of joint debt and the fact that part of the aid consisted of grants rather than loans. Beyond the clearly positive effects of the programme, it ultimately highlights that we need to complete our economic and monetary union. And to do so it is vital to have a permanent centralised fiscal policy instrument, and to implement structural reforms.  Staying with the European Union, there was an agreement on fiscal rules yesterday. How does the ECB see it?   Markets are calm and interest rates on sovereign debt have even fallen. But this can change relatively quickly in the context of low growth, tight monetary policy and geopolitical risks. That is why it is very important to have a clear framework of common fiscal rules. We welcome that there's an agreement because that reduces uncertainty in the markets.  And what is the ECB calling for?  Our recommendation is that the framework should be simple, transparent, easy to understand and countercyclical. In other words, it should allow fiscal policy to be expansionary in bad times and contractionary in good times. Fiscal action plans need to ensure a prudent and sustained reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in structural deficits. They should also create fiscal space for public investment in digitalisation, climate change or defence, and should provide incentives for structural reforms.  In the end, would you say that the EU has completely ditched austerity?  Sometimes it is not clear what is meant by “austerity”. Fiscal sustainability is essential, and, at the same time, fiscal rules have to allow for countercyclical action. And to be able to increase the public deficit during an economic downturn, countries need to rebuild their fiscal positions and reduce their public deficit when the going is good. Beyond fiscal policy, one basic difference between the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis was the very different monetary policy response, providing liquidity to banks and launching a pandemic asset purchase programme that has ultimately provided immense support to the European economy.  Do you think southern European countries have learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis?  Banking systems are much healthier than they were in the period from 2008 to 2011. And that is a key change. Moreover, these countries have made efforts to become more competitive and have a balance of payments surplus. For example, Greece and Portugal have made very significant budgetary adjustments that have been reflected in the risk premia and the ratings agencies. Many southern European countries have made considerable efforts to improve the sustainability of their public finances in the medium term. That is why it makes no sense to now try to create some kind of north-south divide between EU countries.   One of the most important projects the ECB is currently working on is a digital euro. How is it going and what are its key components?  At the moment, we all have euro banknotes in our wallets. A digital euro would be exactly the same, just on our mobiles. It would basically be the banknotes we have now, but in digital form and also backed by the central bank. We want it to be an additional, alternative means of payment. It is not meant to replace banknotes but to complement them. There would also be a limit on the amount of digital euro you can hold. In other words, it would be a means of payment but not a means of saving. We want a digital euro to be more comparable to banknotes than current accounts.  Do you share the Government’s optimism about the Spanish economy?  The Spanish economy has a healthy banking system, which is completely different to how the situation was in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the economy is competitive, with a surplus in the balance of payments. It is important that both are maintained in the future. The external sector, including international tourism, has helped a lot in restoring income to pre-pandemic levels.   Are there any challenges?  Education still needs some work. This affects medium- and long-term growth because there are mismatches between labour supply and demand. The 12% unemployment rate means there is room for improvement in the labour market. Like some other euro area countries, Spain has a high public debt-to-GDP ratio of 110%. It is therefore important that these countries implement a prudent adjustment programme to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP.  All countries are going to face major challenges: economic slowdown, geopolitical risks, a new framework of fiscal rules or higher interest rates. That is why economic policy must be predictable.  The last two questions have a Spanish context. What do you think about Nadia Calviño’s appointment as the next president of the European Investment Bank?   Naturally, as a Spaniard, I think it is positive that Spaniards hold key positions in the European Union. I wish her and the institution all the very best.   And in the same vein, particularly seeing as you have held the post that Calviño now leaves, who would you like to see occupy the position left vacant by her?  It is not my place to comment on domestic affairs. I am sure whoever is appointed will be competent and I wish them every success.\n",
      "Content 10: What is your take on the unexpectedly benign November inflation reading? Does the recent string of downside surprises change your view about the inflation trajectory?  “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” I’m sure you know this famous quote that is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. Over the past year headline inflation has declined rapidly. This was due to the reversal of the previous supply side shocks and was mainly driven by energy and food prices. Base effects played a significant role. The November flash release was a very pleasant surprise. Most importantly, underlying inflation, which has proven more stubborn, is now also falling more quickly than we had expected. This is quite remarkable. All in all, inflation developments have been encouraging. That said, despite these positive developments, I still believe that we must not declare victory over inflation prematurely. We continue to expect an uptick over the coming months. There’s going to be a reversal of some fiscal measures and of some base effects, and we cannot exclude that there’s going to be a new price spike in energy or food. Our job is now to make sure that the disinflationary process continues and that we remain on track towards the 2% target. Our monetary policy is working. The restrictive policy is contributing to dampening growth in aggregate demand. Economic growth has been weak over the past several quarters, and it’s expected to remain weak this quarter before gradually picking up next year. This period of below-potential growth is needed to bring inflation back to 2%. So, I believe we are on track, but we need to remain vigilant.  Are we still on the inflation path you outlined in your September projections?  Let’s see what our December staff projections are going to show. But the recent inflation print has given me more confidence that we will be able to come back to 2% no later than 2025. This is our main objective.  What is your assessment of growth since the September projections?   Some of the hard data we see are not very good. But some of the soft data are giving us hope. The purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) seem to be bottoming out and they’re even showing a small uptick. Of course, this is from very low levels. But it is in line with our projections. Growth is then expected to pick up gradually next year, mainly due to rising real incomes, which should foster confidence and consumption. All this will depend, to a large extent, on the development of the labour market, which has been very resilient. We have seen that firms have held on to their labour force in spite of weakening economic growth. This is only sustainable if they expect growth to pick up. If there was a significant deterioration in the labour market, this could put the growth recovery into question and at the same time accelerate the disinflationary process. But while we do see some softening in the labour market, we do not expect a significant deterioration or a deep and prolonged recession.  Do you see a risk that the rapid drop in credit demand could exacerbate the downturn?  What we’re seeing is that monetary policy transmission is working. There has been a sharp increase in lending rates and a strong slowdown in loan growth. This is exactly what we wanted to see.  Markets are pricing an early spring rate cut but the ECB has guided for steady rates for several quarters. How do you view this discrepancy?  Markets are confident that inflation is going to come down rapidly and therefore they are pricing early and very large rate cuts next year. Central banks are more cautious, and I would argue they have to be more cautious. After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution. If you look at our previous communication after the Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that our key policy rates need to remain sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to bring inflation back to our 2% target in a sustainable manner. This should happen no later than 2025.  According to our staff projections, the current level of restriction is sufficient to bring inflation back to target within that time frame. Transmission is working – lending growth is slowing, the economy is weakening and inflationary pressures are easing. We are right on track. But we still need to see some further progress with regard to underlying inflation. The disinflationary process on underlying inflation has only recently gained momentum. We now need to see whether this is sustained. We’ve seen very strong wage growth and weak or even falling productivity, leading to a sharp increase in the growth of unit labour costs. This is why we look very closely at services inflation in particular, which gives us a good indication of whether this disinflationary process is sustained. We’re going to watch upcoming wage agreements very closely. This will certainly also matter for our monetary policy decisions.  If the current level of restriction is sufficient, does that mean you do not see a need for further rate increases?  The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.  What is sufficiently long? Do you also see several quarters of steady rates?  We need to see more data. There’s first likely going to be an uptick in inflation. So, this downward movement of inflation is probably not going to continue for now. And most importantly, we need to see what’s going to happen to underlying inflation, to wage growth, to productivity, to unit profits. In order to be confident that we will sustainably return to our target, we need more time.  Am I reading it correctly that you’re not ruling out a rate cut before mid-year then?  We remain data dependent. That’s the main thing. We have to see what’s going to happen. We have been surprised many times in both directions. So, we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months’ time.   What is your view on the timeframe for ending pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) reinvestments?  As President Lagarde mentioned, the Governing Council is going to discuss reinvestments under the PEPP in the not-too-distant future and I’ll leave it up to you to interpret what that means. It’s clear that discussion is going to come. It’s also clear that at some point we’re going to fully end PEPP reinvestments. The amounts involved are relatively small and markets are expecting this to happen, so I think it’s not such a big deal.  Am I correctly reading the mood that even if reinvestments end, there is no appetite for outright sales of bonds in either the asset purchase programme (APP) or PEPP portfolios?  We have never discussed outright sales.  You gave a speech in March in which you made the case for a demand-driven system for the ECB’s new operational framework. How has you thinking evolved since?  What I said in that speech is that a demand-driven system is well-suited for a heterogeneous currency union that may be prone to fragmentation. Such a system also likely limits the size of the central bank balance sheet. Of course, it can be designed in many different ways. What we are doing in our framework review is trying to find a system that implements our monetary policy effectively and efficiently in a way that minimises the negative side effects. So, the new system has to take into account the specificities of the euro area financial system. It has to be firmly embedded in our legal framework and it should limit our market footprint. But one should be aware that we are starting from a situation of abundant excess liquidity. So whatever framework we choose, money market rates will initially remain close to the floor.  What is the timeline for the balance sheet to shrink to its optimal size?   That depends on various factors that we can’t project perfectly. It also depends on the framework that we will eventually choose. One of the main drivers of the size of the central bank balance sheet is the growth of what we call autonomous factors – banknotes and official sector deposits – and the growth of reserve requirements. These factors already imply that the balance sheet is going to be around three times as large as before the global financial crisis.  In addition, banks could have a higher demand for excess liquidity for regulatory or precautionary reasons. If the outcome of the review was a demand-driven system, the size of the balance sheet would thus also depend on banks’ demand for excess liquidity. This would mean the size would not be determined by us, which is a good thing, because we don’t know precisely what the demand is.  The Federal Reserve has gone with the floor system. Could two of the world’s biggest central banks operate with different frameworks?  I do not see any problem with that. If you look around the world, you see many different frameworks.  The Fed has a supply-driven floor, the Bank of England a demand-driven floor, and Sveriges Riksbank a narrow corridor, while many central banks in emerging markets have a classical corridor. So, there is a wide variety of models out there that are tailor-made for specific financial systems.    Do you see the need for a structural portfolio of bonds and/or longer-term bank loans? What would the size of such a portfolio need to be?    I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of the framework review. There are different ways to provide liquidity to the financial system and all of them are going to be discussed in the review. We are going to weigh up the benefits and costs of each of them, and it could make sense to have a mix of different tools. We need to keep in mind, though, that this only matters far out in the future, because we are starting from a situation where we have a huge monetary policy bond portfolio. The structure of the balance sheet only becomes relevant when it has to grow again. As regards a structural portfolio, I mentioned in my March speech that this could be considered. Also keep in mind that we de facto already have a structural portfolio because some national central banks are holding bonds in their Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) portfolios.  What do you mean by “far out in the future”? Could it be next decade?  That depends on the decisions we are going to take. If we decided on both longer-term credit operations and a structural portfolio, we would have to think about a potential split. But this really depends on many factors and I do not want to make any predictions. What is clear is that the balance sheet has to be much larger than it was before the global financial crisis. But, for all the frameworks under consideration, the balance sheet is going to be much smaller than it is now.  Should the ECB introduce new longer-term refinancing operations?  We will discuss the different options available to provide liquidity to the banks, including longer-term operations. But such a facility would have to be different from the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) we were offering during the pandemic, in that it would have to be offered at market rates. From the banks’ perspective, longer-term lending operations are attractive because they provide a certain reliability of funding. And they reach all parts of the banking sector directly. That is very different from asset purchases – when you inject liquidity, it typically ends up with the larger banks and in certain financial centres.  Do you see a case for increasing the minimum reserve requirements, as some of your colleagues advocate?  We had a discussion on minimum reserve requirements in July and we discussed both the calibration and the remuneration. We decided to keep the minimum reserve requirements at 1% but to remunerate them at zero, instead of at the deposit facility rate. The reason for this was proportionality. With this change, we can implement our monetary policy stance in the same way and equally effectively while paying lower interest to the banks. That was the justification for reducing the remuneration. The proportionality argument implies that, if we have two options and one of them leads to losses while the other is just as effective in achieving price stability but reduces these losses, then we should choose the option that generates smaller losses. But let me stress that the minimum reserve requirements are not a tool for adjusting our monetary policy stance. They also have distributional effects – they have the greatest impact on the banks with the highest deposit base, which tend to be the smaller banks. We are going to discuss the role of minimum reserve requirements in the operational framework review. And until then, we will not take any decisions.  To what extent should profit and loss considerations matter for monetary policy decisions?  Our monetary policy decisions are determined by our mandate. Profit and loss considerations matter only insofar as they affect our credibility and, consequently, our ability to pursue our mandate.  Andrea Enria argued recently that shadow banks need closer scrutiny, and the ECB could theoretically conduct this supervision. If the ECB supervised them, it could also provide them with access to liquidity facilities. Is that needed?  The experience of the pandemic shows that we are able to distribute liquidity across the financial sector without giving non-banks direct access to our balance sheet. At the moment we are not considering opening up our balance sheet to non-banks because there is no clear case for that.\n",
      "Content 11: Please note that the interview was conducted in English and translated into Dutch and French. In case of discrepancies between the versions, the English version prevails.   What would you say to those who think that banks are making excessive profits?   The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, which has just been published, indeed shows that bank profitability has risen sharply. This improvement can be attributed to the widening of interest rate margins. The return on equity of euro area banks now stands at around 10%, whereas in 2019, barely five years ago, it stood at 4%. So it has clearly improved.  Still, this is something of an illusion − it is after all a short-term improvement. In the long term, we expect profitability to fall again. Why? There are several factors. First, the economy is slowing, which will lead to higher default rates and a decline in asset quality. Second, banks will have to pay more to attract deposits. On term accounts, for example, interest rates have already risen sharply. Likewise, the bonds that banks issue themselves will need to carry a higher return. So overall the cost of bank funding is on the rise. And finally, an often-overlooked factor is that demand for credit is falling. Putting all that together, you can see that high bank profitability is not sustainable. In fact, the financial markets are already convinced of this, as bank share valuations are in no way reflecting expectations of high profits.  Are the banks sufficiently covered for interest rate risks. If not, could the regulator, the ECB, review its requirements?   The interest rate risk of European banks can’t be compared to that run by some US banks such as Silicon Valley Bank with a different business model. The repricing of loans, in other words, raising interest rates in line with the market rate, has been much faster than the repricing of deposits in Europe. However, the interest rates on deposits will also increase at some point.  So is interest rate risk adequately covered?  Yes, but at the same time banks will be facing a loss of profitability as I said. I am talking about the average for the sector.   There has been a lot of debate about interest rates on savings. Politicians are taking initiatives to get banks to raise interest rates. Is that a good idea?  If the ECB raises interest rates, it is for borrowers and savers. Lending rates have risen and the remuneration of deposits is expected to follow suit. The remuneration on savings accounts should reflect our interest rates. That is part of our monetary policy transmission. Because if savings become more attractive, consumers will spend less, reducing demand. This is what we aim for to push down inflation. However, we now see banks are delaying passing on higher interest rates to savers. They can do that because they still benefit from abundant liquidity right now. But we are also taking measures to reduce excess liquidity, so that higher interest rates on savings accounts will become a reality – sooner or later.  Do you see differences between member states in this respect?  Yes, there are differences. In some countries, banks are quick to adjust interest rates on deposits, and in others, such as Spain, they are lagging behind. Euro area banking sectors also differ in the way mortgage loans are granted, whether it is at variable or fixed rates. Strengthening of profitability was particularly notable for banks in countries where variable-rate lending predominates and the pass-through of higher policy rates to deposits has been slower.  And Belgium?  I know the Spanish situation because it’s my own country, but we look at euro area averages and developments as a whole.  Some economists criticise the system that allows banks to make money easily by depositing their excess liquidity with the ECB. This is resulting in generous profits at the moment because interest rates are rising. What’s your take on this?  The ECB has raised its interest rates with a view to these increases being passed on to all remuneration categories in bank balance sheets. The level of liquidity in the market was extremely high and had to be reduced. This reduction is under way now and will go hand-in-hand with a decline in these types of revenues for banks.  You have also changed the remuneration of the minimum reserve requirement for banks. Some bankers believe that this should be raised to ensure a stronger capital base. Do you think that’s a good idea?  We have indeed set the remuneration of banks’ minimum reserves to 0%. The levels of those reserves have so far not been changed or discussed. I know some central bank governors are in favour of increasing them. We have limited the remuneration on the minimum reserve requirement, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of banks’ liabilities. I understand that remuneration of reserves is important for some banks, but monetary policy shouldn’t be driven by the financial position of banks or the profits of the central banks. Our objective is to bring inflation back to our target.  National central banks are going to have to report significant losses owing to the policy of quantitative easing, which led to huge purchases of sovereign bonds to inject liquidity into the market. Do these losses pose a problem?  It’s true that central banks are currently reporting losses owing to the hike in interest rates, but if we look at a longer period of time, for instance over the last 10 years, the net outcome is positive in terms of central bank profits.  What about the real estate market? People are complaining about the higher cost of loans. What would you say to them?   What is happening is part of our monetary policy. The sharp rise in interest rates is starting to dampen real estate prices. This is more apparent in some countries than others, but a moderation in price trends can be seen everywhere. On average, house prices are stabilising. The decline in commercial property prices is much more pronounced.   Does the situation pose a danger?   It could affect banks, but fortunately they are less exposed to commercial real estate than they are to residential real estate. Commercial real estate is more often financed through other channels, such as mutual funds. But in the financial system there is a high degree of interconnectedness, so we look at the overall picture.  Huge investments are needed to make homes and other buildings climate-proof. Are the higher interest rates delaying funding for investments aimed at combating climate change? Could that slow down the climate transition?  It’s true that substantial investments are needed, but I think they should mainly be financed through subsidies and European funds like the Next Generation EU. This is a matter for fiscal policy. That doesn’t alter the fact that the ECB conducts monetary policy by increasing or decreasing rates without discriminating between sectors or borrowers.   Monetary policy also affects the climate transition in other ways. Some investments are being jeopardised by higher financing costs. This has already resulted in plans for various wind farms being scrapped.  The ECB pays close attention to climate policy, but for us it’s a secondary objective. It’s national governments that play the leading role in climate policy, through taxes and subsidies. We can contribute though – and we do. For example, we prioritise climate-friendly companies in our corporate bond portfolio. This is a small contribution, but it sends a clear signal in the fight against climate change.  The ECB is preparing to introduce a digital euro. Why is that necessary?  We currently have a physical euro in our wallets, whereas the world we live in is becoming increasingly digital. There is a very natural evolution taking place from a physical to a digital euro backed by the central bank. We see the digital euro as a means of payment. We would be able to use this form of public money to pay for our shopping, our bill in a restaurant or all sorts of purchases. Like banknotes, the digital euro will not have to be remunerated. There will be a limit on the amount of digital euro people can hold, to avoid endangering the stability of the banking system. This means that the digital euro won’t compete with current accounts. That is a very clear message we want to send to the banking sector. The digital euro will not be an investment product but a simple means of payment to complement banknotes.  Won’t implementing the digital euro be very expensive for the ECB?  This will be part of our calculations during the preparation phase over the next two years, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted but, in my view, the benefits will outweigh the costs. It will offer another alternative means of payment to those living in the euro area. It will also enable us to take another step towards European strategic autonomy. And at the end of the preparation phase the decision will be taken by the European Commission, the European Council of the European Union and European Parliament.  A number of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, are struggling with how inflation is measured. The way it’s measured means actual inflation is sometimes overestimated and sometimes underestimated. Isn't that a problem for the ECB, as it’s tasked with fighting inflation?  Indeed, changes in the methodology of how energy prices are measured temporarily affects how the inflation rate is calculated. But that's a matter for Eurostat, not the ECB, and changes aim at improving the accuracy of inflation measurement going forward. Statistical changes to the compilation of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) occur from time to time. A discussion on methodological changes also applies to whether we include house prices in the inflation rate or not. As you know, that was one of the conclusions of our monetary policy strategic review. We work and share information with Eurostat on that topic, with a view to enhancing the HICP. But not on the measurement of energy prices, which is a statistical choice to how the country’s price index is compiled.  Europe is planning to use the profits from frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear to help rebuild Ukraine. The ECB is critical of this. Can you explain why?  Let me first clarify that the ECB is in favour of helping and supporting Ukraine in any way possible. But our position on utilising the dividends and interest from the frozen assets is clear. First: this should be a global decision, ideally involving all members of the G7. In addition, we have to be careful because this could lead to reputational damage. We have to look beyond this conflict in isolation, and there could be implications for the euro as a safe currency. The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation. I think there are other ways to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.  In Belgium, the launch of the ethical bank NewB has proved very difficult. Are barriers to setting up new banks in the eurozone too high?  Without entering into the details of any particular case, there are different procedures to be followed and criteria to be met, but there are no limitations beyond the legal and capital requirements imposed for the creation of a new retail bank.  But there haven’t been very many new banks in the last few years...  Because there are a lot of banks in the euro area! The real question to ask is about banks’ traditional business model. New sources of revenue need to be found, the number of branches has to be reduced. I suppose that investors are turning away from banks because the level of profitability doesn’t meet their expectations. I think there needs to be further cross-border consolidation.  So are there too many banks?  Given the cost structure of European banks, consolidation could help provide a solution. Above all else, I think cross-border consolidation in the euro area under a single supervisor and within the framework of a single monetary policy would be positive.\n",
      "Content 12: The ECB did not change its key interest rates at its October meeting, interrupting the series of ten consecutive interest rate increases that had brought rates up by 4.5 percentage points since July 2022. A few days later Eurostat announced that euro area headline inflation had fallen to 2.9% in October. Does this mean that interest rate hikes are over?  It means we are maintaining interest rates at their current level, and we believe that this will substantially contribute to bringing inflation back down to the 2% level we define as price stability.  The evolution of inflation has been positive overall: it was above 10% only one year ago and it has now fallen to 2.9%. At the same time, core inflation has also been moderating. But we have to be prudent and cautious, as there are some risks around the outlook for inflation over the next few months. We will continue taking a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions.   Euro area GDP was down by 0.1% in the third quarter, and economists think inflation may rise again over the coming months as the positive base effect will progressively fade out. At the same time, there is a risk of another commodity price shock arising from the situation in the Middle East. If the ECB finds itself at a crossroads, will it prioritise growth or inflation?  Our primary task is to maintain price stability and to bring inflation back down to 2%. Unlike some other central banks, the ECB does not have a dual mandate.  At the same time, we need to look at other economic variables that may affect inflation. We expect that growth will stagnate in the second half of the year and that the fourth quarter will not differ much from the third. Our most recent projections indicated some downside risks to growth; some of these risks have now started to materialise and this will have an impact on inflation.  Our September projections foresee that euro area inflation will reach our target in 2025, with some fluctuations caused by base effects. However, we believe that, if interest rates are maintained at their current levels, inflation will continue to fall and converge towards our target.   The ECB will publish new forecasts in December. Will these be more or less the same as in September, or are you expecting upward revisions for inflation and downward revisions for growth?   It might be premature to say it, but leading indicators point to the growth outlook being somewhat more negative than we previously projected. As regards inflation, the evolution may not be very different from what we projected in September.  You mentioned the meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach to decision-making. But in October the ECB said it considers its key interest rates to be at levels that will make a substantial contribution to lowering inflation, provided they are maintained at those levels for a sufficiently long duration. What is meant by “sufficiently long”?  This means a period of time that takes into account the potential lags of monetary policy. Recent data on headline inflation figures have been quite positive, and we are glad to see that underlying inflation is coming down, as one of our main concerns in the past was how sticky core inflation was. I would not define “sufficiently long” as used in our monetary policy statement as a concrete period of time. We will need to determine this on the basis of data. In our decision-making we will also have to take into account the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical risks related to the conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine.  But what kind of data would the ECB need to see to start reducing interest rates rather than simply keeping them at restrictive levels?  We are not there yet. We will see how things evolve month by month, but our approach now is to keep interest rates at this level long enough to reach our target. Any discussion about lowering interest rates is clearly premature.  To what extent did the ECB’s monetary policy take into account not just the euro area average but the situation in individual Member States, as there are significant differences among them, also in their level of inflation. According to Eurostat, in October Slovakia recorded the highest inflation rate of 7.8%, Slovenia registered 6.6%, while the Netherlands and Belgium recorded deflation of 1% and 1.7% respectively.  We have seen disparities among euro area countries in their economic and financial structures, in the weight of services in their economies and not least in their proximity to the conflict in Ukraine.      There are always differences in inflation and growth, but the ECB sets monetary policy for all euro area countries. Our measure of price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.  In dealing with the disparities, it is important to consider the effects of fiscal policies. With regard to base effects, we have to look at how governments have introduced, and have started to withdraw, support measures to mitigate the shocks of the energy crisis. Fiscal policy will be the key element in bridging the gap in inflation rates across countries. But our monetary policy is single.  The ECB is now looking more closely, in line with other central banks, at core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. What are ECB’s main concerns in this regard? ECB President Christine Lagarde said this summer that profit margins contributed almost two-thirds to domestic inflation last year. Almost nobody mentions this anymore, but there is now a discussion about the effects of wage increases.   It is essential to focus on core inflation, for which there are several risks. First, there may be another energy shock that would eventually affect both headline and core inflation. Second, there is the evolution of the euro exchange rate, which we do not target but which nonetheless plays a role in inflation. And finally, there are unit labour costs. Rising labour costs result from two factors. The first one is wage developments, with wage growth in the euro area now at just over 5%. The second is productivity, which is very low and has been declining because employment growth has been outpacing output growth.  It is true that profit margins grew even faster than unit labour costs last year. This year, however, we are seeing a moderation in profit margins, while labour costs are on the rise.  Our expectation is that part of the increase in labour costs will be absorbed via profit margins, meaning that not all of this increase will be passed through to final prices.   At the ECB, you are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to deepen your understanding of inflation. What will you do differently from what you have been doing so far and what do you hope to achieve? We know that, while not the only one, you have been wrong as far as the inflation forecast is concerned.   Our colleagues working with statistics deal with a lot of information, a lot of data on the financial system and the real economy, so any instrument that helps us manage this monumental amount of information is very useful.  So we are continually looking for algorithms that can give us a better understanding of what is happening in the economy, in the financial system, and a way of factoring in all the underlying tendencies that are embedded in the data we analyse.   There have been warnings that in its fight against inflation the ECB has been focusing only on the demand side of the economy, while supply-side factors also contribute to inflation. Is a more balanced approach warranted for the future, bearing in mind the pressures that may stem from geopolitical tensions, the demographic picture and the implications of the Green Deal? The economy has already been disrupted, is monetary policy next?  Sometimes it is important to stress that monetary policy works through interest rate increases, through the transmission of monetary policy decisions to financing conditions and then through the impact of financing conditions on aggregate demand.  So, monetary policy and the transmission of its decisions aim to influence aggregate demand, consumption and investment. Monetary policy cannot deal with supply-side issues. These need to be addressed through structural policies and fiscal policies.  Let me add that it’s not only the origin of inflation that’s important, but also the possibility of second-round effects, which can make the situation much more complicated, with a possible price-wage-profit spiral. In particular, we need to avoid de-anchoring inflation expectations, as this could lead to unnecessary additional tightening of our monetary policy stance.  It was announced a while ago that the ECB, in cooperation with Eurostat, would include housing costs in the calculation of inflation. How far along is this project?  This was part of the ECB’s strategy review, and it was clear that housing costs need to be taken into account when measuring inflation. However, such costs need to be well calibrated in the index, and this is mainly Eurostat’s responsibility. Including the cost of owner-occupied housing in the measurement – known as the owner-occupied property cost – contributes to the calibration of inflation. We are very willing to cooperate with Eurostat and provide our input and insights.   So there is no deadline?  It is not up to us. But there is a need for harmonised action at EU level, not just in the euro area, and this takes time.   The ECB has dealt with record-high euro area inflation by raising interest rates at a record pace. In the banking systems of several countries, including Slovenia, borrowers have felt the effects of this policy much more than savers. Is this also due to the consolidation of the banking market and the subsequent lack of competition?   You are right about the effects. As you know, we have made it crystal clear: whenever we raise our key interest rates, this increase should be passed on to all sides of the market.  The current situation can be explained by several factors. First, there is excess liquidity, so banks haven’t been under pressure to raise the remuneration of deposits. However, liquidity conditions are becoming less and less comfortable for European banks – there have been changes to the parameters for long-term liquidity lending to banks under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and changes to our bond-buying programmes, so the decline in liquidity will continue. Second, banks are always slower to change their pricing policy for deposits than they are for loans.  But there is a slow-but-steady increase in the remuneration of deposits, particularly time deposits. We believe that this process will continue. We are monitoring it very closely and, I’ll say it again, when we raise interest rates, we are not only raising them for borrowers, but for savers too, because otherwise the transmission of monetary policy would be incomplete.   Given that deposit interest rates lagging behind lending rates has resulted in considerable growth in banks’ net interest income, could you say that banks are pursuing short-term goals instead of long-term sustainable business goals, especially as you said yourself that the ECB is now determined to reduce excess liquidity in the system?  You’re right – the profitability of European banks has improved recently owing to the increase in key interest rates and an improvement in profit margins.  However, this has not been reflected in the market valuation of banks because markets believe that this improvement in profitability may not be sustainable over time. First, because the economy is slowing, which could lead to an increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Second, because the drop in demand for loans would reduce banks’ revenues. And third, because the cost of funding for banks is rising.  So I think that it’s quite obvious that, despite the improved profitability of banks, there are doubts about how sustainable this will be in the longer term.   What are the challenges to financial stability in the euro area now that we are in a phase of economic slowdown? What is the situation regarding insolvency proceedings, non-performing loans and risks to the banking system stemming from the real estate market? In Germany, residential property prices fell by around 10% in the second quarter. Do you expect a correction elsewhere as a consequence of the ECB’s monetary policy tightening?  When interest rates go up, the financial stability situation changes. The first factor we have to look at is valuations of financial assets and real estate assets. One of the main risks we see in terms of financial stability in the euro area is the possibility of a disorderly adjustment of asset prices and the implications it could have for banks. It should be stressed that banks are in a good position in terms of profitability, capital and liquidity. But we cannot be complacent because, as I said, there are some doubts about how sustainable this improvement is going to be over time.  There is another factor for financial stability. We look very carefully at non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly real estate mutual funds. In this regard, we have seen a significant drop in commercial real estate valuations. This decline had set in before the start of the monetary policy tightening but has now accelerated following the rise in interest rates. A number of non-bank financial intermediaries have seen very steep declines, particularly in commercial real estate.  In addition to economic cooling, we are also witnessing a housing crisis across the EU. How do you respond to the criticism that the ECB’s monetary policy has contributed to this, first with bond purchases that lowered bond yields, which led institutional investors to turn to the property market for returns, and now by increasing borrowing costs, which has caused many building projects to be postponed or completely abandoned?  We can be criticised for being too lenient or for being too tough. But, if I may say, I don’t think it’s fair to be criticised for both things at the same time. There were reasons why we had a very expansionary monetary policy – think back to the pandemic and the decline in GDP. I think that without our monetary policy, the situation would have been much worse. Going back even further, to the era of quantitative easing, you will recall that our monetary policy averted a deflationary crisis. However, sometime after 2021 inflationary pressures started to emerge, and we had to respond.  Monetary policy has to deal with the evolution of inflation and our primary focus has always been on price stability. Sometimes there are lateral effects. But there are also other policies to deal with a potential real estate bubble, such as fiscal and macroprudential policies.   In other words, you are looking at developments in the real estate market through the prism of the financial stability of the banking system.  For sure. My point is that monetary policy has to be focused on price stability. However, there are other instruments available, like fiscal and other policies. In the event of real estate market growth that is not fully aligned with fundamentals, macroprudential policies can be applied, bank capital buffers can be increased and borrower-based measures can be used to limit excessive growth in real estate lending. A range of policies are available.   What are the latest trends in the credit situation in the euro area?  The evolution is quite clear: financing conditions have tightened as a result of our monetary policy decisions, resulting in a decline in credit demand, which can be seen for both households and firms. This is how monetary policy works.   My last question is on the tax issue. Banks are reporting high profits, largely due to higher net interest income. As a result, several governments have decided to levy additional taxes on them. Why is the ECB not in favour?  Our decision is based on two pillars. The first is that this kind of tax should not impair lending or the transmission of monetary policy measures to the system. The second is that such a tax should not damage the solvency of banks, as this could have medium-term consequences for banks that are not well capitalised.  We have already issued opinions for Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and now Slovenia. The taxes are not all the same, but each opinion points out that the tax should not impair lending and should not damage the solvency of banks.\n",
      "Content 13: When you were in Athens last week, you talked about Greece’s resilience and its phenomenal recovery capacity. Could you tell me how this happened? How did Greece become a success story?  When I look at the key performance indicators for assessing Greece’s economic and financial situation, I see improvements across the board: in employment, growth, the fiscal situation and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Greece has completed many of the reforms on its to-do list. Not all of them, of course. There is still more work to be done. I understand that there are more reforms in the pipeline but, overall, the results of the country’s efforts are impressive. And this did not go unnoticed by those whose job it is to rate an economy and assess its credit rating – as shown by the two recent decisions that raised Greece’s rating to investment grade. I think it’s a tremendous testament to the country’s efforts. The turnaround was thanks to the fiscal adjustments and the reforms that were implemented, but also to the resolute efforts of the Greek people and the Greek authorities.  Is the high debt-to-GDP ratio of any concern to you?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is around 160% at the moment. It has fallen significantly in the last couple of years. And obviously this downward trend needs to continue in the future. I know there is more to come, but Greece has evidently responded to this challenge with determination, and the results are already clear to see.  Did you ever get really worried about Grexit? Did you think that it was possible?  There were two particular moments where the threat could have materialised. The first was during the French G20 presidency in November 2011, when there was talk of a possible referendum, which didn’t happen in the end. The second, when the threat was much more tangible and much more worrying, was in July 2015. So, we had two Grexit threats, but the one in 2015 was the most concrete, and if it hadn’t been for the determination of a few European leaders, it would have happened.  You had a front-row seat to the Greek financial crisis from a very early stage. When you look back, do you think that any mistakes were made?  The original mistake was for the country to have found itself in that situation. If there had been greater fiscal discipline and if the prudent principle of establishing a rainy-day fund for bad times when the economy was doing well had been applied, the crisis might not have happened. The fiscal policies in place before and after the crisis hit in 2009 were the original mistakes. As I have said before, it would have been helpful for the IMF to have had longer programmes than those available in its arsenal. The programmes it had were intended for rapid and deep changes, reforms and fiscal consolidation. At the time they weren’t necessarily the best tools for a country that was in a monetary union without a fiscal union or for Greece’s specific fiscal situation.  Did you learn any lessons or draw any conclusions of your own from the crisis?  One very pertinent lesson is to make sure that we have the collective discipline to address the lack of a fiscal union. I think this should be a very pressing concern for all of us. When you have a monetary union without a fiscal union, as we do, you need clear fiscal guardrails and a fiscal framework within which countries can design and implement their fiscal policies and be accountable to the other members of the monetary union. Something else that stands out from the Greek situation is that decisions were made but then sometimes reversed by the subsequent political team. And, even when decisions were taken, the implementation and monitoring needed to move forward didn’t always happen. Another lesson is that, even when banks are not the cause of a crisis, a solid and robust financial sector with well-capitalised banks is crucial.  Are you satisfied with the current state of the Greek banking system?  I think a lot of work has been done to consolidate and strengthen the Greek banking sector. Take non-performing loans, for example. In 2016 almost 50% of loans were non-performing. Now it is just over 8%. That is a significant sign of improvement, which has involved parking those non-performing loans outside the banks. So, in a way, the banking system has been sanitised. Capital ratios are much stronger, non-performing loans have gone down and liquidity ratios are also quite solid. So yes, a lot has been done to make Greek banks more robust and more attractive.  I think the fact that a large foreign bank is taking an interest in a Greek bank is a clear indication that the sector has become more attractive.  Do you think 10 or 12 years ago it would have been possible for you and the Governor of the Bank of Greece Yannis Stournaras to take a walk around Syntagma Square where all the demonstrations were happening? What was going through your mind when you actually did it this time?  I was totally bemused by the transformation, I have to tell you. As you know, I did not come to Greece at the height of the crisis, but I was obviously in frequent contact with the team. I was following the IMF mission’s visits very closely – special security measures were taken and it was a source of anxiety and concern. Now, to walk down the street, say hello to people and feel their energy, vitality and optimism was quite striking. It is a testament to the effort and the determination of the Greeks to turn things around and to take hold of their destiny with the discipline and seriousness required in a union like the EU. I think it’s fantastic that Greece can set standards and be an example of what to do, of what reforms to implement.  Do you have the sense that economic events are driven by geopolitics these days? How hard is it to carry out fiscal and, more importantly, monetary policy?  You and I have been around for a little while. And I think that geopolitics taking precedence over many other developments is nothing new. What I think is slightly different now is that there is a compounded effect of multiple geopolitical developments taking place in various corners of the world. Sometimes they are a reflection of a major schism happening in front of us. When the world had a bipolar power structure, when it was fairly organised and settled, you could anticipate things. You could have more certainty about future developments. Now it’s far more fragmented. Crises are taking place in various parts of the globe at the same time, and it’s not clear who is on whose side and what the next development will be, let alone the final outcome of the current crisis in the Middle East. And if you add to that the crisis that we have just gone through with the pandemic, plus the terribly serious challenge of climate change, which is a tragedy that is already unfolding, that’s a lot of geopolitical and climate-related developments taking place together. That’s what’s making it even harder at the moment, which is why I think that we are confronted with shifts and breaks that, although not unimaginable, certainly fly in the face of the traditional way of thinking or the certainties that we used to have.  Do you think that inflation will recede next year?  This is certainly our forecast and this is certainly our goal. We are determined to bring inflation down to 2%. According to our projections we will get there in 2025.  It seems as though increases in food prices and housing are almost becoming structural now. Are you worried about the political implications of all this, about the political pressures stemming from the rise in the cost of living?  When we measure inflation, we pay attention to the headline rate, which is what our compatriots in Europe are experiencing – how much more they have to pay to put petrol in their car, food on the table, or to have clothes, shelter and everything else. But we also try to understand what is underneath the most variable components. One of those components is food. Is the price of food going to be higher in the future? That’s a possibility if you look at the impact of climate change, for example. Droughts, floods, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will most likely have an impact on food prices going forward .  As for the political implications that you asked me about, let me say that our mandate is to ensure price stability, and this is the best contribution we can make to social peace and to society, to the most vulnerable of its members in particular.  The last question I’d like to ask you is what really keeps you up at night?  I try to sleep as much as I can, and at the moment it’s not a lot, I have to say. When I go to bed, I’m really tired and I fall asleep. But what preoccupies me before I go to bed is the level of violence, hatred and hubris around, which is first and foremost terrible for people – terrible for children and terrible for civilians. And of course, in addition to the human suffering, all this will have an impact on our economies, on the level of people’s confidence, and it will probably make our job a little bit harder going forward.\n",
      "Content 14: Why did it take the ECB so long to raise interest rates? The Federal Reserve started several months earlier.  First, in 2021 demand was playing a much bigger role in driving US inflation, so the role for monetary policy was immediate. Second, the ECB did not cut interest rates during the pandemic, as the Fed and BoE have done. So the first rate increases by other central banks were reversing the pandemic cuts. We did do a lot of QE (large-scale asset puchases, Ed.) and then the targeted lending. So our first job in December 2021 was to roll back QE and in July 2022 we raised rates for the first time. Now, would increasing rates a little earlier, say in March, have meant that inflation would have been visibly lower in 2022? I don’t think so. But the path to an interest rate of 4% would have been more gradual. But moving three months earlier is not something that materially would alter the trajectory of inflation. And there is a fairly good understanding that the source of the inflation was primarily the energy shock, as is also visible in our surveys of consumers. Our job as central bank is to make sure it comes back to target in a timely manner.  What should the ECB do if energy prices rise again – raise rates even higher and risk a deep recession?  This is definitely one reason why we hiked rates in September. When rates are restrictive then the ability of firms to pass on those energy price increases into consumer prices is less. History shows that when demand conditions are restricted, firms have to suffer lower profits rather than increase their prices. The current interest rate of 4% will also do a great deal to bring inflation back down, especially as there’s still more tightening in the pipeline. People with fixed-rate mortgages are not feeling the effects of the higher interest rate yet. And when interest rates on savings finally rise, banks will have to raise interest rates on loans further, too.  Trade unions see an opportunity to shift the balance between profit and wages. Could that lead to protracted second-round effects?  What I’ve been emphasising is that we are going to need to watch the labour market for quite a while. Collective wage agreements concluded in 2023 have to be seen in the context of a catch up from the high inflation last year. But to allow inflation to return to 2%, we need to see wage growth slow down in 2024. The unions know that the ability of firms to pay higher wages depends on the economic environment. And given the current, restrictive monetary policy we expect the economy to be pretty stagnant for the rest of this year and to grow modestly next year.  Germany is not doing particularly well, while other countries are faring somewhat better. How do you handle the differences within the eurozone? You can only pursue one policy.  We can basically only target the average. We're seeing that inflation rates are quite different across Europe and growth rates are different. But let me stress that alongside the ECB policy, it’s necessary to have good policies at national level. National policies should be designed to fill the gap if the single interest rate does not suit every country.  QE is over, but there are still a lot of bonds on your balance sheet. Large-scale bond sales would send interest rates shooting up and some countries would be in trouble. Aren’t you a hostage to your own balance sheet?  We have stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in the APP. That means the balance sheet is shrinking every month. Under the PEPP bonds are being reinvested until the end of 2024. A few years ago many people worried about how the bond markets would cope when we ended QE. Now we know the answer: if the interest rate is high enough, many investors, European and global, are happy to lend to European governments. Compared with interest rates, the role of the balance sheet is of secondary importance. The most effective way to tighten policy further, if necessary, is to further increase the interest rate. This will also keep the bond markets calm, since if investors no longer believed the ECB was tackling inflation effectively, they would demand higher interest rates. The worst scenario for European governments is if we fail to bring inflation back down to 2%, because then the interest rate on long-term bonds would be far higher than it is now.  Is 4% the peak policy rate, and when will it go down again?   Because inflation is too high, we're trying to deliver interest rates that are significantly above the neutral range. We will keep interest rates high for as long as necessary. If we have inflation shocks that are sufficiently large or sufficiently persistent, we have to be open to doing more. We think inflation will return to 2% by 2025. Only when we are sufficiently confident of reaching that target, we can normalise policy. But this is quite some distance from where we are now. I personally will need more information about the wage settlements for 2024, and we will have to wait until spring next year before many countries release that information. So it’s going to be some time before we can have a high degree of confidence that inflation is on its way back to 2%.  So no lowering of interest rates until spring?  We are data-dependent. The world is full of uncertainty. There are risks on both sides, but we still see relatively high wage increases and there are still some parts of the economy where price increases are happening. So we cannot make a near-term call. We’re going to be on guard for an extended period.  And what will be the “neutral” level, which neither stimulates the economy nor holds it back?  Before the pandemic inflation was too low and we were trying to deliver interest rates far below neutral rates. Now inflation is too high and we are trying to deliver interest rates significantly above the neutral range. We do not think that inflation will revert to pre-pandemic levels. This is also reflected in studies and market prices, which indicate that once inflation is conquered, interest rates will probably return to around 2%. Maybe that is a reasonable guess about the kind of long-term average for policy rates. We won't stay where we are now forever, but we also can’t envisage any scenario in which we go well below 2% without a major recession.   As the ECB’s chief economist, do you feel you have lost credibility by failing to see the inflation spike coming? Does that have implications within the Governing Council?  I think there are two issues behind your question. One is the natural question for people to ask, why did the economic profession in general, the central banking world, and indeed the Eurosystem and this includes me personally not fully anticipate what was happening. We made a whole range of calculations, but there was no scenario in which inflation suddenly surged as much as it did. So indeed, we did not see that coming. One lesson is that we have to be conscious that the world can change quickly. And that we need to express our humility in the face of uncertainty. And for me in my role as chief economist: it is my personal duty to learn from these episodes, to make sure our analysis is as good as possible. And I would say that the Eurosystem staff have also learned a lot in the last years. Our most important task is to ensure that the analysis behind our policies is as good as possible, and secondly that our monetary policy brings inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.  Many economists are saying that the hawks are now in the driver’s seat at the ECB. Is this a situation you recognise?  I believe this is not the way to think about how policy is made. And I think that’s probably a global situation. Inflation was so high that there was basically no discussion. This is not an episode where this kind of grouping across people is useful or necessary. It was obvious that inflation was too high and that a significant policy tightening was necessary. Press conference after press conference you could see that there was broad consensus or unanimity in the Governing Council.\n",
      "Content 15: The ECB raised its key interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in fourteen months, bringing the rate on the deposit facility to 4%, its highest level since the launch of the euro. Coming at a time when people are concerned about the level of interest rates, was this move justified?   We first need to put the action taken by the European Central Bank into context. For several years now the world has been facing a “permacrisis”, a constant succession of serious and unprecedented crises − in terms of their scale, their impact and the speed at which they emerged. The health crisis was followed by Russia’s unjustified war in Ukraine, and then by an acceleration in inflation. All this against the backdrop of the energy crisis, with a number of EU countries experiencing difficulties in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, including real estate.  The ECB’s mandate, unchanged for 25 years, is price stability. It’s our compass. The key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target.     Do you have the tools you need to fight inflation?   Our models were not perfectly suited to the nature of these crises, which resulted, among other things, in the complete shutdown of part of the economy during the health crisis, leading to a greater role for governments, which suddenly became protective. They were also not perfectly suited to the consequences of a war at the heart of Europe for the first time in decades, or to an energy crisis which sparked a sudden rise in inflation. The macroeconomic models used by central banks and other institutions were neither able to properly capture these kinds of uncertainties nor factor them into inflation and growth projections. We have worked on these issues, and we are continuing to do so, in order to make the projections more robust.   Have the past projection errors dented trust in the ECB’s actions?    Close to 80% of euro area citizens believe in and support the euro. And 45% trust the ECB, slightly more than did so before the health crisis. But we are constantly seeking effective methods and better channels of communication to explain our actions and counter fake news, which spreads far more quickly than the facts, also in the economic world. The ECB was the first central bank to acknowledge its errors with regard to the projections and to analyse the reasons for them.   And what are these reasons?  The errors were largely caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. Growth has declined across all economies – in advanced, emerging and developing countries. And there was an exceptional rise in inflation around the world, apart from in China. A very worrying situation, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.6% in October 2022, more than twice as high as its current level of 4.3%. That means that within one year, the efforts made – along with base effects, i.e. energy prices being much lower today than one year ago – have slowed the pace of inflation.  But that’s not the general feeling in Europe…  It’s hard to explain that the rise in prices is slowing down. Inflation persists, but it is abating and even steadily declining. That’s good news. I think our efforts have played a part in this, as have some of the economic policies pursued in Europe. At the same time, growth is weakening, which is why the International Monetary Fund has revised down its growth projections worldwide, except for the United States.  Why this gap with Europe?    Potential growth in the United States has traditionally exceeded that of Europe or of the euro area by close to 1 percentage point on average. It’s not meaningful to compare them: you can’t compare a single country with several countries. The euro area comprises 20 different countries, 20 different fiscal policies, 20 different treasuries. For a start, the United States is protected by the dollar, an international reference currency. The US economy is far more responsive and adjusts more rapidly. And it is not energy-dependent, unlike Europe, which has to import 80% of its energy.   Growth is falling in Europe. Is there a risk of recession?  We have revised down our growth projections to 0.7% in 2023, 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. The rate for 2025 is only slightly below the potential growth of the euro area. In Europe, we have devised a response and deployed unprecedented defensive measures that would have been unimaginable just three years ago, notably thanks to the Next Generation EU programme. Structural reforms are being put in place. And, just one year ago, who would have thought that we would succeed in replenishing more than 90% of our gas reserves by September 2023? This allows us to look towards the coming winter, if not calmly, then at least with a lot more confidence.   The German economy, the largest in the euro area, is slowing down sharply. What impact will this have?  This is one of the factors that is indeed weighing on the outlook for European growth. Germany had built its economic model on very cheap energy supplies and on export opportunities, especially to China. The ongoing adjustment in the German economy is affecting the growth outlook.   Does that complicate the ECB’s mission?  First and foremost, the ECB has to answer the question of how to provide price stability for economic actors across the entire euro area. To this end, we use tools that measure average inflation in the euro area, as well as underlying inflation – excluding energy and food.  In France, people are acutely aware of inflation. Why is that?  High and persistent inflation affects people’s purchasing power. But overall, while inflation in France is currently slightly above the European average, for a long time it was much less elevated than elsewhere in Europe.  Is this also due to the rise in interest rates?  Not exclusively. The ECB rates are the same for France as for all euro area countries. We have raised rates because this is the most efficient and effective tool that currently enables us to bring inflation down and ensure price stability.  Doesn’t this threaten growth?  Our mandate is price stability, and interest rates are our tool. We raise rates to make the financing of economic activity more expensive in a manner that dampens demand, and to thus bring about an adjustment between supply and demand, notably through reduced investment and consumption. The goal is obviously not to create a recession, but it does involve enabling this readjustment to reduce inflation and, above all, prevent a dangerous inflationary spiral. We must avoid this at all costs. We want to get inflation back to 2%, and we will achieve that.  Is there a risk of a wage-price spiral?  We aren’t seeing that for the moment, but we are monitoring it closely. Wage growth is expected to be around 5.3% in the euro area in 2023, and that figure is projected to be 4.3% in 2024 and 3.8% in 2025. This is consistent with inflation rates returning to 2% over the coming years.  Is the housing crisis that is picking up pace in France and Germany collateral damage from monetary policy?  The ECB sets the key interest rates in view of its price stability mandate. The housing sector is indeed sensitive to interest rates. But for many of the problems, all authorities need to get around the table and think about the stock of housing supply, and about social housing in particular. The fact remains that the major risk would be if people get into debt without having adequate means and are then confronted with repayment deadlines they cannot meet.  Is the ECB pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook?  There are three reasons why we are not pessimistic. We expect growth figures to increase next year. Inflation is currently falling significantly. And the employment rate is higher than it’s ever been in Europe, and it’s stabilising at that level. The big question right now concerns businesses. Will they accept absorbing part of the salary increases that will be negotiated this year and next in their margins – which didn’t change much in 2022? This is a key question. In our economic projections, we assume that businesses will behave as they have done during previous crises, in that they will reduce their margins a little in order to absorb part of the salary increases. The fall in demand should point them in that direction. It’s in their interest to do so, as public opinion will put them under pressure, as will the public authorities. The second element that is very important is energy prices. I think we have to get used to the idea that oil prices will remain high. This should spur us to pursue the fight against climate change even more vigorously, and to shift towards an energy mix that is less dependent on fossil fuels and foreign suppliers.  Anxiety is growing in European society in the face of a number of measures taken to fight climate change. How should we react?  We cannot wait. Combating climate change is imperative – we should all be hammering that message home. Everyone needs to realise it’s an emergency. We will only achieve this energy transition if we have everyone’s support, and with distributive policies that don’t worsen inequality. We cannot allow the energy transition to fail. Nor can we allow the consequences of climate change to become long-lasting. That is not an option. We have to find the fiscal and social means to make it as painless as possible for everyone, and for the most vulnerable in particular. A collective approach is needed. If there is any area where Europeans should borrow collectively, invest and share the burden as equally as possible, it’s the fight against climate change.  What will follow the current version of the Stability and Growth Pact?  I hope the European Heads of State or Government and the finance ministers will reach an agreement before the end of the year. The sooner there is an agreement on a reformed fiscal framework, the earlier we have clarity on the path of fiscal policies going forward.\n",
      "Content 16: From the ECB's perspective, have the new [September inflation] data brought about any changes in terms of the drivers of inflation growth?    Overall, the recent news on inflation is encouraging. Headline inflation in the euro area has declined notably, and it now stands at 4.3% after peaking at 10.6% in October of last year. A large part of the drop can be attributed to a reversal of previous shocks, as energy and food price inflation have fallen rapidly. It is also a consequence of statistical effects, the so-called base effects, given that we had unusually large price increases a year ago. When it comes to core inflation, which excludes energy and food, it has proven more stubborn and now stands at 4.5% in the euro area, hence above headline inflation. However, its September print was lower than expected.  It is welcome that inflation is coming down swiftly, but it is still well above our target of 2%, which we should aim to reach by 2025 at the latest to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored. Given the persistence of underlying inflation, that “last kilometre” may well prove to be the hardest.  How worrying is the oil price increase that we have witnessed in recent months?  The recent rise in oil prices is telling us that we cannot take it for granted that inflation will only move downwards from now on, because we could have new supply side shocks stemming, for instance, from energy or food prices. This year, we’ve experienced frequent extreme weather events, which may have an impact on harvests and lead to higher food prices next year. In addition, the base effects from energy may eventually reverse, putting upside pressure on inflation. Therefore,  we must not be complacent, and we should not declare victory over inflation prematurely.  What does it mean for the broad expectations among economists, the financial markets and even among central banks, that there will be no need for further interest rate hikes? That’s at least how the latest ECB messages have been interpreted.  One has to look carefully at what we communicated. We said that our decisions will continue to be data dependent. Our policy rates are now at restrictive levels and this will make a substantial contribution to a timely return of inflation to our target of 2%. However,  we cannot say that we are at the peak or for how long rates will need to be kept at restrictive levels. This will depend on the data, so we will continue to look at three factors: the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Currently, all of them are moving in the right direction. But I still see upside risks to inflation. There could be new supply side shocks. Moreover, wages could grow more strongly than expected, potentially accompanied by lower-than-expected productivity growth, while firms might not absorb those higher costs through their profit margins. Such risks need to be monitored carefully. If they materialised, further interest rate hikes could be necessary at some point.  Even though inflation has slowed considerably, there are still major differences in inflation rates among countries, ranging from negative numbers in the Netherlands to almost 9% in Slovakia. To what extent do these differences affect the setting of monetary policy? Are they really taken into account?  Our primary mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. Naturally, our monetary policy decisions also take into account information from individual Member States, but we cannot respond to specific developments in a particular country. Such developments are best tackled by national policies, such as fiscal or structural policies. The unusual heterogeneity of inflation rates is largely driven by differences in energy and food inflation. There are several reasons for the large role played by energy: First, countries that relied on Russian energy to a greater extent faced a stronger surge in energy inflation. Second, governments responded differently to the energy price shock, with some governments imposing price controls, which meant that they initially had lower inflation rates but may experience higher inflation later on. Of course, these measures also had different fiscal implications, because some of them expire automatically when energy prices fall, while others need to be actively reversed, which typically takes longer. And finally, the institutional characteristics of energy markets differ across Member States. In some of them, wholesale energy prices translate quickly into retail prices, both when energy prices rise and fall. In other countries the response is more sluggish due to the fact that there are fixed-price contracts in place with a long duration. One of the reasons why inflation in Croatia was so high was food prices, which constitute a large share of the consumption basket. This heterogeneity complicates our monetary policy, but we nevertheless need to focus on the euro area as a whole.  The government in Croatia, as well as in some other countries, is trying to introduce price controls on energy and certain basic consumer items. What is your view of these measures, what are the good and the bad sides of such an approach to lowering inflationary pressures?  Measures that directly control prices, such as price caps, have a dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which may be reversed once the measures are lifted. This helps to smooth inflation over time, but it also distorts the steering effect of prices. This may be counterproductive, because it does not incentivise lower consumption, for example, of energy. In addition, such measures can weigh heavily on the fiscal budget, especially if they are broad-based rather than targeting the more vulnerable groups. In general, measures that increase the supply capacity are preferable to those that directly control prices.  But do they work in the short run?  In the short run, they can have a positive effect in the sense that they lower current inflation, which may positively affect the inflation expectations of consumers, as these often depend on current developments in inflation. But overall, the negative effects often outweigh the positive.   One of the problems in Croatia, which has one of the highest inflation rates in the euro area, seems to lie in ample excess liquidity in the banking sector. This has increased strongly since Croatia joined the euro area on account of banks’ lower minimum reserve requirements. The argument is that this impedes the transmission of higher ECB interest rates and prevents a stronger impact on inflation. What do your analyses on the success of monetary policy transmission in Member States indicate?  What matters for monetary policy in a currency union is excess liquidity at the euro area level and not at the country level. Excess liquidity in the euro area is very high, but this does not impede monetary policy transmission. We have seen that the increases in our key policy rate, the deposit facility rate, have been fully transmitted to the money market and have translated into a measurable increase in funding costs in the economy. But you are right, monetary policy transmission can play out differently across Member States. One crucial factor is the prevalence of variable versus fixed-rate loans. The average lending rates adjust more quickly if there is a higher share of loans with a variable interest rate. Croatia is a special case, given that it joined the euro just recently. The drop in minimum reserve requirements from a level of 9% to 1% led to an increase in excess liquidity in the system. However, the strong loan growth that we are seeing in Croatia is not related to this but to the relatively strong economic performance, which is partly driven by the boom in tourism. That is why the Croatian National Bank decided to further increase the countercyclical capital buffer for banks to counter excessive loan growth. This is another way of dealing with the heterogeneity in a currency union, using macroprudential tools at the national level.  Would that be in the national central bank’s domain?  Yes, these macroprudential tools are mainly decided at national rather than European level – in Croatia’s case by the central bank – so they can be adjusted to the specific situation in a given country.   Do you see tourism as the main contributor to economic growth and credit activity in Croatia?  It is definitely one of the factors driving growth in Croatia’s economy. It has always been a very attractive place for summer holidays, and its attractiveness has probably increased since it joined the euro area. Two of my daughters, for example, travelled to Croatia recently, not only because it is beautiful, but also because it now has the euro.  The general public is concerned by the fact that banks are faring the best under the current circumstances, because they are generating high income from central banks without any effort or risk.   This is related to the high volume of excess liquidity created by our previous monetary policy actions: the lending operations and bond purchases, which we call quantitative easing. Excess liquidity is remunerated at our deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. In line with our interest rate tightening, we have now started to shrink our balance sheet, and this is happening very quickly, even though the balance sheet is still very large.  We need to pay interest on reserves, at least at the margin, to make sure that short-term money market rates are closely anchored to our policy rate and therefore in line with our intended monetary policy stance. Raising interest rates was necessary to bring inflation back under control. Now, what seems to create most of the unease is that banks raised their lending rates much more quickly than they passed these increases on to their depositors. But this transmission is getting stronger. Rates on time deposits have risen quite a bit, and we also see that people are beginning to shift their funds out of sight deposits into alternative investments that pay higher interest rates.  This market mechanism eventually forces banks to adjust their deposit rates. But this also means that banks’ funding costs will go up over time. Even though the impact on profitability is very positive in the short run, longer-term consequences of higher interest rates on bank profitability may well prove to be less benign, because the interest income on bank assets may rise more slowly than their funding costs.  The ECB recently abolished the remuneration paid to banks on minimum reserves, but there are proposals for an increase in the minimum reserve requirement ratio at euro area level to reduce liquidity in the system. What is your view on this?     In July, we had a comprehensive discussion on the minimum reserve requirements and their remuneration. We came to the conclusion that, from a monetary policy perspective, it would be appropriate to keep them at a level of 1% but to remunerate them at 0% instead of applying the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at 4%. Let me stress three points.  First, our main tool for adjusting our monetary stance is our policy rates and not minimum reserve requirements. Second, minimum reserve requirements are linked to the volume of deposits, which means that they mainly affect banks with high holdings of deposits rather than those with high holdings of excess liquidity. Therefore, they tend to put a larger burden on smaller banks. Also, these higher reserve requirements may lead to “avoidance strategies” by banks, which could remunerate deposits by even less or shift them to entities outside the euro area, where there are no minimum reserve requirements. Lastly, we are currently discussing the design of our future operational framework for monetary policy implementation. As long as we do not know the role that minimum reserve requirements will play in this new framework, we should be cautious about making any far-reaching decisions.  In any case, the reduction of excess liquidity through the shrinking of our balance sheet will continue for some time and, eventually, all our asset purchase programmes will go into full run-off.   Economic growth prospects have worsened quite substantially, with the possibility of recession not being excluded from forecasts. What is your understanding of the drivers and the consequences of this recent deterioration in the business climate?  Over recent months, we have seen that most economic indicators point to a slowing growth momentum. We first saw a pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector, which started to spread to the services sector as the reopening effects from the pandemic faded. The Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMIs) for manufacturing are in deeply contractionary territory, and those for services are also signalling contraction. Consumer confidence has increased notably over the past year but remains at low levels. All this is pointing to subdued economic developments over the rest of this year.  While a technical recession cannot be excluded, there are no indications of a deep or prolonged downturn. One reason is the labour market, which is still quite resilient, resulting in strong nominal wage growth. As inflation falls, real incomes are rising, which supports economic growth going forward. What is clear is that our monetary policy will continue to have a dampening effect on economic growth.  So, there is no reason for concern of a deeper recession setting in?    We see indications of a period of stagnation but not of a deep or prolonged recession.  Still, the state of the economy in Germany, as a country that is a very important export market for many EU Member States, is not encouraging. How justified are the claims that Germany is currently the “sick man of Europe”?   Germany is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. Its economy has been hit twice: by the energy price shock and by weaker growth in China. This has exposed structural weaknesses linked to the dependence on cheap energy and on a booming economy in China that was eager to buy German manufacturing products. On top of this, Germany faces challenges regarding demographic developments, as it has a rapidly ageing society implying an increasing scarcity of labour, as well as the green transition which, as in many other countries, is facing political obstacles. Cyclical factors, i.e. weak domestic and foreign demand, will eventually fade, but the structural factors may weigh on potential growth and hence have longer-term effects. All this implies that  Germany, as is the case with many other countries, will need to adjust its business model to the changing global conditions, as well as to its domestic challenges.  How likely do you think that is?  Germany has managed to transform itself in the past and I am confident that it will be able to do so today. Naturally, this requires strategic thinking and openness to change. In particular, the green transition offers Germany vast opportunities to regain its technological leadership. The economy will pick up eventually, but the main issue concerns long-term potential growth, and that depends very much on how Germany tackles its structural challenges.  Arguments that the global economy is generally entering a phase of weak growth and disinflation are gaining ground. What do you see as having the most impact on inflation looking ahead?  What we see in the euro area is that domestic price pressures have gained importance over time and they are now the main driver of core inflation dynamics. When input costs rose sharply, many firms raised their prices in excess of the cost increase. So we saw an increase in profits in many sectors, also due to temporary supply-demand imbalances caused by bottlenecks and reopening effects. As a result of rising prices, employees experienced a drop in real wages. Now employees are trying to regain lost purchasing power, and tight labour market conditions are making it easier for the unions to negotiate higher wage increases. It is through such second-round effects that inflation becomes more persistent. The weakening of the economy, which is partly due to monetary policy transmission, makes it harder for firms to pass through higher wage costs to prices, meaning they may need to absorb higher costs through their profit margins. We see indications that this is happening. How this will play out over time will be one factor determining how persistent inflation, particularly underlying inflation, will be going forward.   There is a major difference of opinion as to how corporate profit margins over the last period have spurred inflation growth, with some analyses pointing to the conclusion that they were totally irrelevant.  Inflation is not only the result of rising wages or higher energy prices. Profits have also increased quite a lot over recent years. Looking ahead, the question is by how much wages will increase and to what extent rising wage costs will be absorbed by profit margins. It is only natural to expect that the unions and employees will try to regain some of the lost purchasing power and that wages will grow. But it is crucial how firms respond, and that depends on demand conditions and hence on our monetary policy.  Fiscal policy is expected to be prudent and cautious in order to curb inflation. However, politicians have their own concerns, such as a decline in the living standards of their citizens and in investment. On account of its widening fiscal deficit, Italy is again in the spotlight, and so is an increase in its bond yields. How does one reconcile these opposing goals?  We have long argued that governments need to promptly roll back their support measures from previous years, which were often not targeted enough and have risked fuelling inflationary pressures. However, we have also learnt over the years that consolidation should not come at the expense of necessary public investments. What really matters is the composition of public spending, which should aim to make the economy more productive and to strengthen the supply capacity. This in turn benefits fiscal sustainability and is also having a disinflationary impact over the medium to long term. Therefore, it would be unwise to postpone public investments and structural reforms that are necessary to transform the economy. This is where the European funds come into play. The Next Generation EU programme can help countries to continue investing in their future. At the same time, the perception that the government can counter every economic shock through fiscal transfers is dangerous and could lead to unsustainable fiscal dynamics.    When it comes to recent yield movements in global financial markets, the largest part is driven by a general repricing of longer-term rates, as markets are anticipating interest rates to be held at a high level over a longer period of time. These higher funding costs imply that governments need to be even more prudent.  The ECB’s position that the price of borrowing will remain high for as long as necessary to reach the target inflation rate has been communicated quite clearly. Nevertheless, is there anything else that can be said in that context?     Our policy is data dependent, which implies that the level and duration of restrictive rates will depend on how the data develop. What is key is that there is no doubt that we will do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to our target in a timely manner. That is then also embedded in inflation expectations. One of the big successes of our determined monetary policy actions is that we were able to keep inflation expectations broadly “anchored” around our target, in spite of painfully high inflation rates. Our September interest rate hike underlined our determination to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner.\n",
      "Content 17: It’s been two weeks since the ECB raised rates for the tenth consecutive time, have you now done enough to tame inflation?  Let me stress an issue, which is sometimes slightly overlooked but is a very important part of the discussion, namely the transmission of monetary policy. That's crucial in order to understand the decisions that we have taken and those that we will take. In transmission you have two different legs. The first one is from our monetary policy decisions to financial markets and banks. In that first stage, the transmission is almost complete. You can see it. In the banking channel, there has been a tightening of financing conditions following our decisions. And there has been a significant drop in the demand for credit.  The second phase is how the impact of the tightening of financing conditions feeds through to the real economy. And here there is much more uncertainty. We have seen a slowdown in economic activity. But there are other factors behind that, for instance the impact of inflation on households’ disposable income and the evolution of exports, which is related to the slowdown in the global economy. The key point that will determine our future decisions is how intense the transmission of our monetary policy will be to the real economy, and indirectly to inflation. That is why we believe that the present level of interest rates, if maintained over time, will give rise to a reduction in inflation towards our definition of price stability.   Do you worry about the risks of overdoing the tightening of monetary policy and driving the economy into an unnecessarily painful recession?   We do not at all want to create an unnecessarily painful recession. We must bring inflation to our definition of price stability while simultaneously trying to minimise the pain that could create in terms of a slowdown in the economy. This is, at the end of the day, a very delicate balance. If the transmission is incomplete, then we should be a little more patient. If the transmission is much closer to completion, then we should consider the next steps to guarantee that inflation converges to our target.   Does the recent rise in oil and gas prices, coupled with a weaker euro, make your task more difficult?   Yes, it makes our task more difficult. I would not say that it is a game changer. But my concern is that the rise in the oil price could have a detrimental impact on inflation expectations for households and corporates.   What would it take for the ECB to start cutting rates?   Well, we are not there.   But what would you need to see?   First of all, progress in a very steady way towards our definition of price stability, i.e. to inflation of 2 per cent along with projections indicating it will remain at that level in a sustainable way. Starting to talk about rate cuts now is premature. We have reduced inflation from more than 10 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Still, I think the last stretch is going to be more difficult. We are on our way towards 2 per cent. That’s clear. But we must monitor that very closely, as the last mile will not be easy.   But would the last mile be the hardest to achieve in bringing inflation down?  First let’s look at the factors in favour of disinflation. Base effects have an impact. Supply side bottlenecks have started to fade away. And there is monetary policy and the clear slowdown in the economy. In the second half of the year the economy in the euro area will have stagnated.  Now let’s turn to factors against disinflation. There’s a spike in oil prices. Wages are growing about 5 per cent on average. Demand for services is high, even though we have started to see a clear slowdown. And the euro has depreciated.  So, when you put all this in the balance, our predictions indicate that inflation will continue slowing down over the next months. But we need to monitor it very closely because the elements that might torpedo the disinflation process are powerful.   Are governments making inflation worse by continuing to run big deficits?   The first factor with respect to fiscal policy is the withdrawal of the subsidies granted over the last two years, which must be completed before the end of 2023. But it’s not only that. There is also the fiscal stance, which sometimes gets overlooked. My impression is that after four years without EU fiscal rules, governments may have got used to a little bit of a “whatever it takes” approach with respect to fiscal policy. But that has to change. Having a tightening of monetary policy and, simultaneously, an expansionary fiscal policy would be a very bad policy mix. And being more concrete, what would be detrimental is a fiscal deficit that goes above the level of 2022.   Does the ECB need to reduce the amount of excess liquidity in the banking system?   We are doing that. And this is totally normal in the process of normalisation of monetary policy. That is the correct pace, the correct path. TLTRO reached €2.1 trillion and now we are a little bit below €500 billion. And over the next year it will become close to zero.  What about stopping reinvestments in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme?  Some of my colleagues in the Governing Council have been quite outspoken with respect to the need for starting the process of quantitative tightening on the PEPP. But in the formal structure of the Council, we have not even started the discussion. It will arrive sooner or later.  Do you still need the flexibility of PEPP reinvestments as the first line of defence against financial market fragmentation, despite not having used it for two years?  If you ask the military, they will tell you that extra lines of defence are always good. Yes, we could use flexibility in the reimbursement of the PEPP to address fragmentation. It has not been used for two years because spreads are quiet. The PEPP is less than €2 trillion. Therefore, even doing a full run-off, the withdrawal of liquidity will not be huge. It is the first line of defence in times of volatility in markets, but that is not the case now. So, we’ll have to analyse it.  How about the banking system? Do you expect an increase in non-performing loans?  Return on European banks’ equity has clearly improved because of the widening of net interest margins after the increase in interest rates and it is now above 10%. Two years ago, it was around 4%. But banks’ valuations have not moved in parallel. Why? I think that the main reason is because the cost of equity of the European banks has increased quite a lot and it’s close to 15%. When interest rates increase, the cost of equity also goes up. Markets are also pricing in that the improvement in profitability will not be sustainable over time because they are factoring in an economic slowdown. And they price in that banks will have to increase provisions should non-performing loans levels go up.  This means profitability will be dented in the future. The current figures are a sort of illusion. In the pipeline, we start to see that the quality of the assets is deteriorating, and there’s an increase in non-performing loans. On top of that, taxes on bank profits have created some uncertainty.   Should countries not introduce bank taxes?   Not all bank taxes are identical. You have seen that in the case of Italy. The final proposal is much more sensible than the first one. Our point is very clear: these taxes should not impair credit and should not create any limitation in the capitalisation of European banks. This applies as well in terms of the banks being prudent in dividend payments and share buybacks, and even the remuneration of bankers.  Some members of the Governing Council would like to increase the minimum reserve requirements for the banks, on which you pay no interest. What do you think of that?  My opinion is that we should conduct monetary policy based on price stability, not on the profit and loss of national central banks. To reach price stability, you have to reduce liquidity. The reduction of liquidity will give rise to a reduction of these windfall profits that the commercial banks are getting at the moment because of increasing interest rates.   Are there any signs of distress in the property sector?   In commercial property there has been a very important decline in prices, mainly in some Nordic countries. The main problems have appeared in Sweden, Finland, the Nordic countries. But it’s quite pervasive. Residential real estate is more resilient. But, for instance, in the case of Germany, it was not a total surprise to see the recent data showing that house prices have declined by almost 10%. That’s a clear indication that there were some pockets of overvaluation that are going to be corrected. Our concern now are the non-banks, the property and mutual funds, that have a big exposure to real estate. I would say that commercial property – even though we also need to pay attention to residential property – is our main source of concern in terms of financial stability.\n",
      "Content 18: Your speech at   Terschelling   was something of a departure for a central banker, in that it was clearly very personal, while at the same time seeking to counter a certain pessimism regarding attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Are you concerned that there isn’t sufficient buy-in at the moment from, as you put it, “those who pollute, those who finance the polluters, and those who supervise the financiers of the polluters”?  Looking back at the past five years, there are many things that clearly show we are not transitioning to a zero-emission economy fast enough, with all the problems that brings economically. On the other hand, many other things are going in the right direction. My main message was that we can do this, but we need to be fast. The later the transition, the higher the cost, as our recent economy-wide climate stress test has shown. So I might have used a little more pathos than I would have done if speaking here in Frankfurt, but the message is just as clear.  Is the ECB doing enough?   As supervisors we have a multi-year strategy. We published our expectations for climate-related and environmental risks in 2020. In 2021 we asked the banks to conduct self-assessments of where they stood vis-à-vis these expectations. On the basis of what we saw a year ago, the glass is slowly filling up, but it is not yet half full and it needs to be full by the end of 2024. I do see progress – banks are now better equipped to manage climate-related and environmental risks than when we made our initial assessments. Each of our expectations has been met at least once by a bank we supervise. The glass is filling up – but it is not yet full. Building on what the banks themselves found reasonable, we set a series of interim deadlines: the first at the end of March this year, the second at the end of 2023 and the last – by which banks need to satisfy all our expectations – at the end of 2024. And we have said that we will use all our instruments to enforce these deadlines if needed.  Banks understand that we mean what we say and that this is within our mandate, because climate-related and environmental risks translate into financial risks which must be managed by the banks. This is also acknowledged worldwide. Although you do still see differences in how fast and how ambitious supervisors are, the fact of these risks being within their mandate is no longer controversial. That is a real step forward, and one which also reflects the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example.  But in that speech and others you’ve highlighted the urgency that’s required. Is that compatible with what is arguably still a very gradualist approach aimed, essentially, at trying to bring banks along with you, rather than you saying “you absolutely have to do this now, and if you don’t there will be consequences”?  First of all, ask the bankers. I don’t think that they would say that this is extremely gradual – many banks probably feel that we are pursuing this rather enthusiastically. There are clear deadlines − also interim deadlines − and we will enforce them if necessary. To be very clear, that includes periodic penalty payments. That’s not a step we take lightly, so I think that this shows how serious we are when we issue supervisory expectations. Do I particularly like that? Well, I believe it’s better to convince the banks. I know we’re asking a lot, and some banks would say it’s very difficult and claim that they can’t really do anything because they lack the data. But it is also true that the risks don’t become smaller just because they are difficult to measure. There is still a lot you can do short of perfection. But the risks are out there, and they will not wait until 2030 or 2050 to materialise – so we need to make real progress. Patchy data are better than no data at all. The same is true of the emerging art of climate modelling. Patchy climate models are better than nothing, but if you don’t even identify the gaps, you cannot really make progress towards filling them. There are many other things banks can do besides climate modelling, and we have also published a guide of best practices for banks that sets out these numerous options.  So looking at it from other directions, is there anything more that the ECB could, or should, be doing beyond compliance, such as making green investment more attractive? Might we one day see the green TLTROs (targeted longer-term refinancing operations) that commentators were discussing not so long ago?  Whereas up to now we’ve been speaking about what we are doing in our banking supervision, you are now asking a question about what we might consider in our monetary policy. Talking about possible future instruments is of course highly speculative, because whenever we design an instrument, we take into consideration all the circumstances of that particular moment. Any instrument needs to be effective to pursue our primary mandate of price stability, and it needs to be proportionate. It also depends on the environment – whether we are in a period of policy tightening or accommodation. But climate considerations are clearly part of the monetary policy strategy we adopted in 2021. I think it’s fair to assume that we will take climate considerations into account in the features of any type of instrument we may design in future − including any purchase programme.  In your speech you also mentioned the extent to which national governments subsidise fossil fuel industries. Obviously, there are limits to the ECB’s mandate, and maybe this is pushing those limits. But insofar as this issue constitutes a financial stability risk, can the ECB play a greater role? Or should it be left to private citizens to pursue the issue through the courts?  You’re talking to a lawyer, and the overriding requirement through all of this is that we act within our mandate. And when I talk to banks, I point out that we are seeing exponential growth in climate-related litigation. From our perspective, banks need to manage that risk at a time when there are certain cases in which the courts have endorsed rather far-reaching legal theories, including against states. It can no longer be taken for granted that those judgments will not be repeated or set a precedent, and that is something banks should be acutely aware of.  You said recently that there will be a just transition or no transition. Could you unpack that a little?  What I wanted to say there is that, if you look at what is happening in the world, it is clear that there is a risk of a growing antagonism – that the energy transition and climate crisis become politicised. All EU Member States have committed to becoming Paris Agreement-aligned. Not delivering on that, or postponing the transition, will lead to an economically suboptimal situation where the transition ends up being more costly. Our own analysis has also shown this time and again. Bringing attention to this issue is within our mandate.  If we could turn to monetary policy – In your last Governing Council meeting, the ECB raised interest rates again. For the final time in the cycle?  We have said it very clearly: we consider that, with the decisions we’ve made and on the basis of our current assessment, the current interest rate levels will make a substantial contribution to us reaching our inflation target in the medium term. Does that mean policy rates have peaked? Not necessarily. There is still a lot of uncertainty. That’s why we take these decisions meeting by meeting, on a data-dependent basis. Making any predictions about what we will do next would not be consistent with that approach.  How do you see the balance of risks to the inflation outlook? Is it simply that the latest hike puts the ECB on a sounder footing by guarding against any additional upward price pressures?  I think that’s exactly what it is. Of course, there are upward risks to inflation. There could, for example, be upward pressures on food and energy prices – since July we have been alluding in our monetary policy statement to the importance of weather and climate conditions in this respect. Climate change could also lead to a shift in longer-term inflation dynamics, but we need much more granular analysis into how exactly physical and transition risks will ultimately affect inflation. Helpful distinctions have also been proposed by my colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Isabel Schnabel, analysing the impact of climate change itself, the ongoing dependency on fossil fuels and the green transition. Some aspects are certainly inflationary – 2022’s summer heatwave increased food inflation by 0.67% compared with the year before, for example, so that’s rather significant. But it could also be the case that, over much longer horizons and depending on how the transition goes, energy will become much more abundant and cheaper.  Do you see any evidence that the current interest rate environment is having a negative effect on green investment?  Any interest rate decision has an effect on investment, both green and non-green. In the end, I think the best we can do is make sure that we deliver on our price stability mandate. That will create the stable environment in which the transition – including the required investment, which needs to be sped up – can take place.  How concerned are you about the growth outlook for the euro area? Or does the primary mandate of price stability ultimately matter more?  What we’re seeing is a more protracted period of sluggish growth than we were expecting. Of course, we need to look at the various explanatory factors, such as lower demand for euro area exports, the impact of tighter financing conditions, lower residential and business investment, and the weakening services sector. On the other hand, labour markets are still strong and disposable income is expected to rise, which would have a stabilising effect on overall GDP growth. It’s also true that our primary mandate is to deliver price stability, and I think we have proven we are very determined to do that, as seen in the ten rate hikes that we’ve decided on since July 2022.  So would you consider cutting rates if growth were to surprise significantly to the downside in the coming months?  I think I’ve explained very clearly how we take our decisions. We take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and we look at all the incoming data. We are comfortable with the decisions that we have taken on the basis of our recent assessments, and we will weigh any incoming data carefully, as always, in relation to our inflation outlook.  Would you need to see inflation clearly and consistently trending below 2% over the course of your medium-term projections before considering a cut appropriate? Equally, would reinvestments need to have stopped by that time?  Let me stick to what I have just said. As you know, we stand ready to adjust all our instruments as needed. Based on today’s assessments, we are comfortable that a substantial contribution is being made to the timely return of inflation to our target. We will keep rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.\n",
      "Content 19: You opted to raise rates for the tenth time last week, bringing rates to an all-time high of 4 per cent in the eurozone. Inflation is still stuck above 5 per cent. Yet you seem to have signalled that you are finished raising rates. Why? Could you explain?  Well, I think the way to think about it is we think inflation will come down from low fives in August to low threes by the end of this year. So last autumn was really the peak of intense inflation pressure. We had very strong gas price increases last year, which peaked in August 2022. And essentially this autumn, there will be base effects where that 5 per cent inflation rate comes down into the threes. So the 4 per cent interest rate is there to bring inflation from around 3 per cent at the end of this year back to 2 per cent in 2025. That's the scale of the underlying inflation challenge. And this is why this rate of 4 per cent, we think, is going to do quite a bit in bringing inflation all the way back to our 2 per cent target.  So then, do you believe keeping rates at current levels is enough to bring inflation back down to target if held for an extended time and thus further rate hikes are off the table at this point?  So I think we have a lot of evidence in euro area that monetary policy is working. Credit is basically flat now. It's come down from strong credit growth to where lending to firms and households is pretty muted. The economy is growing at a very low rate. So all of the signals are there that monetary policy is working. There's more slack being built up in the economy and this, we think, will make sure that, over the next year or two, price increases and the underlying cost increases such as wages will remain fairly contained. But as you just said yourself and the way you phrase it, this is a point-in-time assessment from last week. I think the overriding message, which I think is global really from central banks, is high uncertainty. And so we're emphasising that we do think this 4 per cent rate will do a lot, but we're also, I think loud and clear, saying: number one, this rate has to be held for long enough to make sure inflation is firmly on its way back to 2 per cent. So there's a lot of power in the messaging that this needs to be held for sufficiently long. And then second, we're totally open in adjusting our policy over the next year or two as we see the incoming data. So still very data dependent. We're sending a point-in-time conditional message in terms of what we saw last week and this decision. But of course, we meet every few weeks. What I said last night when I spoke here in New York is: there's going to be a lot of data points, not just at the end of this year but stretching well into next year, that we need to see before we would have a high confidence that indeed inflation is firmly on its way back to our target.  So then base case, it sounds like you are prepared to hold rates for an extended period, but if you need to, you would raise interest rates again?  Well, I think this is totally straightforward. All central banks have to be in a situation these days where it's not a good idea, it's not productive, it's unhelpful to kind of commit to a forward guidance where we say these rates are going to be held no matter what. But equally, I think that this message should not be over-interpreted. You would expect a central bank, if we saw the inflation assessment going off track, if we saw the net signals from the incoming data saying that actually more is needed, of course we would do more. But that is purely a process issue. It's saying in response to kind of sufficient deterioration in the inflation dynamic, we would do more. And that's just reflective of the uncertainty we're living in in these conditions.  As you look to hold for an extended period, what ballpark does that look like to you? Is it at least through next year, given how you expect data to evolve?  I think it's important to really take a look at the calendar. I don't think it's a good idea to kind of give calendar guidance, such as you were trying to suggest. What I did say last night is that, for example, one of the big issues in the European case will be where wages come in in 2024. And maybe a bit differently to here in the United States, a lot of wage negotiations are episodic. A lot of wage settlements for 2024 will only take place in January, February of 2024. In many countries, it's kind of institutional settings where there might be a once a year reset. And so we're not going to know about 2024 wages really until well into 2024. And that's one of the key elements in the dynamic we need to see for inflation to come back. So that's not a complete kind of dimension. It's just one dimension, but it's a very important dimension in thinking about the calendar that we will be following in looking at the incoming data. Another way of saying that is really, this autumn we will learn a lot, but we're not going to learn everything. So it is going to be, I think, a topic that's going to be stretching well into the new year in terms of understanding the data we need to see in order to move further in the adjustment back towards the target for inflation, which in turn at some point will unlock a kind of normalisation of monetary policy.  You lowered your growth forecast significantly for this year and next. You now see growth of 1% or less. Some market watchers are concerned about the somewhat fragility of the eurozone economy, especially if you were to hike rates again, though, I know you're very data dependent, but how is the ECB looking at that right now, are the risks to the downside?  Let me characterise it as essentially this year, 2023, we only have three months to go at this point. We do see this year as being fairly muted, an economy that's not growing very much. And then we do have a pickup really from the start of next year. Because this year, I mean the legacy of the pandemic, the legacy of the massive 2022 energy shock, the connected problems with the war and so on, is that there's a lot of reasons this year for the economy to stagnate. But as incomes go up and remember, you know, basically from this point forward, we do think wages will grow more quickly than inflation. People's incomes are going to pick up and this will help consumption. On the investment side, there's been a big adjustment for a year and a half now of the same construction. This already started happening in early 2022. And as that adjustment concludes we will start to see, I think, investment returning. Let me emphasize, the overall environment remains, if you like, not fragile. The banking system is in good shape. Because of the pandemic, household balance sheets look in better shape than normal. Same for corporates. So the kind of toxic mix you need in order to kind of trigger a deep recession is not present. This monetary tightening, which we need to do to kill inflation is in a context where we don't see the fragilities that happened 15 years ago. It's very much a special situation where the monetary tightening can bring inflation back to target, which absolutely does slow down the economy. But this is slowing an economy which has momentum, has resilience, and we do expect to see a pickup next year and the year after which will bring the European economy to grow. So we have unemployment rising, but to a very limited extent. It's a very unusual disinflation episode.  Is Europe in a better position this fall and winter, given the ongoing war in Ukraine when it comes to energy than if energy prices were to spike you are in a better position to handle that? Certainly we have already seen global supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia, Brent crude at a hundred dollars a barrel or so. But how are you looking at that and the possibility of that creeping into core inflation and causing inflation to remain elevated for longer?  This is why we did raise the inflation forecast for this year and next, because of that material change in the outlook for oil over the summer. What you just referred to is a very important factor we will be looking at: will it broaden out? Will higher energy costs trigger a new round of price increases across the services sector, across manufacturing? What I would say in relation to that is historically, there was a limited pass through from energy to wider indicators. The environment now is quite different to a year ago. With these restrictive interest rates, we've relatively contained demand conditions. A firm might wish to pass on high energy costs to their customers, but they're much more at risk this year of losing market share if they try to do so. We do think – and this is by the way one of the reasons I cited last night for the move to 4% interest rates –it will moderate any possibility of an energy shock or food shock . We are concerned about food prices, the ability of that to amplify into core inflation is less at a higher interest rate. So interest rates now are much higher than a year ago. So that kind of amplification effect, I think that risk is lower today than it was a year ago.\n",
      "Content 20: Let’s dive straight in and talk about the broad inflation outlook. What are we seeing?  We’re speaking today, 31 August, and this morning we had the flash data for August. Of course, in any given month, the change is relatively small, but what we did see is some easing in the elements of core inflation. So goods inflation and services inflation came down, which is very welcome. But, as I said, one month of data is only one piece of information; we need to see that continue. What I would say is: our calculations are basically that there were very strong price increases a year ago, which will fall out of the data this autumn. So we do expect to see this famous core inflation come down throughout the autumn. Let me now turn to the other big components of energy and food. Energy came in stronger. The first half of this year was dominated by this spectacular decline in the price of gas. Also, oil markets were contained. There has been some movement in recent weeks on those categories, which partly includes, in some countries, the lifting of subsidies, essentially. Now they are saying: at some point you have to remove the supports that were put in place last year. So we do expect, with energy and food, some bumpiness. But let me summarise that as: the latest data show that inflation is standing at 5.3 per cent overall, which remains high, but in terms of looking for signals of momentum and signals of directional change, I would underline the fact that there has been some easing in goods inflation and services inflation, which is a welcome development.  In terms of the key trends, are there any anomalies in this month’s reading?  Let me first of all emphasise that this is just the flash; the detailed inflation data don’t come out until the middle of the month. So we will have to see. But what is really important: some of the conjectures about the summer, whereby maybe we would continue to see quite strong services inflation, including coming out of the obviously still strong demand for tourism in many countries — services inflation remains significant, but the fact that there was some easing, I think, helps to limit that narrative. The most visible change over the summer was some turnaround in both the oil and gas markets. That remains a major source of uncertainty. As you know, in some of the gas markets, it has to do with some factors which may dissipate. But what I would say is that, after having seen a lot of welcome downward drift in energy inflation for most of the year, we will be keeping an eye on this situation.  Based on the flash estimate, give us a sense of short-term and long-term inflation forecasts and how those are aligned with your obvious mandate, the mandated inflation target.  Let me emphasise that the work to put together the September forecast is still ongoing. But if I go back to the June forecast, and indeed the basic narrative that has been there all year long, it is: remember where we were last autumn. Inflation was around 10 per cent last autumn. Essentially, what we had even at the end of last year was an assessment that a lot of this inflation would fall away in 2023, with further progress in 2024 and in 2025. And that basic shape of the inflation dynamic, where it’s a multi-year process, so 10 per cent inflation doesn’t collapse to 2 per cent very quickly, but the direction of a significant drop this year… It’s already halved from 10 to 5, with further progress expected this year. That reflects the fact that this 10 per cent inflation arose very quickly and had a clear connection to a number of supply factors. As those supply factors are reversed, you would expect to see some easing. But it’s also the case that it’s a multi-year process because there is a second round. And this year is really the year, we think, of peak second round. So this year, we are seeing significant wage increases. And again, the projections in June basically had an assessment that the overall wage adjustment would be multi-year: the biggest adjustment this year, where we’ve had average wages across the euro area growing north of 5 per cent; growing north of 4 per cent in 2024; and north of 3 per cent in 2025. So, well above historical trends but, crucially, on a declining path: five, four, three. In the calculations for September, we’ll have to see where we are on that. That inflation, again, does not collapse to our target rate quickly because that second round has to play out to some extent. The policy challenge is to contain it, to make sure that the second round is contained and does not become embedded. So the whole challenge here is: let’s get back to 2 per cent in a timely manner, to use our phrase. What is a timely manner? It’s sufficiently quickly that everyone understands that the current inflation episode is time-limited, it’s temporary, and therefore you should not change your longer-term behaviour embedding the idea that inflation would remain high. We want people to understand that this is a temporary inflation episode. It’s not going to disappear overnight, but at the same time it would be a mistake to extrapolate the high inflation we’ve seen into a longer-term projection.  I want to turn to the causes of inflation. So the concept of sellers’ inflation, which is very much associated with the economist Isabella Weber from UMass Amherst, and others of course – what’s your take on this? How do you see the potential for the kind of strategic price controls that she and others advocate on vital sectors as an emergency response to local shocks?  I think we need to break this down into some components. We absolutely do have to understand how firms make their decisions. Because, as you say, that is the proximate mechanism between whether prices rise quickly or stabilise: it is the decisions of firms, that is absolutely true. So let me then think about what the constraints facing firms are. One constraint facing firms is their cost base. And essentially, I think the scale of the increase in energy prices in Europe in 2022 just made it essential for many firms to raise prices. They would have gone bankrupt if they’d had to fully absorb the rise in energy costs. And that’s across the economy, many service industries – running a hotel is very energy-intensive, transportation, a restaurant... So there are many sectors which ended up being in our core measure, which are very energy-intensive. The cost element is there and you might say that’s not strategic, it’s an imperative. If a cost rises enough, you can’t absorb it and lower profits; you have to raise prices. Then there is a strategic element, which is: okay, I might have a cost increase but in the market conditions I face, can I as a firm also add on extra profits in that environment? Again, I think 2022 was a unique period in some sectors. In the energy sector, the way pricing is set is that it’s basically the marginal source of energy that determines the price. Essentially, there’s a windfall there for many utility firms, which might have lower-cost inputs, but they received that marginal price. So we saw significant profits in some types of utilities. In some manufacturing, and agriculture, there are a lot of global forces in pricing. In 2022 some of those global forces meant prices were quite strong and, again, essentially a windfall for the firms. That is reversing this year in many ways. So those firms now, if they want to be globally competitive, have to accept the different economic environment. Then we come to the domestic firms serving the national economy or the European economy. Here, again, 2022 was unique. If you go back to March 2022, you had this co-timing: the start of the war and the post-pandemic reopening of the European economy. So what we saw in spring 2022 and throughout the summer was essentially two forces. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in the cost of energy. But with the pandemic, there was a kind of reopening of many services, entertainment, hospitality, plus people had quite a lot of money in their bank accounts from not being able to spend during the pandemic. That is the perfect environment for strategic price increases. Going back to the question: in 2022, it’s clear that there was, I think, a significant contribution from strategic pricing. This year? Our assessment for this year and the coming years is that the profit component is going to fall. That environment, which was so supportive of price increases, we don’t think it’s there and we think it’s going to get even more restrictive over time. And that’s where monetary policy is playing a role. Essentially, the interest rate policy we have is basically dampening demand. Firms know that, if they try to raise prices too much, they are going to lose too many customers. So there is a constraint on that pricing this year.  I think the history of price controls is that ultimately it’s not going to be the best way to fight inflation. They may contain inflation temporarily but we saw with the Nixon policies, for example, in the 1970s that essentially, once they are lifted, a lot of the suppressed pricing re-emerges. I think there’s a distinct debate – and let me emphasise that it’s distinct – which has played out in countries like France, for example, which is that it is not price controls, but essentially having various forms of fiscal intervention that limit the sharpness of the inflation increase. In turn, if you limit the intensity of inflation, then you may weaken second-round effects. There’s a lot of that still playing out and that remains an interesting issue. But price controls as such – I think I’d be in the sceptical camp that that’s the best way to deal with this. Again, I think many people recognise around the world, in many sectors, there is more market power than there used to be; there is more monopoly power. But that was true before the pandemic and is going to be true after the pandemic. So then the question is: how does market power interact with, essentially, the unusual environment? And I think that it may have played a role in 2022. But if it was just firms arbitrarily raising prices as they like, I don’t think we’d see the scale of disinflation that we are seeing already and that we expect to continue to.  I want to put to you a question that I’ve been asked a lot. It runs as follows: in the context of inflation driven by pandemics and wars, how effective do you believe interest rate hikes can be or would be? It’s often been put to me that this is not where you’re trying to dampen demand in one place. Perhaps it might be worth phrasing this in as simple a way as possible: why is it that, through no fault of their own, Irish homeowners who are paying a little bit more in interest rates, who have gone through the pandemic and the war – why, for example, are interest rate hikes dampening demand the solution?  Let me again locate the role of monetary policy in all of this and let me come back to the basic pattern here: inflation rose to around 10 per cent at the end of last year and, as we talked about earlier on, we do think a lot of this will fade away just through the reversal of the supply shocks that had caused it. So then the question is: should monetary policy be kind of invariant? Just say that these supply shocks will fade away and therefore, monetary policy can just remain invariant. The reason why that’s not enough? Let me go into that. Number one: the most basic task is to avoid making the inflation problem worse. If you have a high inflation rate – even if you expect it to ease over time – and a very low interest rate, that creates a lot of pro-inflationary incentives. Basically you may say: “well, now is the time to borrow a lot of money because prices are going up. I should buy things now and then sell them later on.” That’s true whether it’s in the asset market or the goods market. So, to avoid pro-inflationary behaviour, it’s important that interest rates go up enough. That’s essentially the most basic reason why we normalised interest rates and have now moved into restrictive territory. We have published on our website our assessment that inflation would have been, I think, several percentage points higher than it is now if we had left interest rates super low, because that dynamic would have taken over. One counterfactual is that keeping rates super low, when inflation is going to be high on a multi-year basis, could have led to this kind of procyclicality, which would make life even worse.  Number two: I talked about a second round where firms raise prices because they have higher costs, and workers require wage increases because they’ve lost living standards. Then the question is: how do you make sure that process is contained? Because we know that if inflation gets embedded, it can be quite high for an arbitrarily long amount of time – this famous phrase of “tit-for-tat” inflation. The original shock is gone but, in any given quarter, firms are raising prices because they expect workers to be looking for higher wages, and workers are looking for higher wages because they expect firms to keep on raising prices. This is where dampening demand through higher interest rates means, as I said earlier, that firms know they have to limit their price increases, and workers can be confident that, because inflation is contained, their loss of living standards is not so much at risk. You mentioned that in the context of households and mortgages. That is definitely one channel but I think, in the euro area, the bigger channel is the behaviour of firms, especially in sectors which have a lot of debt: manufacturing, capital-intensive sectors, the tech sector. The tech sector is important here in Ireland. We know that for firms whose revenues are later but whose start-up activity is now, their ability to fund activity depends on interest rates. So the interest rate policy, we think, works through industry sectors and I wouldn’t overemphasise, in the European context, the mortgage channel. It is the most visible channel in some countries but I think that how firms respond to high interest rates is probably more dominant in the overall mechanism.  I want to talk a little bit about modelling. All models are limited. They’re obviously vague representations of reality. But could you elaborate on any limitations you perceive in the current ECB models for predicting inflation and give us a sense of how they are going to be addressed? In 2020 and 2021, the ECB was forecasting inflation around 2 per cent. It was already incorrect, even before the war. So what aspects of these models underestimated the eventual outturn of inflation? Was it the commodity forecast assumption? Was it the labour market? You mentioned wage growth already. What do we take from that going forward?  Let me try and describe a little bit about how the ECB forecast is assembled. Of course, we spend a lot of time on this, but let me at least give you a basic description. So we do have macro models, which indeed are calibrated for normal business cycles. Absolutely. But we also have two additional components. One are so-called satellite models. You might say, well, if we have a sense that the normal model might not be capturing everything, you can customise a satellite model and work through what might happen under different scenarios. Then the second element, which sort of connects that, is staff judgement. The forecast would only take a few seconds if we just pressed a button and ran the model. A lot of the effort in the forecast is trying to assess: in what way is the model wrong? And what kind of judgements should we include? Maybe I’ll come back to the various satellite models that you could run to help you form that judgement. They are informed judgements as opposed to just arbitrary judgements.  Then let’s think about what happened. I’d say part of it is they take some parts of the economy as exogenous, or by assumption. As part of this, it was assumed that the recovery in oil and gas prices compared to the worst of the pandemic would happen, but would be fairly measured. Honestly, even in late 2021 we saw a recovery in oil prices, but it was kind of orderly. What I would say is that, on the energy component, the main issue was the war. And I think it’s fair to say the war was an unexpected event. If you fed a model with a larger, more persistent energy shock, it would produce more inflation. So one issue is what you feed into the model. Maybe I’ll just pause there to say, again, if we return to a world where, essentially, energy shocks or other types of shocks become more normal, do we think of the pandemic as a once-in-40-year event? Do we think of the war as a once-in-40-year event? Where essentially you might say “we’re learning a lot about what happens in these rare events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that how we think about normal times needs to be revised”. And this comes down to the second part of how the forecast is made: in real time, thinking about judgement. Because you can understand that we have, I think, very good modellers at the ECB. They’re well able to design a non-linear model, they’re well able to bring in the kind of strategic pricing we talked about – the understanding of what happens if you have a big enough shock that firms abandon their once-a-year revision of prices and they move to revising prices much more frequently; of what happens, similarly, if workers suffer a very large unexpected inflation shock, and therefore, for a given amount of unemployment or a given amount of profits, they need much bigger wage increases than normal. We can model that. But of course, while we now have ex post concrete evidence, that doesn’t particularly help you ex ante. What I would say more generally in terms of the modelling discussion is that there are many non-linear possibilities out there – so there is this setup where you have a basic model, which remains traditional, but you also have a range of alternative models in your toolbox which can handle various non-linear mechanisms. Then let me come back to the policymaking. Both in the pandemic and in relation to the war, we did publish some scenarios. In the end, those scenarios did say that you might get more inflation, but nowhere near the scale we’ve had. So it’s a fair comment to say that the scenarios we looked at were maybe too local. And there’s a fair question, which some of my colleagues have highlighted, where we need to widen the scope of what we think the distribution of risk is. But again, the big question is: is all of this to do with these very unusual circumstances? And how much will remain relevant on a day-to-day basis in the future? Let me make a link to the Jackson Hole speech by President Lagarde. What is very true is that we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve got the war, but we have a lot of other things going on. We have geopolitical fragmentation as a risk, we have the green transition. So let me highlight those two especially. We also have demographic transitions and so on. The 2020s is one of these big decades, I think. We do spend a lot of time thinking about how all of those factors may renew the focus on significant supply shocks. But again, once you have the shock captured or identified, then I think the macro models do a reasonable job. In other words, I think the big issue is not so much the models. It is the diagnosis of what’s going on. Once you diagnose what’s going on, the models can impose a useful discipline on thinking about how it’s going to play out. That’s really where the judgement has to come in. But again, let me emphasise for a central bank, we meet every six weeks. We meet eight times a year. It’s a continuous process. It’s not a case of making a one-time-only call. Over the last couple of years, clearly, we kind of changed our call. And I would say that over this year, the basic call has been that we will come down from high inflation, but it’s going to be a multi-year process. A number of months into that, a lot is lining up with that diagnosis, but a lot of uncertainty remains.  Could you just elaborate briefly, and I know it’s something we’ve spoken about before, about the ‘just transition’, particularly with climate change. What is the ECB’s understanding of climate change as a series of supply shocks, demand shocks? We talked about the widening distribution of risk. If we just confined climate change to damage to infrastructure caused by extreme weather – it’s an entirely reductive thing, but if we just confined it to that – if we have extreme wildfires across Europe in summer and we have flooding in winter, that alone damages enough of the productive capacity in the economy to require a monetary policy response. Would you agree with that assessment or is that something that needs further study? I know the ECB is working on this but it just strikes me, as you say, the just transition – you're absolutely right, but what role does monetary policy have to play?  I think there are a number of elements to it, but maybe the most important analytical issue is that all that you mentioned operates both on demand and supply. Sometimes you come up with calculations about the inflation impact that might be lower than you first thought. Essentially, this damage to supply has to be pro-inflationary. On its own terms, yes. But a firm that loses the value of its capital stock, a homeowner who was hoping to consume but now has to allocate her savings to retrofitting her home, means that the consumption demand also falls, together with the supply. So the net impact on inflation, and therefore the role of monetary policy, is maybe relatively contained. If you look at, for example, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook from last October, essentially, that was one of the big messages – the inflation effect is there, it’s not zero, but, basically, it is relatively limited. Let me come to two more significant scenarios. What I would emphasise is that, clearly, the transition has major implications for fiscal policy, has major implications across the economy. Everyone has to make significant adjustments. But I would not put the impact on inflation at the top of that list. One of the issues is that in the transition, there does need to be significant investment, both public and private. That can be supportive of economic activity, but then the funding of that investment is going to be very important, because of course, if essentially it requires rotation away from consumption and towards investment, that will lower consumption demand in the economy. If it calls for higher taxes, it will reduce disposable income. On the other hand, Europe has a significant current account surplus, so if the rise in investment is basically financed by running smaller current account surpluses, then the net stimulus to the economy will be bigger. So there are many conjectures. As you say, we’re working quite hard, but let me come to our absolute fundamental bottom line here: what Europe needs is significant, sustained action, because the worst-case scenario is not doing it and then, later on, when it becomes disastrous, having a massive recession because of the extremity of a high-stress situation. Then monetary policy would have a significant challenge, an unwelcome challenge if it’s coming from managing a disaster scenario. So pre-emptive, steady, significant investment to support the transition is absolutely what we want to see. As I mentioned to you, I don’t think the net effect on inflation is going to be zero, but because it operates both on demand and supply, it’s relatively contained.  I want to talk about labour market shortages. We currently have labour market shortages in many parts of the eurozone. And there’s a significant decline in working-age populations in places like Italy and elsewhere. How do you think about these changes in what you described (and I agree with this description) as a big decade? And how do these changes influence monetary policy decisions?  The demography element has multiple elements to it. It’s visible already. The demographic transition is quite predictable, and 20 years ago, 15 years ago, we could say “Oh, yeah, it’s going to kick in during the 2020s, we’re going to see it”. We actually are seeing it, less so here in Ireland because it's still a relatively young population, but we know it’s coming. It’s visible in a number of countries. Then, how do we think about it? Yes, we do think that there’s a human capital dimension to the labour market issue, because you’re losing many people with decades of experience and skills. One of the questions is: do we have the education and training policies in place to make sure that the new entrants to the labour market can quickly work at that level? One of the big open questions is the margin of immigration. And we’ve actually seen a surprisingly strong return of immigration in the last year or two. One issue is improving participation rates. Here, I think working from home provides an important opportunity. We are seeing improved participation by older workers, by women as well. I think it’s reasonable to say that working from home helps that. All of those factors are relevant, but let me again come back to the supply and demand issue. Less supply of workers also means less demand, because as people go into retirement, they demand less, especially if you combine that with increases in longevity. An increase in longevity means, in basically every age group, people are revising upwards how long they have left to live. That is a very basic factor reducing consumption, because you have to save more to cover the fact that you happily expect to live longer. And all of that of course interacts with fiscal policy. My sense is that changing demography has huge implications for health systems, fiscal policy and the overall growth rate of the economy. But for monetary policy, it goes back to this basic issue: how much does it differentially affect demand versus supply? In the first order, it basically just acts in a similar way on both demand and supply.  Living in Ireland in the 2010 period, the ten-year bond spread became a thing that we all looked at. Now it’s not something we look at. It was very interesting that through the COVID period and beyond, peripheral spreads never widened appreciably. How has the ECB managed to avoid peripheral spreads widening? What implication does this have for future monetary policy?  Let me divide that into several phases. Clearly, Europe suffered this sovereign debt crisis, both vis-à-vis larger countries and also smaller European countries, and we noticed it very much here in this country. If you go back to 2012, especially, there was a lot of pessimism about the future of Europe. Number one, we did have the actual recovery from that crisis. That crisis led to many reforms, including the Single Supervisory Mechanism, much higher bank capital to the extent they are a lock on future banking crises, macroprudential rules, including mortgage rules here in Ireland, and a rebuilding of fiscal capacity through much lower deficits. Also in the private sector, much more risk aversion. Households are deleveraging quite a bit. So we went into the pandemic in better shape. The pandemic itself, initially in March 2020, led to a lot of pressure, but of course, there were two intertwined responses. One is we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which was important not only in terms of an overall stabilisation bulwark, but also its flexibility was important to contain the flight to safety dynamic. It’s important to underline that, in a common currency area, the risk factor at a national level is higher because people can run without taking currency risk. You can run out of any individual country without taking currency risk. The PEPP was, I think, well designed to contain that. What was also needed – and it remains very important now – is that it went hand in hand with Next Generation EU, which basically said: we’re not going to ask each country to handle the pandemic on its own. We’re going to have this layer of pooled fiscal resourcing, which will be directed to those countries that are most exposed. This played a very important role and it continues to do so, because that money is now being spent in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and so on. That’s a very important type of stability. So I would say that period was very important in the policy response. Then if I turn to right now, let me emphasise: we have a cyclical inflation problem, not a long-term inflation problem. Short-term rates have gone up, people expect us to keep rates high for quite a while, but not forever. Going back to ten-year rates, people expect rates to come down later in the decade – but not to pre-pandemic levels. I think the surveys show the market thinks that our policy rate will come down to about 2 per cent. So it’s not going back to zero or negative, but it’s a lot lower than it is now. So, if you price a ten-year bond, it’s several years of high rates and then, further out in the decade, it’s something around 2 per cent. If you have that cyclical view of the problem, this is why I think those spreads are contained. Let me emphasise: this is why it’s so important that we do keep these short-term rates high for sufficiently long. Because if we did not do that, then people, I think, would build their expectations that inflation would basically become de-anchored, and then those ten-year rates would go up. Then those countries that are most vulnerable, I think, would disproportionately suffer. We often say it, and I think it’s fundamentally correct, that medium-term price stability, getting back to 2 per cent, is the cornerstone of a more stable financial system, including stable sovereign debt markets.  Final question. As the ECB chief economist, you’ve lived through interesting times. What have you learned? What would you have done differently?  We’re learning all the time. Absolutely, a central bank is very much learning all the time. We have a lot of analysis going on. It’s a very rich environment for an economist to work in. What I would say, however, is that we’re midway through this inflation adjustment. What I outlined here earlier on is this vision, this narrative, is a multi-year perspective but inflation will come back to our 2 per cent target. There’s a risk around that and if you think about the 1970s, having launched so much economic research, so many retrospective assessments, what we know now about the 1970s is very different from what you might have written in 1975. I think a lot of the ultimate assessment will have to wait a couple of years to know how this turns out. So I’m not going to give you a major conclusion now. Much will depend on our basic assessment – that the conditions are there, both through the monetary policy but also through the reversal of supply shocks, for inflation to come back to our target in a timely manner in a couple of years. At that point, we can, I think, be better timed to do a full retrospective. More narrowly, we have been focusing our retrospective on the forecast issues. It goes back to what I said earlier: a lot of it was basically that the energy shock was not predicted. It’s a shock that is not intrinsic to the model. And then this basic idea that, essentially, we incorporated some deviations from the normal model, but not enough. But again, whether this was so obvious ex ante, I’m not sure.  We need to write more papers. Spoken like a true academic!  For sure. Maybe it's a good way to finish on this. One of the main messages from President Lagarde’s Jackson Hole speech was humility. In line with that, we very much have to emphasise the uncertainty. We do have lots of good analysis, but in the end, the analysis depends on the diagnosis. And the diagnosis is really where the judgement calls come in. It’s important for all of us to think back to that period, late 2021, early 2022: given and rerunning those analyses, what could have been plausible alternative decisions?\n"

      "Interview Preprocessed: 'Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all. Can central banks claim much credit for bringing inflation down?     It's a myth that the inflation trajectory would have been the same in the absence of monetary policy action. Monetary policy was and remains essential to bring inflation down. If you look around, you see signs of monetary policy transmission everywhere. Just look at the tightening of financing conditions and the sharp deceleration of bank lending. Look at the decline of housing investments or at weak construction activity. And importantly, look at the broadly anchored inflation expectations in the wake of the largest inflation shock we have experienced in decades. Then ask yourself whether what we are seeing would have happened in the absence of monetary policy action. It's true, of course, that part of the decline in inflation reflects the reversal of supply-side shocks. But monetary policy has been instrumental in slowing the pass-through of higher costs to consumer prices and in containing second-round effects.   But doesn’t monetary policy act with this famous lag? Given that the ECB started tightening policy less than two years ago and only stopped in September, doesn’t that mean we are yet to see the full impact of your rate rises?    There's indeed a discussion about the lags of policy transmission. My view is that we are probably past the peak of transmission. This also connects to the question about the last mile of disinflation. Initially, we had the quick wins of disinflation, which is the reversal of the supply-side shocks. We've seen that quite impressively with inflation coming down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 to 2.9% only a year later. Since then, inflation has remained broadly stable. I would argue that we are now entering a critical phase where the calibration and transmission of monetary policy become especially important because it is all about containing the second-round effects.   You once drew a parallel between the final part of disinflation and long-distance running. Do you still think this last mile is going to be the hardest part?  Yes, the last mile remains a concern. We are observing a slowdown in the disinflationary process that is typical for the last mile. This is very closely connected to the dynamics of wages, productivity and profits. We had a sharp decline in real wages, which was followed by strong growth in nominal wages as employees are trying to catch up on their lost income. The services sector is affected particularly strongly because wages play a dominant role in its cost structure. At the same time, we've seen a worrying decline in productivity and there's a discussion about what is driving this. One of the factors is labour hoarding, which has happened on a broad scale. Other factors could be the composition of the workforce, such as the integration of less productive workers or a higher share of public sector employment, and possibly an increase in sick leave. The combination of the strong rise in nominal wages and the drop in productivity has led to a historically high growth in unit labour costs.   Does that mean inflation will remain sticky?   The crucial question is: how are firms going to react? Will they be able to pass through higher unit labour costs to consumer prices? This is where monetary policy comes in because it works by dampening the growth in aggregate demand. If demand is held back by restrictive monetary policy, it will be much harder for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers. They will be forced to absorb at least part of those higher costs. This is critical, in particular during the last mile, and we are seeing some evidence that it is happening. But this process is rather protracted and quite uncertain because the economy could pick up more strongly than expected. That could encourage firms to again pass through costs to consumers. In fact, if you look at selling price expectations in services, they have gone up for several months in a row. That’s why recent incoming data do not allay my concerns that the last mile may be the most difficult one. We see sticky services inflation. We see a resilient labour market. At the same time, we see a notable loosening of financial conditions because markets are aggressively pricing the central banks’ pivot. On top of that, recent events in the Red Sea have sparked fears of renewed supply chain disruptions.  Taken together, this cautions against adjusting the policy stance soon. It means we must be patient and cautious because we know, also from historical experience, that inflation can flare up again. I'm referring to a recent research paper from the International Monetary Fund, which showed that the flare-up could happen several years after the initial shock.   But there’s little sign of demand picking up in the euro area. The economy is stagnating and has hardly grown for the past year.   The latest PMI survey confirmed signs of a turnaround. We also saw the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index turn positive for the first time in many months. This may be another sign that we have passed the peak of policy transmission, so there is less impact from our restrictive monetary policy. We see that bank lending rates are starting to come down. If you look at online portals for mortgage rates, for example in Germany, you see they have declined quite a bit . I'm not saying that a flare-up in inflation is going to happen. It’s not my baseline, but I think it's a risk we should be prepared for. This is an argument against adjusting the policy stance hastily. We have made substantial progress, and that is good news. But we are not there yet.   Is there now less value and importance attached to models?  Everybody has a model in their mind, whether you write it down in mathematical equations or not. Any policymaking has to rely on models about how the economy works and how our policy decisions affect different parts of the economy. So, models are indispensable.   The recent surge in European inflation was mostly caused by supply shocks, not by demand. When these shocks fade is there a risk Europe could return to the low inflation, low growth environment that we had for much of the past decade?  Let me say first that I do not fully share your assessment of the roles of demand and supply-side shocks. I do think, also in the euro area, that demand played an important role with pent-up demand and the reopening effect. We've seen that over quite some time. So it’s not all supply-side driven.  But let me come back to your question whether Europe is going back to a secular stagnation type of environment. As policymakers, we have to form a view about longer-term developments. And the best way to do that is to think in scenarios. The outcome depends very much on government action. One of the main questions for me is how governments are going to respond to climate change. I see a more benign and a less benign scenario. The more benign scenario would be one where everybody recognises the importance of transforming the economy and doing so relatively quickly, implying that there's going to be a lot of investment, public and private, which is going to push up economic growth. This will probably increase inflationary pressures, as I've explained in several speeches. This could be related to carbon pricing or to the demand for certain metals and minerals. Inflation could also arise from higher food prices due to extreme weather events. Even in this benign scenario, however, you have a countervailing effect on economic growth, because part of the capital stock will become obsolete. But this is still a scenario where you would not go back into a low-growth, low-inflation environment.  The less benign scenario is one in which governments delay the green transition, possibly due to political pushbacks. In such a scenario, there would be a risk that low growth comes back. However, it would be more of a stagflationary scenario with low growth and still relatively high inflation. Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.'\n",
      "Interview Original: '  INTERVIEW  Interview with Financial Times   Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Martin Arnold on 2 February 2024 7 February 2024  Now that inflation is fading, some say it was transitory after all.

Eventually, investment would probably need to rise even in this scenario, as economies need to adapt to climate change, but this would come later.  Apart from climate change, there are many other challenges ahead affecting long-term growth prospects. We face a massive demographic challenge. We face geopolitical shifts. And we face changes in globalisation and digitalisation.  All of those factors are relevant for the real neutral rate of interest, or R-star. This measures the real rate of interest at which inflation is at target when the economy is in a steady state. It gives us an idea of where borrowing costs could end up. Do you think the neutral rate has gone up in recent years?  R-star is conceptually very important for the appropriate calibration of monetary policy. The problem is, it cannot be estimated with any confidence, which means that it is extremely hard to operationalise. One could look at market-based estimates. These have typically gone up. But we have to be careful with these market-based measures, because we could be falling into the trap of Paul Samuelson's monkey in the mirror. In a very interesting paper, Sebastian Hillenbrand from Harvard Business School shows that the secular decline in US government yields can be explained by very narrow time windows around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meetings. What does that mean? Maybe none of us knows where R-star is going to be. But markets extract information from the public communication of central bankers, rightly or wrongly. Hence, if we look at those numbers that are out there in the markets, we possibly don't learn anything. We might be looking in the mirror.   So what do you think has happened to R-star?  There is a lot of research about the earlier long-run decline in R-star. The global savings glut is often mentioned as one important factor. The question is whether this downward trend may be turning around.  I think there are good reasons to believe that the global R-star is going to move up relative to the post-financial crisis period. First, there’s eventually going to be a push globally towards higher investment in response to climate change. We are already seeing this with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and the developments in China. I expect a significant increase in global investment, be it for the green transition or adaptation to new climate conditions.  The second reason is government debt. The demands on governments are continuously rising, for example due to higher costs of an ageing population. Another important factor is going to be defence. It looks as if defence spending has to go up a lot. As a result, I would expect government debt to rise, which would also tend to push up R-star. As regards demographic change, an ageing society might lead to more savings, which would push R-star down. But on the other hand, once the population is older, they may actually need to spend part of their savings, for example because they have to finance long-term care, or they simply want to spend their money during their remaining lifetime. There are many other aspects to consider. The process of digitalisation, for example, requires high investments, too. Also, importantly, with less globalisation we should not count on the savings glut in global financial markets. So, overall, I would argue that there could be a turnaround in the trend of R-star.   Why does R-star matter?   What we really care about is the short-run R-star, because it is relevant to determine whether our interest rates are restrictive or accommodative. The problem is we don't know where it is precisely. This implies that,  once we start to cut rates – and as I said, we're not there yet – we must proceed cautiously in small steps. We may even need to pause on the way down if inflation proves sticky and the data does not give a clear picture about how restrictive our monetary policy is. Just as we did over the past year, we need to look at the economy in order to assess how restrictive our policies are.   I want to ask you about money supply. You gave a speech on this last year. I know it has been an important focus, and it is close to German central bankers’ hearts. How much of a role does the money supply have on inflation?  First let me say I'm a European central banker and a German citizen. What I showed in that speech is that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between money growth and inflation. This can be explained by looking at two different periods. One is the period after the launch of the ECB’s asset purchase programme in 2015. That was a time when a lot of central bank reserves – base money – were created. But we did not succeed in lifting the economy out of the low inflation environment. Why was that? The reason was that the balance sheets of banks, firms, households and governments were relatively weak. You remember, after the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis there was little willingness to grant loans and to invest. Inflation did not come back as much as the ECB would have hoped.  The other example is the pandemic. By then balance sheets were much healthier, partly due to government support. We had strong loan growth despite the deepest economic contraction since World War II, and inflation came back. The question now is: what is the role of money supply in all of that? One point I stressed in that speech was that the growth in money supply was an early warning sign that inflation may be more persistent.  I do believe that it was a mistake to not consider the signals from money growth. It's not a simplistic mechanical relationship. It’s plausible that the broad money supply made it easier for firms to pass through higher costs, which may then have helped to entrench the adverse cost-push shocks. But that is open to debate.  The interesting question is what is happening on the way down? Money growth has been subdued for a while now. Part of that is simply a reflection of our monetary policy transmission, that is the deceleration in lending growth. But there's more to it because we are coming out of a period where money holdings were unusually large because the opportunity costs of holding money were so low. You could simply hold your money as a sight deposit and it wouldn't matter much. But that changed abruptly when interest rates moved up. We've seen quite impressively how people shifted their money into other asset classes.   Has there been a reassessment about the effectiveness of bond purchases as a tool to manage inflation?  I see three objectives of asset purchases. The first is market stabilisation. The second is monetary policy accommodation. The third is monetary policy implementation. Let me start with the first one. There is a broad consensus that asset purchases are a highly effective tool to stabilise markets, and we've seen many instances of that. We saw it during the pandemic. We saw it in the gilt market stress episode in the UK in the autumn of 2022. And it is also the logic behind the ECB’s Transmission Protection Instrument. The idea is that when you face market disturbances, asset purchases can instil confidence at a time when markets can’t coordinate. What then matters is the flow of asset purchases over a short period of time. We saw in the UK example that these types of purchases can be reversed relatively quickly. And then they're a profit-making activity, because central banks buy assets when nobody else wants to buy them and sell them when the prices have recovered.  Second, monetary policy accommodation. The views here are somewhat more dispersed. What is clear is that quantitative easing is an important tool when the economy is at the effective lower bound at which further interest rate cuts are no longer feasible. They then work by compressing the term premium, that is mainly via the longer end of the yield curve. What matters here is not the flow of purchases but the stock of bond holdings. This is why it is the announcement of new purchases that plays the key role. But the success of these programmes is not guaranteed. As discussed before, the ECB’s asset purchases before the pandemic were not as successful in bringing inflation back to our target as we would have hoped, because their effectiveness depends on the economic environment. At the same time, they have side effects. They have an impact on market functioning, fiscal discipline and financial stability. And given that it's not so easy to reverse them, they may be a loss-making activity a long time after the purchases have been conducted.  Shouldn’t central banks ignore these losses?  We shouldn't be structurally loss-making over longer periods of time. Losses may at times be unavoidable if required to preserve price stability – that's correct. But we cannot ignore the potential reputational and credibility effects that come with losses. This is something we need to keep in mind.  And the third objective?  The third objective of asset purchases is monetary policy implementation. It means we can use asset purchases to structurally provide liquidity to the financial system through a structural bond portfolio. Of course, one has to think about how to calibrate the size and the composition of that portfolio, which goes back to the side effects I mentioned earlier. Maybe you don't want it to be too big. And when you are concerned about interference with the monetary policy stance, you may want to focus on shorter maturities.  Overall, asset purchases are an important part of our toolkit, but we should use them wisely and in a proportionate manner so that we are sure that the benefits outweigh the costs.     What is the optimal size of the ECB balance sheet?   It actually changes over time. The size of the balance sheet depends on many factors, including the macroeconomic environment. But there are two main structural determinants of the balance sheet. First, the autonomous factors, the most important part being the amount of banknotes in circulation, plus required minimum reserves. Second, the demand for excess liquidity by the banks, which has increased significantly, partly due to new regulation. This demand also depends on the operational framework we are in, which we are discussing at the moment. If holding liquidity is costly, banks will economise on liquidity, which would lead to a smaller central bank balance sheet. We plan to publish the outcome of our operational framework review in the spring. Our framework will be tailored to the specific features of the euro area financial system, which is strongly bank-based and has a lot of heterogeneity. It's important to stress that this framework will have no direct implications for the process of quantitative tightening, which will continue to gradually proceed in the background.  What are the lessons you draw from the last three or four years?   What I’ve learned is that we shouldn't believe that the world tomorrow will necessarily be similar to the world today. It can change very quickly. I would like to tell you an anecdote. When the book “The Great Demographic Reversal” by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan came out, we were in the middle of the pandemic. Inflation was falling and turned negative in the second half of 2020. We had experienced too low inflation over many years. Everybody was concerned that inflation would remain low or drop even further, while interest rates were already at the effective lower bound. Then the book came out and said that the real threat is too high inflation and not too low inflation. I remember that I discussed it with some people and the reaction was that this should be disregarded because it was not relevant at the time. I believe it would have been wise to listen to an economic historian like Charles Goodhart, who has seen the world changing many times. The problem was that we were so caught up in our thinking and this also influenced our policy reaction.  We tied our hands too strongly by forward guidance and the way we intended to sequence the end of our policy measures. I think this is the main reason why we were a bit late on both ending asset purchases and hiking interest rates. So going forward, we should maintain more flexibility. If we ever went back to forward guidance, it should be of the Delphic type, which is a forward guidance conditional on economic data, but not the Odyssean type, where you tie yourself to the mast figuratively speaking.  We've also learned something about the reversibility of policy measures. Once we started, we moved from a deposit facility rate of minus 0.5 % to a rate of 4% very quickly. This took a little more than a year. We are also moving out of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations pretty quickly because they have a fixed maturity and because of the possibility of early repayment. The absorption of that has been very smooth.  But what is much harder to reverse is the big stock of asset purchases. You have to be very gradual in doing that. This creates a big legacy for the future. And this is something that we need to discuss.   '\n"

      "Interview Preprocessed: 'In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening. What happens if the ECB finds a banker inadequate on climate?  We obviously have the advantage of being able to inspect the inner workings of all banks. And we see that a lot is going well at banks in the area of climate risks, even if no single bank has currently met all of our expectations. But I don’t see any bank completely ignoring climate risks either. Should this happen in the future, a moment would come where we would have to ask ourselves whether the people at the helm are still fit for their task.   How do banks endanger the economy by underestimating climate change?   Through credit risks, for example. When banks lend funds to the agricultural sector, where climate change leads to lower revenues, then the risk heightens that those loans are not repaid. Or take mortgages: if banks finance houses on sites that are increasingly prone to flooding, credit risk will rise too. There is also a transition risk, in other words, governments can set rules to counter climate change. In the Netherlands, for example, you can only let out office buildings that have energy label C or higher. Imagine if a bank has lent funds to a business letting out offices without a valid energy label – that would again exacerbate the credit risk. Or what if cars running on diesel were no longer allowed in Amsterdam? If companies don’t prepare for this in good time, their investors will also become vulnerable.   And there is also a legal side, Elderson adds. The Dutch environmental organisation Milieudefensie has brought ING before the court on the grounds that the bank has made itself complicit in the climate crisis through its multi-billion loans to polluters. Through those loans, ING is emitting the same amount of greenhouse gases as all ten million Swedish citizens collectively, Milieudefensie claims. Elderson: ‘We have been reminding banks already for years that it is crucial for them to properly identify the legal risks too and control them'.   You say that climate change also affects price stability. How exactly?   Take the summer of 2022. The record-breaking heat caused lower crop yields. ECB research shows that, as a consequence, the food price inflation over the following twelve months was 0.8% point higher. Or think of the drying up of the Rhine back then, which resulted in a measurable decline in German GDP. Or of the floods in Slovenia last August, of which the damage to the Slovenian economy is estimated at 5% of GDP. But also look at the energy transition, which is creating a high demand for metals to make batteries and other goods, possibly pushing up the prices for all kinds of commodities. All of this affects price stability and is hence relevant for the ECB.  Not everyone sees it that way. Critics ask why the ECB doesn’t leave climate policy to elected politicians.  I completely agree. And that’s what we are doing – leaving climate policy to the politicians. But of course we also look over the fence to see what climate legislation politicians draw up and we take the consequences of those rules into account when exercising our tasks. Don’t forget that alongside our primary objective – price stability – there’s also a second objective that we must pursue under the EU Treaties as long as this doesn’t endanger price stability: supporting the economic policies in the European Union. This therefore also applies to the European climate plans agreed on by elected politicians over the past few years.  In the Treaties there are also all kinds of other objectives the ECB is supposed to promote, such as peace, free trade, gender equality or ending poverty. You don’t hear as much from the ECB about those.  Of course we’ve also asked ourselves that question: who are we to choose between these goals? And for precisely that reason, we don’t. Because we see that climate policy is a top priority in Brussels and in the EU countries, including in the economic policies. There’s the Paris Agreement, a European Climate Law and the European Green Deal – whereas some of the other agendas you’re referring to are very laudable, but politically have lower priority. Therefore it’s not surprising that the ECB is promoting the objectives that the legislators themselves are prioritising, and for which they set clear targets and deadlines.  In recent years inflation has often been above the 2% target. With that in mind, aren’t you biting off more than you can chew?  I think it’s a misconception that we would have to choose between price stability and climate risks. How can we ignore that floods in Slovenia caused 5% of national income in damages? How can we ignore rises in food prices, when we know that temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come? Even if we didn’t care one iota about the climate, we would fail in our mandate if we stuck our heads in the sand on this issue. And as we’ve shown for almost the past two years and demonstrated again last week: we’re determined to bring inflation back down to our target of 2% and we’re making good progress.  Meanwhile the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, takes the attitude “every man to his trade”.  I completely agree. But monetary policy then needs to be tailored to the insight that we won’t be able to understand the financial system anymore if we ignore climate and nature crises and governments’ transition plans. They want to move to an economy that’s net zero in 2050, meaning that on balance we wouldn’t be adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere anymore. We’ve been following the oil markets closely for decades, because energy prices are highly relevent to our monetary policy. And now we see the world making its entire energy economy more sustainable. Is it then really supposed to be outside our mandate to try to understand this change in depth and to act according to these insights?  So has Powell got it wrong?  I can totally relate to what he said, as long as you see our job as including everything relevant for price stability. If you look at our mandate, there’s no way you can reach any other conclusion.'\n",
      "Interview Original: '  INTERVIEW  Interview with De Volkskrant   Interview with Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Jonathan Witteman on 29 January 2024 3 February 2024  In its introduction to the interview, the newspaper refers to and quotes from speeches of   September 2023   and   November 2023   as well as from the interview itself, ending with references to the sanctions that the ECB can impose and the fit and proper requirements for bankers.    Coming from a supervisor charged with assessing bankers, those words sound quite threatening.

      "Interview Preprocessed: 'Has the euro zone reached peak inflation?  It’s probably too early to make that judgement, but I would be reasonably confident in saying that it is likely we are close to peak inflation. But whether this already is the peak or whether it will arrive at the start of 2023, is still uncertain. The main uncertainty is that we’ve seen so much volatility in gas prices. In some countries, consumer prices have moved a lot, while in others for example some utility companies have not yet finished hiking prices. Given the significant increase in prices, I don’t rule out some extra inflation early next year. Once we are past the initial months of 2023, later on in 2023 – in the spring or summer – we should see a sizeable drop in the inflation rate. That said, the journey of inflation from the current very high levels back to 2% will take time.  Next year, will inflation go down to 6-7%?  The initial downshift from the current high rates will be to around that level but I would expect further reductions throughout next year.  Is it possible that core inflation will go up while headline inflation goes down?   This could happen, because a big driver of core inflation at the moment is the fact that many sectors across the economy, such as transportation and tourism, use a lot of energy, so when there is a high increase in their energy costs, they have to raise the prices of the services and goods they sell, and then core inflation rises. A second factor has also been the recovery in demand in the last six months, since the lifting of the pandemic restrictions. However, this second factor should play only a minor role next year, when the reopening phase of the economy is over and expenditure settles back into a more normal pattern. A third factor is that wages will be increasing, adding to costs across the economy.  As regards the medium-term prospects for inflation, the ECB has predicted an inflation level of 2.3% in 2024. Will inflation be closer to 2% in 2025, and in the medium term, when most of the pandemic and war-related factors have faded away, will there be more of an upside or downside risk to inflation?  Typically, you could expect inflation to get closer to our target with extra time. One reason is that we have raised interest rates already by quite a bit and we’ve said we’ll raise them again. This does not have an immediate effect on inflation, but over the next one or two years those higher interest rates will dampen demand, reduce expenditure, and therefore reduce the ability of firms to charge high prices and in turn limit the scope of unsustainable wage increases. So a basic reason why inflation will be closer to our target is the actions of our monetary policy. We also do think that we will not experience the same energy inflation every year. But let me also say, we do think there will be a second round of inflation. As we have already discussed, many sectors need to raise their prices because their costs have gone up. Many workers also have so far suffered a big reduction in their living standards, but we expect them to receive bigger pay increases next year and also in 2024 and 2025. These bigger pay increases will support expenditure and will also raise prices. That is why it will take some time to return to our 2% target. So the second round effects will drive inflation next year and in 2024.  After the measures taken, and considering the lag in the effect of monetary policy on the economy, is a more cautious approach to the next rate hikes appropriate? And should the brighter inflation outlook take some pressure off the need for further aggressive policy tightening?  The interest rate decisions we’ve taken since July have been cautious moves. Having a rate of -0.5% was no longer appropriate when inflation risks had gone up. So normalising monetary policy has been the prudent approach, and we have said that we still have more to do. But it is also true that we need to recognise that the interest rate decisions we have already made will help to reduce the inflation rate next year and the year after that. We do expect that more rate increases will be necessary, but a lot has been done already, so we will have to ensure we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook, and the risk factors when setting the interest rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis.  A few days ago, you said you didn’t see many arguments in favour of a 75 basis point increase in rates. Has your view changed, or has it now become stronger after the latest economic data?  Let me disagree with this description. What I said last week, and I will also say to you now, is that when we had very low interest rates, a move of 75 basis points was reasonably straightforward. So that made sense in September and in October. We will see in December what the correct decision will be. But the starting point is different now. We’ve already hiked rates by 200 basis points. We will still be guided by the inflation outlook. But we cannot decide on the appropriate size of the increase in any one meeting without considering the starting point. And the starting point is now a lot higher than where we were in previous meetings.   Does this mean that you are now suggesting smaller rate increments?  The higher starting point is one dimension of the debate, but of course in terms of the wider debate we will have to look at the overall outlook. The point I am making is that when we take future interest rate decisions, including in December, we should take into account the scale of what we have already done. So the basis for the decision will be different.  A lot of firms and households see the increase in rates as another burden on top of recession and inflation. Why isn’t recession enough to lower price pressures? How will the ECB ensure that there won’t be an unnecessary tightening for firms and households?  Our current thinking is that if there is a recession it will be relatively mild and relatively short-lived. If it is a recession of maybe six months and a mild one, then the reduction in aggregate demand in that case would be smaller. Compared to a more severe recession, a milder and shorter recession is good news for Europe but it does mean that its anti-inflation impact will be relatively limited. I appreciate that the burden of the interest rate increases will not be uniform. For example, the households who have a variable rate mortgage will be more exposed than those who have a long-term fixed rate mortgage. And firms with a lot of debt will be more affected; and the implications are different for start-ups than they are for mature firms.  Which indicators will the ECB look at to determine the terminal rate?  We will always take a comprehensive approach. As I have said in my blog last week and other speeches, there are no shortcuts. There is no kind of special indicator that can uniquely tell us what the terminal rate will be.  But can you specify the main elements considered?  It boils down to all the factors that influence the inflation outlook. So, first and foremost, the inflation forecast. Second, the risks around that forecast. Third, there are the other indicators of the inflation dynamics. But, of course, we also take into account what is going on in the rest of the world.  In what way?  For example, if we think that the economy in the rest of the world is slowing down, or that global central banks will reduce demand through their own monetary policies, then the rate that we need to deliver will be affected. So our assessment takes into account the inflation outlook for the euro area, the global inflation outlook and the global central bank outlook as well. But in the end, we will look at a band of rates, not a single terminal rate. And to navigate that zone, the meeting-by-meeting approach will allow us to assess our immediate interest rate decision in the context of the zone of possible terminal rates.  Is this band of rates now higher than at the last Governing Council meeting?  I’m going to wait until all the data arrive, and the outlook is developed by the whole Eurosystem. We need to wait for the new Eurosystem staff projections. Once we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook, we will examine the implications for the terminal rate.  On the TLTROs, were you surprised by the low repayments by banks in November and do you expect more in December?  It’s important not to focus on the November number, but on how much banks may repay between November, December and January. Every bank is in a different situation and has different end-of-year considerations regarding the role of TLTRO financing in relation to overall funding. In general terms we think that there will be a significant reduction in the TLTRO liabilities in the coming windows, which is in line with the policy change we made.  On the quantitative tightening (QT) instead, how will the ECB ensure a process without market volatility? In December will only the principles be defined, or something more, too, like a timetable or an actual start of the operation?  It makes sense to have a two-step process. The first step is to define the principles. The second is to finalise a calendar. But I think that by now there is a universal consensus that is not specific to the ECB, that QT should essentially be a background programme. We would make sure that it makes its contribution to monetary policy normalisation in a way that reinforces the primary instrument, which is setting rates. Our main focus will be setting the policy rate, and QT will be operating in the background, in a predictable, measured way.  Do you envisage a passive QT with a percentage of maturing bonds in the asset purchase programme (APP) not reinvested?  The exact way we will decide to run down the APP will be decided at the upcoming meetings. But it is fair to expect that we will follow a steady approach. Every central bank is different in terms of the maturity structure of its portfolio, but the APP will allow a steady approach to be appropriate.  How will the ECB ensure that the anti-spread shield – the TPI – is effective? If we see greater fragmentation owing to monetary tightening, will the ECB be ready to activate that instrument?  We are super clear: we have a very good understanding of what’s involved. We know central banks can be extremely effective in any type of market stabilisation intervention. So the ECB will be very effective in its response to any kind of unwarranted fragmentation or disruption of the transmission mechanism.  So there should be no doubt that we can be very powerful and effective in using the TPI.  Could more expansionary fiscal policies by governments push the ECB to hike interest rates further?  The basic answer is yes. If the euro area runs up larger fiscal deficits, this will increase overall demand in the economy and that will, in turn, imply higher interest rates to make sure that inflation returns to 2%. That is why we have made it clear that in the immediate response to the energy crisis, governments do still need to do a lot to protect the most vulnerable and to offer support to firms that face particular challenges. But it helps if this is temporary and targeted rather than excessively boosting aggregate demand on a persistent basis.  What should governments do?  If the interventions are temporary, then there shouldn’t be a big impact on the deficits next year or the year after, which is what matters over the medium term. It is also important to be targeted: you can help the most vulnerable, but in a way that is less costly than programmes with a wider reach. So, it is possible to support households and firms needing support with temporary and targeted measures. But, if deficits were to remain too high indefinitely, this would add to demand pressures.   What are the main changes linked to the energy crisis and what are the lasting effects in the medium to long term for the European economy?  A number of points can be made, assuming that there is only a limited reduction in energy prices so that these do not go back to pre-pandemic levels. Number one is that Europe will be collectively poorer because we are a big energy importer. Lower incomes due to these extra energy payments will reduce demand in the economy. Number two is that some firms that use a lot of energy will lose competitiveness on a global scale. So you would expect to see some industries relocate to regions where energy is cheaper. But then, there is also the third and more optimistic point.  What is that?  The response to the energy crisis is accelerating and will stimulate the green transition and investment in renewable energy. This will take some time, but then the energy supply will be more secure, because we will no longer be reliant on imports of fossil fuels. And it will be cheaper because renewable energy will have lower marginal costs. So, I do think there’s a very difficult period to come, but also a faster transition to a more sustainable economy.  What is your view on the European Commission’s proposals for the new Stability and Growth Pact?  There will be a debate on this topic, and let’s see the details of the decisions. But let me be very clear about this point: what is most important is that Europe agrees a fiscal framework as early as possible in 2023, because we really need it to help European governments make decisions for 2024 and later years. We need a fiscal anchor to make sure that governments are able to reconcile their response to the energy crisis with the commitment to sustainable debt in the medium term.  But for monetary policy, which is the bigger risk? Doing too much or too little?  It is important to recognise that the worst-case scenario is one where inflation remains too high for too long. History teaches us that it is very costly to get rid of entrenched inflation. We need to avoid that by making sure that inflation goes back to 2% in a timely manner. But, subject to that imperative, we also want to make sure that we’re efficient and that it is done in a way that does not lead to overshooting and to an excessive reduction in economic activity. So I don’t think it is a good idea to make a binary decision between too much or too little. There is a hierarchy: we need to get inflation back under control and towards the target. But we also need to recognise that once we are closer to target, the risk of overshooting may emerge.  Can you specify what you mean when you say that you want to get inflation back to 2% “in a timely manner”? In what way does the meaning of this expression differ from “in the medium term”?  This is a very important point. The ECB has always said that we have a medium-term approach, but without providing a precise definition. The medium term can be longer if the deviation of inflation is not too great, but should be shorter if we have a big inflation gap to fix. This is the case at the moment. So, we use the expression “in a timely manner” not to tie us to any particular year or period of time, but to essentially signal that we want to get inflation back to 2% at an appropriate speed and not to take too long. So, it’s not satisfactory to say that inflation will be at 2% many years from now. We have to make sure that inflation is back to 2% within a reasonable time horizon, and the Governing Council will decide exactly what that will be.  Some have criticised the ECB’s approach of focusing solely on inflation, sometimes even in the short term, thereby ignoring the effects on the economy and on financial stability. The mandate is for inflation, but could defending your credibility on prices lead the ECB to make decisions without a more comprehensive assessment of the economy?  We always consider all dimensions of the impact of our policies. We always make sure that we’re proportionate in our decisions. The primary focus is on inflation. What matters is the inflation outlook in the medium term, which also depends on the economy and is not only linked to current inflation. You can be confident that we will make sure we meet our price stability target, but without causing excessive side effects for the economy and financial stability.'\n",
      "Interview Original: '  INTERVIEW  Interview with Milano Finanza   Interview with Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Francesco Ninfole 6 December 2022  Has the euro zone reached peak inflation?  It’s probably too early to make that judgement, but I would be reasonably confident in saying that it is likely we are close to peak inflation. But whether this already is the peak or whether it will arrive at the start of 2023, is still uncertain. The main uncertainty is that we’ve seen so much volatility in gas prices. In some countries, consumer prices have moved a lot, while in others for example some utility companies have not yet finished hiking prices. Given the significant increase in prices, I don’t rule out some extra inflation early next year. Once we are past the initial months of 2023, later on in 2023 – in the spring or summer – we should see a sizeable drop in the inflation rate. That said, the journey of inflation from the current very high levels back to 2% will take time.  Next year, will inflation go down to 6-7%?  The initial downshift from the current high rates will be to around that level but I would expect further reductions throughout next year.  Is it possible that core inflation will go up while headline inflation goes down?   This could happen, because a big driver of core inflation at the moment is the fact that many sectors across the economy, such as transportation and tourism, use a lot of energy, so when there is a high increase in their energy costs, they have to raise the prices of the services and goods they sell, and then core inflation rises. A second factor has also been the recovery in demand in the last six months, since the lifting of the pandemic restrictions. However, this second factor should play only a minor role next year, when the reopening phase of the economy is over and expenditure settles back into a more normal pattern. A third factor is that wages will be increasing, adding to costs across the economy.  As regards the medium-term prospects for inflation, the ECB has predicted an inflation level of 2.3% in 2024. Will inflation be closer to 2% in 2025, and in the medium term, when most of the pandemic and war-related factors have faded away, will there be more of an upside or downside risk to inflation?  Typically, you could expect inflation to get closer to our target with extra time. One reason is that we have raised interest rates already by quite a bit and we’ve said we’ll raise them again. This does not have an immediate effect on inflation, but over the next one or two years those higher interest rates will dampen demand, reduce expenditure, and therefore reduce the ability of firms to charge high prices and in turn limit the scope of unsustainable wage increases. So a basic reason why inflation will be closer to our target is the actions of our monetary policy. We also do think that we will not experience the same energy inflation every year. But let me also say, we do think there will be a second round of inflation. As we have already discussed, many sectors need to raise their prices because their costs have gone up. Many workers also have so far suffered a big reduction in their living standards, but we expect them to receive bigger pay increases next year and also in 2024 and 2025. These bigger pay increases will support expenditure and will also raise prices. That is why it will take some time to return to our 2% target. So the second round effects will drive inflation next year and in 2024.  After the measures taken, and considering the lag in the effect of monetary policy on the economy, is a more cautious approach to the next rate hikes appropriate? And should the brighter inflation outlook take some pressure off the need for further aggressive policy tightening?  The interest rate decisions we’ve taken since July have been cautious moves. Having a rate of -0.5% was no longer appropriate when inflation risks had gone up. So normalising monetary policy has been the prudent approach, and we have said that we still have more to do. But it is also true that we need to recognise that the interest rate decisions we have already made will help to reduce the inflation rate next year and the year after that. We do expect that more rate increases will be necessary, but a lot has been done already, so we will have to ensure we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook, and the risk factors when setting the interest rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis.  A few days ago, you said you didn’t see many arguments in favour of a 75 basis point increase in rates. Has your view changed, or has it now become stronger after the latest economic data?  Let me disagree with this description. What I said last week, and I will also say to you now, is that when we had very low interest rates, a move of 75 basis points was reasonably straightforward. So that made sense in September and in October. We will see in December what the correct decision will be. But the starting point is different now. We’ve already hiked rates by 200 basis points. We will still be guided by the inflation outlook. But we cannot decide on the appropriate size of the increase in any one meeting without considering the starting point. And the starting point is now a lot higher than where we were in previous meetings.   Does this mean that you are now suggesting smaller rate increments?  The higher starting point is one dimension of the debate, but of course in terms of the wider debate we will have to look at the overall outlook. The point I am making is that when we take future interest rate decisions, including in December, we should take into account the scale of what we have already done. So the basis for the decision will be different.  A lot of firms and households see the increase in rates as another burden on top of recession and inflation. Why isn’t recession enough to lower price pressures? How will the ECB ensure that there won’t be an unnecessary tightening for firms and households?  Our current thinking is that if there is a recession it will be relatively mild and relatively short-lived. If it is a recession of maybe six months and a mild one, then the reduction in aggregate demand in that case would be smaller. Compared to a more severe recession, a milder and shorter recession is good news for Europe but it does mean that its anti-inflation impact will be relatively limited. I appreciate that the burden of the interest rate increases will not be uniform. For example, the households who have a variable rate mortgage will be more exposed than those who have a long-term fixed rate mortgage. And firms with a lot of debt will be more affected; and the implications are different for start-ups than they are for mature firms.  Which indicators will the ECB look at to determine the terminal rate?  We will always take a comprehensive approach. As I have said in my blog last week and other speeches, there are no shortcuts. There is no kind of special indicator that can uniquely tell us what the terminal rate will be.  But can you specify the main elements considered?  It boils down to all the factors that influence the inflation outlook. So, first and foremost, the inflation forecast. Second, the risks around that forecast. Third, there are the other indicators of the inflation dynamics. But, of course, we also take into account what is going on in the rest of the world.  In what way?  For example, if we think that the economy in the rest of the world is slowing down, or that global central banks will reduce demand through their own monetary policies, then the rate that we need to deliver will be affected. So our assessment takes into account the inflation outlook for the euro area, the global inflation outlook and the global central bank outlook as well. But in the end, we will look at a band of rates, not a single terminal rate. And to navigate that zone, the meeting-by-meeting approach will allow us to assess our immediate interest rate decision in the context of the zone of possible terminal rates.  Is this band of rates now higher than at the last Governing Council meeting?  I’m going to wait until all the data arrive, and the outlook is developed by the whole Eurosystem. We need to wait for the new Eurosystem staff projections. Once we have a good understanding of the inflation outlook, we will examine the implications for the terminal rate.  On the TLTROs, were you surprised by the low repayments by banks in November and do you expect more in December?  It’s important not to focus on the November number, but on how much banks may repay between November, December and January. Every bank is in a different situation and has different end-of-year considerations regarding the role of TLTRO financing in relation to overall funding. In general terms we think that there will be a significant reduction in the TLTRO liabilities in the coming windows, which is in line with the policy change we made.  On the quantitative tightening (QT) instead, how will the ECB ensure a process without market volatility? In December will only the principles be defined, or something more, too, like a timetable or an actual start of the operation?  It makes sense to have a two-step process. The first step is to define the principles. The second is to finalise a calendar.

      "Interview Preprocessed: 'The latest ECB forecasts weren’t much changed, some of the data is good, some of it not so good. What’s your view of the outlook at the moment?  I must say that since the last time we took action, the least one could say is that things in the economy have not gone for the worse. And even with sometimes conflicting incoming information, most of it has led us to say that the risk balance may still be somewhat to the downside but less so than it has been, and that led us to no change because we said we are broadly in line with our baseline. Looking also at new incoming information I think nothing is pointing to a further deterioration at least not on the front of prices and production. I do not speak on the health system, and that is why I have to bring in a caveat. This is based on an assumption that things continue as they are right now, that there is no major deterioration on the health front. Now a deterioration on the health front might not be only an increase of people being contaminated, it would be an increase in pressure on the health systems. New generalised lockdown measures which so far we have seen have by and large been resisted or applied in a more ‘surgical’ fashion. Since we do not exactly know in what direction the health situation will develop it is very difficult to draw very concrete conclusions on the development of our scenarios. At the beginning of the crisis or even until summer we had the feeling that between our baseline and the two extreme scenarios many thought we might came out somewhere in between. Now it looks as if we would be closer to the baseline scenario, maybe with chances to come out a bit closer to the upward scenario if the health situation is not deteriorating.  The second element of uncertainty is the feedback from the banking sector, let’s call it the financial amplification. Measures have been taken and this is not only measures from the monetary policy side: collateral, ample liquidity, the TLTROs, tiering PEPP. It is also the supervisory actions, the regulatory adjustment. And it is also the general ambience that Europe this time was able to not only have national reactions - which would have increased even more the already worrisome fragmentation that we see emerging in Europe again - but we also had a response at the European level. This was very supportive in trying to buffer the economic outfall. And you have seen that the trough, which is behind us, has been a little bit less steep than forecast, and the rebound is now being revised slightly upwards. So uncertainty remains. It is no reason to be only intelligent if you are more pessimistic than the one who spoke before you. There is no reason to be complacent. We have our programs, they have been extremely efficient, and we believe that they need to continue.  A lot of the actions you’ve taken this year are linked to this crisis phase. What are you using to assess where we are in the crisis, and at different stages of both the health and the economic crisis do different tools become more relevant?  It is obvious that the response that we will see on the health front - and that means not only finding a vaccine, but producing it and distributing it, and access to it - those are different questions to be answered and that will affect the sequence of the solution. So those are areas which are outside our span of control obviously but they will affect the strength of the rebound. And then there are areas of uncertainty which are closer to our area, and that is to what extent has such a shock induced structural shifts. And in order to give a good answer you have to distinguish first to what extent has this shock been working through the supply-side and the demand side. This is a very difficult question and we have seen different studies in this respect. By and large if I can cut the long story short, for the moment it looks as if the downfall in prices might be attributed roughly 50% to the demand side and 50% to the supply side. But - and this makes it a little bit more tricky - we see that the dynamics evolve as the situation develops. What has been downside for demand could suddenly become upside for demand, and for supply it is the same. What are the global value chains that will be most disrupted and to what extent will that create an upward price pressure, as restraint on supply meets piled-up demand. You might also have behavioural changes on the demand side. It’s very difficult to speculate on how people will react permanently, because some short-term reaction might not be persistent and then if you did factor in a structural change, you might be on the wrong side. For example, will there in the future be permanently less people in some sectors - leisure, tourism, those sectors that are most impacted - or will people revert to the normal consumption patterns once things clear up and a vaccine is distributed? It’s difficult to say. The distancing measures, will they be reinforced, will we stay with the present ones? The lockdown, will it be as strict as in the past? That’s why we have beyond our baseline the positive scenario and less positive scenario and we have to continue to monitor closely incoming information. We better err on the side of prudence. That means we have to provide ample liquidity to support the recovery amidst longer uncertainty. Now, on the instruments, of course, in some situations one instrument is more efficient and the Governing Council has signalled that asset purchases and TLTROs have presently more traction than our traditional instruments.  The economists that we’ve spoken to and markets in general are expecting more bond purchases at the December meeting. What are you thinking about what markets are saying and whether that matches up with what’s likely?  Of course the markets like if we buy up everything that they have. We will take our decisions on the basis of the whole euro area and on the basis of the shutdown in individual countries. And we will take decisions on the basis of the information that we have accumulated since our last decision-making. We are open-minded, but the open mindedness goes both ways. We always insist on symmetry. If the situation should hugely improve, our reaction should be the opposite of a reaction to a deterioration and also different from a continuation along the baseline. We have encouraged the banks to continue financing the economy. We have given them very favourable conditions through different instruments - the tiering, the TLTRO, the PELTRO - and the banks have done their job. We have also seen public guarantees that have been extremely helpful in maintaining asset quality, and we have seen the moratoria. But one day they will run off. Our concern is to avoid cliff effects. The cliff effects can be coming from both sides. Either the banks do not prepare sufficiently in advance - preparing in advance means recognizing impairments, increasing the provisioning, and we have given them capital space in order to do that. And: this capital space is not meant to be distributed to shareholders, it is meant for the economy. But as supervisors we certainly also need to insist that banks do proper risk management and acknowledge the recognition of impairment and do the appropriate provisioning. The banks’ capital situation has improved in the second quarter as much as it had deteriorated in the first quarter. The impairment has also doubled. But we could imagine further impairments as support measures unfold, structural change sets in, the pace of recovery is uncertain. If you compare with the situation under the great financial crisis I think we have reacted faster and more forcefully with all public-sector firepower in this crisis. But we have to continue to transform the cliffs into ramps. That needs the contribution not only of monetary policy, but also of other policy areas, especially fiscal policy.  What’s the importance of interest rates in this environment, and what some economists have described as the dual rate? Could there be a situation that as the crisis progresses and we see that lockdown restrictions don’t materialize in the very harsh way that we’ve seen before, where perhaps stimulus in the form of more PEPP isn’t the most appropriate tool?  We have never said that the interest rate is no more at our disposal. We have communicated in the past that we believe that the other instruments might have equivalent or superior effects in present circumstances. The next time we take a decision we again will do a holistic assessment of all our toolbox instruments and we will choose the one that we consider most appropriate in view of the situation. As to your underlying question, if we were to have a dual rate system we would have to look very carefully not to lose control and to keep traction with the instruments that would be most appropriate to transmit our monetary policy decisions.  It has been argued that a rate cut would be one of the best ways to tackle an appreciation of the euro. Is that an argument that makes sense to you?  I have to start by telling you…  … that you don’t target the exchange rate.  So that’s my first point. The second is that as Europeans we are very attached to multilateralism, and on exchange rates we have consensus language at the global level that has been valid for many years now, and that does not only speak about the exchange rates being in line with fundamentals but it also speaks about the volatility, excess volatility being disruptive.  This being said, it is obvious that the recent movement in the exchange rate has had statistical effects on some of our measures of inflation and production. And since we are very committed to price stability, we will certainly monitor the developments. So, we will monitor very closely the effects of exchange rate developments on our efforts to attain our objective of price stability, but this is by no way a change in strategy.  You were previously, but more so now, targeting a price stability goal which is somewhat different to the Fed’s goal.  We have had the numerical definition of price stability from our inception, we have been well served by our strategy and our definition of price stability, and I would add that we have been well served by having a definition that is medium term oriented. This medium term orientation gives us the necessary flexibility which is especially important in times of high uncertainty, and which allows also a time varying response function which takes into account the different effects of a shock. I’ve never been convinced to change a winning team.  It’s not entirely a winning team in terms of inflation though. It’s not entirely the ECB’s fault but inflation has been well below the goal for a very long time.  If you look over 22 years we do not need to hide. But if you have shocks for example as we see now - VAT reduction - or through commodities on which we have no influence - then we see through it. So it’s not by changing the goalposts that we will score more goals convincingly.  There was a report out recently suggesting that a sweeping review is being undertaken, and one argument in that is that the relatively high flexibility of PEPP could be copied over to the asset-purchase program. Is that true, and does it make sense?  I saw the article, but as a member of the Executive Board I am not aware of such a development. I can tell you that we look of course permanently at all developments. The PEPP has been created first and foremost to be a backstop to ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy decisions, and to be a backstop to provide liquidity. And it has been extremely efficient. In view of its sheer size it also has a second function, and that is to reinforce our monetary policy stance. But it is an emergency instrument created because of the pandemic. Take a democracy: It’s always easier to govern if you have emergency powers and you prolong the emergency powers forever. The PEPP is an emergency instrument. We have stated that we have disenfranchised ourselves from a certain number of self-imposed constraints in view of the pandemic and in view of its exceptional nature and threat - and that means it must be temporary. Now of course you can extend the temporary character, but the pandemic will not last forever. But unconstrained flexibility also increases the risk of arbitrariness. And in order to limit the arbitrariness of institutions, we have the scrutiny of jurisdictions. And we have publicly in the courts promised to jurisdictions what we were doing in order to protect the red lines that have been put into the Treaty, especially the monetary financing prohibition. So if you now say we have emergency instruments which do not need to respect these constraints, and we use them now also in our normal procedures, I do not know what the same jurisdictions would say in their future assessment.   So does that imply that the APP is not temporary?  It is subject to constraints vetted by the ECJ, and it is temporary as we have already once suspended it. The PEPP is exceptional and therefore temporary. We have always said it is linked to the assessment of the Governing Council on how long this pandemic is affecting us. So we cannot say the pandemic is over but we continue with the PEPP, or we transfer the PEPP features into the APP. To my humble understanding of what the law means this would be very curious.  President Lagarde said recently that a Eurosystem taskforce on the digital euro is due to present its findings in the coming weeks. How has this review affected your position on the matter?  We have a treaty obligation to promote safe and efficient payment systems, because they are supporting our monetary transmission mechanism. Therefore we must follow technological evolution very closely in order to be permanently able to serve our citizens. It's also extremely important that a central bank keeps a direct link to its citizens. That means with the emergence of non-European public and private initiatives as of late, there is also a discussion concerning European sovereignty and maintenance of the role of the currency. Cash is still in strong demand. Maybe in terms of payment it has receded a bit during the crisis, but the demand is still there. So we are ready to bring to our citizens what they ask. We want to give them a choice and we will give them a choice. That's the explanation why we also develop studies into a central bank digital currency. That doesn't mean we are rolling it out or implementing it, we are just conducting a thorough study as is being done in other jurisdictions.  Could we soon see experiments being run in the eurozone similar to what the PBOC is doing in China?  The PBOC has its own governance and its own strategy, we follow ours. There is a long list of questions that are not yet solved, and we will come closer to a solutions by doing small, real-time experiments.  There was a report by Buzzfeed talking about banks who are filing suspicious activity reports, and yet still moving money around. It suggests the banking system is still falling short in some areas. What's your view on that?  If they fall short they should stand up and be responsible for it. Some banks have been subject to close supervisory reviews and queries in the past, and as far as we know from all of the banks action has been taken. These are reports looking 10 or 12 years back. The banks have adjusted their governance and procedures. We are not in charge directly. We are awaiting new legislation from the Commission on anti-money laundering - all this is strengthening the European framework.  Your career goes back to the birth of the euro. For roughly half of that time the ECB struggled to hit its inflation goal. Not all of that is the ECB's fault, but you'll leave before the strategy review is completed. What is your lasting advice to the ECB and to your successor?  If the world changes and you do not change, then you are falling behind the curve and not fulfilling your role. You regularly have to do a re-assessment of yourself, your instruments, and your strategy. In the future it might make sense not to wait 18 years but rather to do it more often, especially if we face a higher number of shocks that we have no experience with, which might have structural change as a consequence. Secondly, you also do not change as a kind of fashion. It should reflect structural changes. Because otherwise you blur the perception in the public of what you stand for. We must be able to explain the strategy review to the public at large. Any change must be soundly warranted and explained. The measurement of inflation is one of the first work streams that has been internally discussed. On owner-occupied housing, we have made a lot of progress on how to collect information, how to distinguish what is the housing element from the investment element. Another question is whether we collect only prices of goods and services, or should look into experiences with a cost of living index rather than a CPI. There are a lot of discussions on this topic.That's my only regret -- I love this discussion, that is my life and I have to leave it.  The brand new element to this discussion is climate change, which President Lagarde is pushing pretty hard for. Are you comfortable with that?  It's a societal change that we will have to factor in. The difficult part is the circumscription, definition, there's a lot of greenwashing going around as well. But what is important is that it reaches the real economy, where it will have transformational capacities that will affect a lot of people. It's a question of transition and a transition needs to be financed. It's not all in the hands of central banks, we are at the end of it. If we are pushing awareness that's already a big contribution. If in the end central bankers are perceived as politicians, that would not be helpful in my opinion.'\n",
      "Interview Original: '   INTERVIEW  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, conducted by Paul Gordon and Carolynn Look 23 September 2020  The latest ECB forecasts weren’t much changed, some of the data is good, some of it not so good. What’s your view of the outlook at the moment?  I must say that since the last time we took action, the least one could say is that things in the economy have not gone for the worse. And even with sometimes conflicting incoming information, most of it has led us to say that the risk balance may still be somewhat to the downside but less so than it has been, and that led us to no change because we said we are broadly in line with our baseline. Looking also at new incoming information I think nothing is pointing to a further deterioration at least not on the front of prices and production. I do not speak on the health system, and that is why I have to bring in a caveat. This is based on an assumption that things continue as they are right now, that there is no major deterioration on the health front. Now a deterioration on the health front might not be only an increase of people being contaminated, it would be an increase in pressure on the health systems. New generalised lockdown measures which so far we have seen have by and large been resisted or applied in a more ‘surgical’ fashion. Since we do not exactly know in what direction the health situation will develop it is very difficult to draw very concrete conclusions on the development of our scenarios. At the beginning of the crisis or even until summer we had the feeling that between our baseline and the two extreme scenarios many thought we might came out somewhere in between. Now it looks as if we would be closer to the baseline scenario, maybe with chances to come out a bit closer to the upward scenario if the health situation is not deteriorating.  The second element of uncertainty is the feedback from the banking sector, let’s call it the financial amplification. Measures have been taken and this is not only measures from the monetary policy side: collateral, ample liquidity, the TLTROs, tiering PEPP. It is also the supervisory actions, the regulatory adjustment. And it is also the general ambience that Europe this time was able to not only have national reactions - which would have increased even more the already worrisome fragmentation that we see emerging in Europe again - but we also had a response at the European level. This was very supportive in trying to buffer the economic outfall. And you have seen that the trough, which is behind us, has been a little bit less steep than forecast, and the rebound is now being revised slightly upwards. So uncertainty remains. It is no reason to be only intelligent if you are more pessimistic than the one who spoke before you. There is no reason to be complacent. We have our programs, they have been extremely efficient, and we believe that they need to continue.  A lot of the actions you’ve taken this year are linked to this crisis phase. What are you using to assess where we are in the crisis, and at different stages of both the health and the economic crisis do different tools become more relevant?  It is obvious that the response that we will see on the health front - and that means not only finding a vaccine, but producing it and distributing it, and access to it - those are different questions to be answered and that will affect the sequence of the solution. So those are areas which are outside our span of control obviously but they will affect the strength of the rebound. And then there are areas of uncertainty which are closer to our area, and that is to what extent has such a shock induced structural shifts. And in order to give a good answer you have to distinguish first to what extent has this shock been working through the supply-side and the demand side. This is a very difficult question and we have seen different studies in this respect. By and large if I can cut the long story short, for the moment it looks as if the downfall in prices might be attributed roughly 50% to the demand side and 50% to the supply side. But - and this makes it a little bit more tricky - we see that the dynamics evolve as the situation develops. What has been downside for demand could suddenly become upside for demand, and for supply it is the same. What are the global value chains that will be most disrupted and to what extent will that create an upward price pressure, as restraint on supply meets piled-up demand. You might also have behavioural changes on the demand side. It’s very difficult to speculate on how people will react permanently, because some short-term reaction might not be persistent and then if you did factor in a structural change, you might be on the wrong side. For example, will there in the future be permanently less people in some sectors - leisure, tourism, those sectors that are most impacted - or will people revert to the normal consumption patterns once things clear up and a vaccine is distributed? It’s difficult to say. The distancing measures, will they be reinforced, will we stay with the present ones? The lockdown, will it be as strict as in the past? That’s why we have beyond our baseline the positive scenario and less positive scenario and we have to continue to monitor closely incoming information. We better err on the side of prudence. That means we have to provide ample liquidity to support the recovery amidst longer uncertainty. Now, on the instruments, of course, in some situations one instrument is more efficient and the Governing Council has signalled that asset purchases and TLTROs have presently more traction than our traditional instruments.  The economists that we’ve spoken to and markets in general are expecting more bond purchases at the December meeting. What are you thinking about what markets are saying and whether that matches up with what’s likely?  Of course the markets like if we buy up everything that they have. We will take our decisions on the basis of the whole euro area and on the basis of the shutdown in individual countries. And we will take decisions on the basis of the information that we have accumulated since our last decision-making. We are open-minded, but the open mindedness goes both ways. We always insist on symmetry. If the situation should hugely improve, our reaction should be the opposite of a reaction to a deterioration and also different from a continuation along the baseline. We have encouraged the banks to continue financing the economy. We have given them very favourable conditions through different instruments - the tiering, the TLTRO, the PELTRO - and the banks have done their job. We have also seen public guarantees that have been extremely helpful in maintaining asset quality, and we have seen the moratoria. But one day they will run off. Our concern is to avoid cliff effects. The cliff effects can be coming from both sides. Either the banks do not prepare sufficiently in advance - preparing in advance means recognizing impairments, increasing the provisioning, and we have given them capital space in order to do that. And: this capital space is not meant to be distributed to shareholders, it is meant for the economy. But as supervisors we certainly also need to insist that banks do proper risk management and acknowledge the recognition of impairment and do the appropriate provisioning. The banks’ capital situation has improved in the second quarter as much as it had deteriorated in the first quarter. The impairment has also doubled. But we could imagine further impairments as support measures unfold, structural change sets in, the pace of recovery is uncertain. If you compare with the situation under the great financial crisis I think we have reacted faster and more forcefully with all public-sector firepower in this crisis. But we have to continue to transform the cliffs into ramps. That needs the contribution not only of monetary policy, but also of other policy areas, especially fiscal policy.  What’s the importance of interest rates in this environment, and what some economists have described as the dual rate? Could there be a situation that as the crisis progresses and we see that lockdown restrictions don’t materialize in the very harsh way that we’ve seen before, where perhaps stimulus in the form of more PEPP isn’t the most appropriate tool?  We have never said that the interest rate is no more at our disposal. We have communicated in the past that we believe that the other instruments might have equivalent or superior effects in present circumstances. The next time we take a decision we again will do a holistic assessment of all our toolbox instruments and we will choose the one that we consider most appropriate in view of the situation. As to your underlying question, if we were to have a dual rate system we would have to look very carefully not to lose control and to keep traction with the instruments that would be most appropriate to transmit our monetary policy decisions.  It has been argued that a rate cut would be one of the best ways to tackle an appreciation of the euro. Is that an argument that makes sense to you?  I have to start by telling you…  … that you don’t target the exchange rate.  So that’s my first point. The second is that as Europeans we are very attached to multilateralism, and on exchange rates we have consensus language at the global level that has been valid for many years now, and that does not only speak about the exchange rates being in line with fundamentals but it also speaks about the volatility, excess volatility being disruptive.  This being said, it is obvious that the recent movement in the exchange rate has had statistical effects on some of our measures of inflation and production. And since we are very committed to price stability, we will certainly monitor the developments. So, we will monitor very closely the effects of exchange rate developments on our efforts to attain our objective of price stability, but this is by no way a change in strategy.  You were previously, but more so now, targeting a price stability goal which is somewhat different to the Fed’s goal.  We have had the numerical definition of price stability from our inception, we have been well served by our strategy and our definition of price stability, and I would add that we have been well served by having a definition that is medium term oriented. This medium term orientation gives us the necessary flexibility which is especially important in times of high uncertainty, and which allows also a time varying response function which takes into account the different effects of a shock. I’ve never been convinced to change a winning team.  It’s not entirely a winning team in terms of inflation though. It’s not entirely the ECB’s fault but inflation has been well below the goal for a very long time.  If you look over 22 years we do not need to hide. But if you have shocks for example as we see now - VAT reduction - or through commodities on which we have no influence - then we see through it. So it’s not by changing the goalposts that we will score more goals convincingly.  There was a report out recently suggesting that a sweeping review is being undertaken, and one argument in that is that the relatively high flexibility of PEPP could be copied over to the asset-purchase program. Is that true, and does it make sense?  I saw the article, but as a member of the Executive Board I am not aware of such a development. I can tell you that we look of course permanently at all developments. The PEPP has been created first and foremost to be a backstop to ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy decisions, and to be a backstop to provide liquidity. And it has been extremely efficient. In view of its sheer size it also has a second function, and that is to reinforce our monetary policy stance. But it is an emergency instrument created because of the pandemic. Take a democracy: It’s always easier to govern if you have emergency powers and you prolong the emergency powers forever. The PEPP is an emergency instrument. We have stated that we have disenfranchised ourselves from a certain number of self-imposed constraints in view of the pandemic and in view of its exceptional nature and threat - and that means it must be temporary. Now of course you can extend the temporary character, but the pandemic will not last forever. But unconstrained flexibility also increases the risk of arbitrariness. And in order to limit the arbitrariness of institutions, we have the scrutiny of jurisdictions. And we have publicly in the courts promised to jurisdictions what we were doing in order to protect the red lines that have been put into the Treaty, especially the monetary financing prohibition. So if you now say we have emergency instruments which do not need to respect these constraints, and we use them now also in our normal procedures, I do not know what the same jurisdictions would say in their future assessment.   So does that imply that the APP is not temporary?  It is subject to constraints vetted by the ECJ, and it is temporary as we have already once suspended it.

      "Interview Preprocessed: 'Good morning, Christine Lagarde. This is your first television interview in France since taking up your new position at the European Central Bank in November. Thank you for giving it to France 2 and Télématin. French people knew you as the Minister of Economy and then as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). And now, as head of the ECB, you have an even more powerful role and the financial markets scrutinise everything you say. Do you have to weigh every word?   You have to speak sparingly enough for your message to remain solid and credible. And central bankers obviously have to be careful in sending out signals because financial markets and analysts are watching and will draw certain conclusions in order to decipher what they should focus their efforts on and where they should move their funds to.   Let me briefly touch on France. Today is a day of strikes in protest against the pension reform which will be presented to the cabinet today. Are you in favour of this pension reform?   At the moment I am not in a position to assess the structure of the text. In terms of price stability, of the main economic indicators, we know it’s important for each and every citizen to have enough certainty as to what will happen when they retire in 10, 15 or 20 years’ time. So any reform that helps bring about that certainty and clarifies the future retirement landscape, and which does not generate any inequality, will be good for economic policy and for monetary policy. And that applies to all products involving future payment or returns.  Turning to monetary policy now, to the interest rates that are set by the ECB. These interest rates are persistently low, practically zero. So Europeans are earning next to nothing on their savings. In France, the interest rate on the Livret A is 0.5% and the return on life insurance is not much better. Inflation is eroding the savings of those on the lowest incomes.  That’s true. Both rates need to be seen in parallel: the rate of return and the rate of inflation. Above all, we need to ask why the rates are low. We are in an environment, in Europe but also in all of the advanced economies, where the rates are generally low and have fallen considerably over the past decade. So a readjustment is now taking place. Why are they low? Because the central banks’ mandate is to preserve price stability, and in particular to prevent us from slipping into deflation. To that end, they have to try to support the economy, to facilitate lending to firms and to encourage households to invest. For example, the cost of financing for young couples who want to buy their first apartment is extremely low at the moment, lower than it has ever been before. The same goes for firms wishing to invest in new production equipment, the rates have never been so low. Our current task is to encourage investment rather than to support savings at all costs. Investors are in a better position these days.   As you say, the situation is bad for savers but good for borrowers. For example, interest rates are even negative for countries like France – or even for corporations – if they want to borrow for a ten-year period. The more you borrow, the richer you get – it does seem to be the wrong way round.  It’s not a case of the more you borrow, the richer you get. It’s rather the more you borrow, the more you can improve your production equipment. And that goes for households when they buy a new apartment; for firms when they invest in new production equipment, when they increase their productivity; and for governments. It all depends on what you do with the money you borrow. First of all, you should borrow if you have the capacity to do so or if you have sufficient fiscal room for manoeuvre. But borrowing to invest in education, to invest in new technologies, to invest in research and development, to improve the factors of production in general, that’s a good investment, because it strengthens the economy and, by boosting growth, paves the way for job creation and improves the situation of households.   And to invest in ecological transition. At the European Central Bank, you want to tackle climate issues, which is something new. You have mentioned the “danger of doing nothing”, so, in a nutshell, what will you do?  We’re going to look at all the tools we have at our disposal: economic analysis, supervision – since part of the ECB looks after banking supervision – and the investments that we make in the context of some of our programmes, either on our own behalf or in the portfolio that we manage within the framework of the accommodative monetary policy that has been in place for several years. We’re going to look at how we can facilitate the identification of risk. That means that if you take a financial product, you won’t just take it at face value. You’re going to ask whether the company in question has considered climate-related risks. Has it asked what will happen if, in 5, 10 or 20 years, the assets have completely changed in value?  One final, quick question: your animal emblem, which I can see on your jacket, is the owl. What does that signify?  It signifies that I am neither a dove nor a hawk…  Neither lax nor orthodox.  Neither lax nor orthodox. We will try to combine our collective wisdom to define a monetary policy that is good for Europeans and that allows us to achieve, as I said before, price stability, growth and investment capacity, in the most low-carbon environment possible.  Thank you for your time. We wish you and all our viewers a very good day.'\n",

      "Interview Preprocessed: 'Mr Cœuré, the working group on stablecoins you’ve been chairing is expected to provide policy recommendations to G7 ministers on 17 October. What will be the gist of what you’re going to tell them?  It’s important to expand the discussion on global stablecoins to embrace the broader context of technological changes in payments so that we may have a wider discussion on the mix of solutions – both public and private – that can bring the benefits of technological improvements to the end users. Stablecoins are only one component of this discussion. They raise a multifaceted technological and regulatory debate, covering financial regulation and anti-money laundering, as well as non-financial issues such as privacy, data and taxes. Stablecoins also raise deeper public-policy issues, particularly regarding the definition of money and monetary sovereignty. The report offers a framework for exploring these and related topics. It helps to structure the discussion, starting with how global payments work, what the shortcomings are and how stablecoins fit into this discussion, before addressing a number of issues specifically related to global stablecoins.  How important is it to tackle the issue jointly at the global level?  It’s essential that the discussion of global stablecoins is inclusive. If and when stablecoins become live and reach global scale, they will have a different impact in different jurisdictions. Scale is important here. What we want to see is international cooperation and coordination on regulatory approaches, potentially leading, as needed, to international standards – which we already have in some fields such as payments. All jurisdictions are now reviewing existing regulation to see how it applies to stablecoins. In Europe, the European Commission is carrying out this review. We will have to consider whether the existing regulations suffice or whether they will have to be adapted to address stablecoins. That’s why this discussion is also taking place at the G20 level, and I would argue it should go beyond the G20 perimeter so we can reach out to developing countries too. We very much count on the IMF and the World Bank to help us on that.   Are any jurisdictions more vulnerable than others?  The stakes are probably higher in small, open, developing economies. On the one hand, they may enjoy more potential benefits in the form of cheaper and faster payments, in particular for cross-border payments and remittances, and more financial inclusion. On the other, they may incur higher costs owing to the possible risks relating to monetary policy transmission and monetary sovereignty, in particular in economies which are partly dollarised. “Dollarisation” can easily morph into “stablecoinisation” (with apologies for the neologism!). We’re flagging this in the report and it deserves closer consideration, which in my view the IMF should lead.  This is just the start of what looks like a long process of tackling the challenges of stablecoins. What would be the next immediate steps?  The plan is to pass the baton to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The FSB has launched a new working group on the regulatory implications of stablecoins, which I co-chair with Chia Der Jiun from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This group will focus on regulatory frameworks and approaches, starting with a stocktake of how different jurisdictions intend to deal with stablecoins. This will feed into a report that will be submitted for public consultation in April 2020.  Can you give us a flavour of the scope of the challenges stablecoin projects involve?  The list of issues raised by all stablecoin projects is already quite long, as you know from our July report. They relate to legal certainty – to put it simply, on what or whom is the stablecoin a claim – and also to the governance and the architecture of each project. Other aspects have to do with compliance with money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules and the question of whether a stablecoin payment system is safe and efficient enough. We can use existing international standards as a reference in this regard. Then there are issues related to operational resilience and cybersecurity, market integrity and investor protection, and data protection, particularly segregation between payment data and data being produced in a social network. And you have issues with tax compliance.  Whenever these projects are based on existing global networks, there’s a chance that they may reach a critical size very quickly, which raises additional potential issues relating to financial stability, monetary policy and the functioning of the international monetary system.  According to Kenneth Rogoff, some prominent central banker told him the goal is to regulate Libra into oblivion. Is that a sentiment you share?  The G7 report is not technology-specific and it is not company-specific. There are different stablecoin projects and there will be new ones. We want to set principles that are applicable to all. It’s too early in the process to say whether individual projects will meet these principles. There is certainly no judgement that stablecoins shouldn’t exist. In the case of Europe, neither the Commission nor the ECB intend to make Europe a no-fly zone for stablecoins. But stablecoins will have to meet the highest regulatory standards and adhere to broader public policy goals. When we talk about people’s money, there is no trade-off between innovation and safety. We want to see both, as we do for any payment instrument. Depending on the design and the details of each stablecoin initiative, the approval would be contingent on meeting the highest existing standards. It might also require new regulations and be contingent on adherence to broader public-policy goals. The bottom line is that the bar will be very high and it’s too early to tell whether it will be reached.  Are there any projects that might be easier to handle than others?  I see substantial differences between projects aimed at retail participants and those confined to the wholesale world. It’s more likely in my view that existing regulations would broadly apply to wholesale projects rather than to retail projects. But it’s all very tentative and there’s no conclusion yet.  With Libra, we’re looking at a player that’ll dominate the market. Is that a concern you have?  In the discussion on fintech regulation we’ve been accustomed to discussing small-scale projects. By and large, until recently, we’ve taken a sandbox approach to fintech regulation under which we could afford to give projects a chance and see how risks materialise. That’s possible when the project is small enough. But now we have an elephant in the sandbox. So that approach doesn’t work anymore. What happens if the coin reaches a global scale? You have questions relating to the fair use of client data and to possible services that may not be planned initially, but could develop in the ecosystem, like what happens if a deposit-taking or lending activity emerges around the stablecoin, in which case it should be regulated as banking activity.  Are we then at the beginning of an historic shift in our approach toward money and payments?   The payment universe, both locally and globally, has evolved very rapidly over the past five years. The last wave of technological change in payments was 20 years ago when central banks introduced real-time gross settlement systems (in our case, TARGET followed by TARGET2). The new wave is more focused on retail payments and driven by technology.  Before passing any judgement, we have to start from the principle that innovation is good because it makes payments cheaper and faster. That’s an area where we’re learning a great deal from our African and Latin American colleagues. There’s a lot of leapfrogging toward innovative solutions. In the end, the new landscape will be a mix of public and private solutions. So the key question for the years to come is how to combine core public infrastructures like the ECB’s fast payment platform, TIPS, with private systems, and what impulse central banks can give to make this happen in an integrated way. This is a particular challenge in Europe where the retail payment world remains fragmented along national lines. The Eurosystem is working on it. We’d better act fast here, because we don’t want this new world of payments to be dominated solely by US and Chinese actors. Europe has a particular interest in developing its own approach and standards so it can be safe and efficient at home and attractive as an international reference.  How do stablecoins, private and public, fit into this discussion?  Stablecoins have the potential to leverage technological change to bring new and cheaper services to customers – provided that the long list of risks I highlighted is addressed properly. You’re asking me whether a public stablecoin will also fit into this landscape. That’s an area where we’re treading very carefully because the prospects differ across jurisdictions. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) raise a number of serious questions to which we don’t yet have answers. Although they might look like an attractive proposition for individuals wishing to reap the benefits of technology while holding a safe store of value, they may have shortcomings of their own: there are many ways to implement CBDCs, which we need to study carefully. If they make bank funding more fragile and more vulnerable to liquidity shocks and bank runs, then they might be bad for financial stability and financial intermediation. Central banks shouldn’t have their heads in the sand and avoid that discussion. At the same time, we have to think through the consequences.  If people have access to digital central bank money, isn’t the central bank entering an unfair competition with the private sector?  If the demand for cash in a country collapses, citizens would be left with no option but to use commercial money, even for small payments. There’s a good case to be made that citizens should be offered the option of using central bank money for small payments, even in a digital world. You have an overarching public-policy goal, which is trust in the currency. But again, we have to think through the consequences. As long as CBDCs are using new technologies to do what we already do – issuing money – in a more cost-effective way, I’m all for it. But if that implies a world where the central bank is crowding out private banks and attracting all deposits; a world where the central bank is disintermediating private financial intermediation, then that would not be a place where we want to be, because we’re a market economy and we need competition to generate innovation in the first place.   All those arguments taken into account, are CBDCs part of our financial future?  I’m personally pretty sure CBDCs will come. I don’t know how and in which form. It may come in different ways in different jurisdictions. The nature of money will change. It’s not the first time this is happening – the nature of money has kept changing over the centuries. We’ve got to adapt so we can reap the benefits of technology. But the principles won’t change. I’m convinced that one key evolution that dates back to the 17th century will remain: you need a public institution to anchor trust in the currency. I don’t see any chance that we will move back to a system where money will only be issued by commercial entities and regulated by competition between these entities. Our economies are so complex that you need trust in the currency to be anchored in the rule of law. A social convention isn’t enough. It’s too fragile. That doesn’t mean everything needs to be public. To echo Ludwig Erhard, you need as much commercial money as possible to reap the benefits of innovation and competition, and you need as much public money as needed to anchor the trust in the currency.'\n",
      "Interview Original: '   INTERVIEW 17 October 2019  Interview with Bloomberg   Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Jana Randow and Piotr Skolimowski on 10 October and published on 17 October 2019  Mr Cœuré, the working group on stablecoins you’ve been chairing is expected to provide policy recommendations to G7 ministers on 17 October. What will be the gist of what you’re going to tell them?  It’s important to expand the discussion on global stablecoins to embrace the broader context of technological changes in payments so that we may have a wider discussion on the mix of solutions – both public and private – that can bring the benefits of technological improvements to the end users. Stablecoins are only one component of this discussion. They raise a multifaceted technological and regulatory debate, covering financial regulation and anti-money laundering, as well as non-financial issues such as privacy, data and taxes.
